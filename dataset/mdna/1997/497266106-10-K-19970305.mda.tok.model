effective july   the company began accounting for its investment in universal  its property and casualty insurance subsidiary  under the equity method of accounting as a result of a july redemption of universal s common stock  reducing the company s ownership to 
prior period financial statements have not been restated 
for the first six months and prior years  results for universal were consolidated  with a minority interest expense recorded for universal s minority shareholder 
the results included a  pre tax charge in the third quarter 
the after tax effect of the charge was  or

the company conducts operations in marine transportation and diesel repair business segments 
in addition  the company owns a voting interest in a property and casualty insurance company 
marine transportation the company s marine transportation segment reported transportation revenues of  a decrease of when compared with  reported for the year  and a increase when compared with  reported for the year 
operating income for the marine transportation segment for the year totaled  an increase of compared with  of operating income for and over operating income of  for comparative purposes  the transportation revenues for the and years included acquired assets during which contributed to the majority of the increase in revenues for and in july  the company acquired four offshore tankers and in november  the company acquired the transportation assets of dow 
the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
collectively  the acquisitions generated revenues for the year of approximately  from their dates of acquisition 
as provider of service for both the inland and offshore united states markets  the marine transportation segment is divided into two divisions organized around the markets they serve the inland division  serving the inland industrial chemical  petrochemical  agricultural chemical and refined products markets  and the offshore division  which serves the offshore refined petroleum products  dry bulk  container and palletized cargo markets 
a division analysis by years of marine transportation revenues follows marine transportation revenues the inland division s transportation revenues for totaled  or of total transportation revenues 
the division s revenues represent a increase compared with  reported in the inland division operated under long term contracts  short term contracts and spot movements of products 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of inland barge movements were under term contracts and approximately and  respectively  were spot market movements 
contract volumes for the movement of chemicals were stable and rates flat during  however  spot market volumes remained soft  with week to week variations in demand  and certain spot market pricing pressure 
the contract and spot market movements of refined products in the mississippi river declined to some degree 
such reduction in volumes resulted in lower rates for spot market river movements 
the gulf intracoastal waterway movements of refined products remained weak for the entire year  resulting in lower rates for such movements 
additional midwest refinery capacity and some improved pipeline efficiencies through debottle necking were the primary reasons for the decline in refined products volumes and rates 
the movements of liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia by the inland division are normally seasonal  coinciding with the spring and fall fertilizer seasons 
the fall fertilizer season  normally scheduled for late august and september  did not strengthen until mid october  delayed by relatively large remaining spring inventories  fertilizer plant production problems and terminal conversions  which resulted from environmental regulation requirements 
the offshore division s transportation revenues for totaled  or of total transportation revenues 
the division s revenues represent a decrease compared with  reported in the offshore division participates in the movement of both refined petroleum products and dry products and continued to experience periodic weaknesses in both markets  the result of excess equipment capacity and reduced demand for the movements of such products 
during the first nine months of  four of the company s seven product tankers operated under long term contracts and three operated in the spot market 
in october  one long term contract expired and that tanker began operating in the spot market 
from january through may  the tankers operated at close to full utilization with spot market rates increasing  reflecting the seasonal demands for the transportation of heating fuels and refined products to the northeast 
between the months of june and november  demand for the spot market tankers was soft  idling certain spot tankers for short durations of time 
during december  the demand for movements of heating fuels to the northeast resulted in full equipment utilization 
spot market rates during improved when compared with rates  reflecting a significant improvement during periods of high demand for product movements 
full recovery of the offshore tanker market is anticipated to be gradual  over the next few years  as offshore tankers are removed from service under the opa the company has no further mandated retirements until movements for the transportation of food aid and related products under the united states governments preference aid programs and military cargo movements continued to be sporadic for excess equipment capacity and a reduction in available movements continued to plague this offshore segment and have resulted in overall rates  if accepted  that may be inadequate to achieve profitability 
during  the company averaged only one of its break bulk freighters being employed 
in late september  upon completion of a food aid voyage to north korea  the freighter tampa bay was scrapped  taking advantage of its location to receive higher foreign scrap metal prices 
offshore barge tug unit operations during were strong  as the company s two tank barges and one dry bulk barge operated at close to full employment  except for scheduled shipyards 
the two tank barges are currently operating under term contracts  while the dry bulk barge has remained fully utilized in sugar  grain or scrap iron trades 
marine transportation revenues the inland division s transportation revenues for totaled  or of total transportation revenues 
such amount represented a increase compared with  reported in the inland division operated under long term contracts  short term contracts and spot movements of products 
as of december  and  approximately of such movements were under contracts and approximately were spot movements 
the acquisition from dow of inland tank barges and the assumption of the lease of inland tank barges from dow along with a ten year contract with dow to provide inland bulk liquid marine transportation services  contributed to the majority of the increase in over the demand for movements of industrial chemicals remained strong during the second half of benefited from the full integration of the dow fleet into the division s fleet and the achievement of operating efficiencies from such integration 
the movements of liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia is normally seasonal  coinciding with the spring and fall fertilizer season 
the upper mississippi river flooding  more fully described below  extended both the spring and fall season as demand was enhanced from the flooding of the midwest farmlands 
refined product movements were strong during  however  when compared with  movements were down slightly  as additional refinery capacity was added in the midwest united states and pipeline efficiencies to the midwest improved 
revenues from the offshore division for decreased to  representing of total transportation revenues for  from  reported in the offshore division  which participates in movements of both refined petroleum products and dry products  continued to experience weaknesses in certain of its offshore markets during  due primarily to excess equipment capacity and reduced demand for movements of certain products 
the offshore movements of refined petroleum products continued to experience weaknesses  however  the offshore operations improved during when compared with from both a utilization and rate standpoint 
the requirements for the use of reformulated gasoline under the clean air act in non attainment areas  effective january   was beneficial in placing eight of the company s eleven offshore vessels operating at that time under term charters that became effective during the fourth quarter 
such charters ranged from six months to three years at favorable rates 
during the first quarter  spot market rates of the three vessels operating in such market declined significantly  as the unusually mild winter in the northeast and imports of gasoline from europe decreased the normal movement of heating oil and refined products from the gulf coast to the northeast 
due to the lack of demand during the second quarter  three customers did not exercise renewal options for charters and the vessels were placed in the spot market 
during the third quarter  one spot market tanker was laid up  as rates did not justify an anticipated expenditure of approximately  to maintain the vessel s operating certificate 
the laid up tanker had an opa expiration date of october in anticipation of the idle tanker not returning to service  effective september   the tanker was written down by approximately  to scrap steel value upon the adoption of sfas no 
 and subsequently scrapped in march certain spot market tank vessels were laid up for various periods of time during due to weak demand for equipment and resulting low rates 
however  in december  the demand for tank vessels increased significantly due to the cold weather in the northeast and resulting low heating oil inventory levels 
such demand resulted in higher rates  although both demand and rates subsequently abated 
movements for the transportation of food aid and related products under the united states government s preference aid cargo programs and military cargo movements were sporadic during the year 
during portions of  all three freighters operated in this market were laid up at various times due to the market s excess capacity 
such excess capacity and lack of available cargoes resulted in rates that were inadequate to achieve profitability 
marine transportation revenues the inland division s revenues for totaled  or of total transportation revenues  an increase of compared with  reported in the inland division operated under long term contracts  short term contracts and spot movements of products 
as of december   approximately of such movements were under contracts and approximately under spot movements 
effective march  the division experienced spot rate increases  and the higher spot rates were conducive to increases in contract rates as contracts were renewed 
the inland division benefited from positive improvements in equipment utilization and rates  generated primarily from a hike in the business levels of the chemical manufacturers 
during the majority of the year  the division s river operation continued to experience pricing pressure in movements of chemicals in the ohio river market 
however  during the latter part of the year  the river operation did begin to strengthen as business levels tightened capacity 
the demand for movements of liquid fertilizers and anhydrous ammonia remained strong during all of acreage planting in the midwest farm belt increased  partially due to the low levels of grain commodities resulting from the upper mississippi river flooding 
rates for spot market movements of refined petroleum products remained higher than the majority of movements performed under contracts  however  as contracts were renewed  higher rates were received due to the continued improvement in spot market rates 
the division benefited substantially from the addition of inland tank barges acquired in december  along with a transportation contract through the year the asset acquisition and resulting contract substantially increased the division s market presence in the contract and spot movements of refined petroleum products on the mississippi river system 
revenues from the offshore division for increased to  representing of total transportation revenues for  compared with  reported in the offshore division  which participates in movements of both refined products and dry products  experienced weaknesses in all of its markets during the year  due primarily to excess equipment capacity and reduced demand for movements of products from each of the markets 
the offshore movements of refined products remained extremely weak during the year  with the exception of the first quarter and the latter portion of the fourth quarter 
during the first quarter  certain vessels were engaged in spot market trade delivering heating oil to the northeast due to the harsh winter season 
profitability of such spot market movements was adversely affected by the winter weather conditions  which hampered operating efficiencies 
during the second quarter  three of the division s offshore liquid vessels were idle and during the third quarter and early fourth quarter  as many as six of the division s offshore liquid vessels were idle  including the three tankers acquired in july spot market rates during the second  third and a portion of the fourth quarter were extremely low 
during the fourth quarter  the market for the offshore division s liquid equipment reflected significant improvements in both utilization and rates 
the requirements for the use of reformulated gasoline under the clean air act in nine non attainment areas  effective january   was beneficial in placing nine of the company s twelve offshore liquid vessels operating at that time under term contracts that became effective during the fourth quarter 
of the remaining three vessels  two were engaged in shorter term movements at satisfactory rates and one was out of service pending scrapping effective january   in compliance with the opa 
in addition  further temporary tightening of the offshore liquid market occurred in mid october  when the houston area san jacinto river flooding caused certain refined products pipelines serving the united states northeast to break  suspending service for varying periods of days 
movements for the transportation of food commodities and related products under the united states government s preference aid cargo programs and military household goods movements also remained weak 
excess equipment capacity and a reduction in available movements led to rates that were significantly lower than rates for the market 
such weakness in the market resulted in one of the division s freighters being idle for three weeks during the third quarter and one freighter was idle for the latter part of december 
the softness in the overall preference aid cargo market also negatively affected the division s other offshore dry cargo barge and tug units that primarily work under a long term contract with an electric utility company  but periodically operate in the preference aid market as a supplement to their long term contract movements 
marine transportation costs and expenses costs and expenses  excluding interest expense  for the marine transportation segment for the year totaled  a decrease of when compared with costs and expenses of  which excludes the  write down discussed below  and lower than the costs and expenses of  each of the comparable years were affected by the costs and expenses  including depreciation of the asset acquisitions  the inland tank barges placed in service since  and various existing equipment placed in service since  all of which is more fully described in business acquisitions and developments below 
in addition  each year reflected higher equipment costs  health and welfare costs  and inflationary increases in costs and expenses 
specific events which affected the costs and expenses for each of the last three years are more fully described below 
marine transportation costs and expenses effective january   the inland division changed the estimated depreciable lives of its inland tank barges and towboats 
vessel upgrades and enhanced maintenance standards have resulted in useful lives beyond the original estimated lives 
the change in the estimated lives provided a more consistent matching of revenues and depreciation expense over the economic useful lives of the inland barges and towboats 
the depreciable lives of inland double skin barges were changed from an average of years to years and inland towboats were changed from an average of years to years 
changes were made on single skin barges on a barge by barge basis  with shorter lives recorded in anticipation of early retirements when appropriate 
salvage values were also assigned to certain inland vessels where it was reasonable to expect that the vessel would have a residual value at the end of its depreciable life 
the result of the change in depreciable lives was to reduce depreciation expense by approximately   after taxes  or 
per share 
over the past eighteen months  the company has focused its efforts on decreasing costs and expenses and improving operating efficiencies 
in the inland division  reorganizational changes were made in offices have been closed and the division s sales  traffic  maintenance and accounting functions were consolidated to houston  texas 
the division is also implementing management information systems which is anticipated to improve operating efficiencies 
the company incurred reorganization expenses in of approximately   after taxes  or 
per share 
of the total reorganization expenses   were associated with the inland division and  were associated with the management group 
management anticipates that annualized costs savings  estimated at 
to 
per share  should be obtainable  phased in over a to year period 
as noted above  during  the offshore division operated seven offshore tankers versus nine for the majority of the year and twelve for the majority of the year 
also as noted above  the company s break bulk freighters  reduced from three to two in september with the scrapping of the tampa bay  experienced significant idle time during as the demand for such freighters has remained very sporadic 
in addition  the write down of the division s freighters in september  in accordance with sfas no 
 substantially reduced depreciation and amortization expense applicable to such freighters 
marine transportation costs and expenses as stated above  in september  the company adopted sfas no 
 which establishes standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles related to those assets to be held and used  and for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
the company reduced the carrying value of certain marine transportation equipment and related intangibles by taking a  pre tax charge in the third quarter 
the after tax effect of the charge was  or 
per share 
the company reviewed long term assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment by division  and by vessel class within each division 
for purposes of determining fair value  the company estimated future net cash expected to be generated  assuming the above asset groups 
approximately  of the  charge reduced the carrying value of the three freighters and related intangibles engaged in preference food aid cargo and military cargo movements 
freight rates  which have been depressed since  were not expected to recover to levels which would allow the freighters to make consistent contributions to earnings 
the freighters were reduced to a fair market value of  which was based upon estimated scrap steel prices if the freighters were scrapped 
in addition to the charge  the company also reduced administrative overhead associated with the freighters through employee reductions  office closure and internal merging of the shoreside support functions of the freighter operations with the tanker operations 
the inland division was negatively affected by the upper mississippi river system closure for all marine transportation movements from may through june  and  to a lesser extent  flooding in the arkansas river 
the closure of the upper river  the result of severe flooding  resulted in idle  delayed or diverted equipment equal to approximately of the inland division s tank barge fleet 
when the upper river opened  operations were impeded by channel silting which restricted drafts  and in some cases  briefly closed the upper river in certain areas 
the closure marked the second time in three years the upper river has closed due to flooding 
in the previous years  the upper river has closed only four times as a result of flooding 
the company estimated that operating income was reduced by approximately   after taxes  or 
per share from the effects of the upper river and arkansas river flooding 
additionally  in the third quarter  the illinois river was closed for lock repairs for almost the entire quarter and numerous hurricanes during affected the operating results of the inland division 
in  the company formed a captive insurance operation  oceanic  to insure the majority of risks previously self insured by the company and to access the reinsurance market directly 
during  the effect of insuring casualty losses  previously expensed on an incurred basis  was to increase insurance expense charged to the company s subsidiaries by approximately   after taxes  or 
per share 
marine transportation costs and expenses during the first quarter  one of the offshore division s dry cargo barge and tug units experienced difficulties with collection of its empty containers from several voyages carrying preference food aid cargo to haiti  which  during that time  was politically unstable 
collectively  the voyages to haiti reduced the company s first quarter earnings before taxes by an estimated   after taxes  or 
per share 
in february  the offshore division initiated a foreign flag container service which provided a direct all water transportation from memphis  tennessee to mexico and central america 
aggressive pricing from competitors resulted in slower than anticipated acceptance of the service 
volumes were increasing with each voyage  however  operating losses and the negative prospect for future profitability did not warrant continuation of the service 
the company discontinued the service in august the operation suffered operating losses during of approximately   after taxes  or 
per share 
additionally  shut down expenses totaled approximately   after taxes  or 
per share 
marine transportation operating income the inland division s operating income for the year totaled  substantially equal to the operating income of  and over operating income of  operating margins for were compared with for and for for  the offshore division s operating income totaled  a significant improvement over the reported operating income of  and the operating loss of  recorded in operating margins for were compared with for and a negative for the company s investment in two offshore marine partnerships  accounted for under the equity method of accounting for and  reported earnings for the year of  a increase compared with  for the improvement in earnings reflects the partnership s enhanced coal and limestone rock contract movements  as the year was negatively affected by scheduled maintenance of certain partnership vessels and lower coal volume requirements 
diesel repair the diesel repair segment is divided into three divisions organized around the markets they serve 
the marine diesel repair division operates on the gulf coast and west coast and in the midwest through three facilities that repair and overhaul marine diesel engines and reduction gears  and sells parts and accessories 
the rail diesel repair division is the exclusive distributor of aftermarket parts to shortline and industrial railroads for emd 
the division provides replacement parts  service and support nationwide to shortline railroads and industrial companies that operate locomotives 
the engine division  organized in july with the purchase of the assets of mkw  expanded the company s relationship with emd to an authorized distributorship for eastern states and the caribbean 
in addition  the engine division serves as a central distributor for woodward in southeast and midwest states  and as the exclusive worldwide distributor of emd products to the nuclear industry 
diesel repair revenue the company s diesel repair segment reported diesel repair revenues for the year of  reflecting a increase compared with  in and a increase compared with  for for comparative purposes  the diesel repair revenues for the year include the revenues from the acquisition in july of the assets of mkw 
such acquisition generated  in revenues during in addition  for and the marine diesel repair division  which operates in very competitive markets  benefited from the enhanced drilling activities and related oil service industries  and continued health of the inland tank barge and dry cargo industry in its gulf coast and midwest markets 
the east coast markets for and remained stable from military customers  however  the west coast market continued to reflect a decline as the division continued to shift its focus from the south pacific fishing fleet to the north pacific fishing fleet 
revenues for the year include the rail diesel repair division which commenced operations in january   generating revenue for of  in addition  the marine diesel repair division benefited during from the inland marine carriers rebound from the upper mississippi river flooding  which caused such carriers to curtail or postpone repairs and maintenance during diesel repair costs and expenses costs and expenses  excluding interest expense  for the diesel repair segment for totaled  compared with  for and  for the increase of for compared with reflected the costs and expenses associated with the commencement of the engine division and also reflected the overall continued growth in revenues from the marine and rail divisions 
the increase in over and increase from compared with also reflected the growth in revenues from both the marine and rail divisions  with being the commencement year for the rail division 
diesel repair operating income the diesel repair division s operating income for was  an increase of compared with operating income of  and over operating income of  operating margins for were compared with for and for property and casualty insurance and equity in earnings of unconsolidated insurance affiliate the company currently has a voting common stock ownership of universal  a full service property and casualty insurance company  which operates exclusively in the commonwealth of puerto rico 
on july   universal redeemed  of its common stock from the company and sold  of its common stock to eastern america group  thereby reducing the company s voting ownership from  prior to such redemption and sale  to the current 
such redemption and sale increased eastern america group s voting ownership from to the present 
no redemptions were made in effective july   the company began accounting for its investment in universal under the equity method of accounting 
prior period financial statements were not restated 
for the first six months  results for universal were consolidated with a minority interest expense recorded for eastern america s interest 
for the last six months of and for  the company s investment in universal was recorded under the equity method of accounting 
the amount recorded by the company as equity in earnings for the company s investment in universal is influenced to the extent that anticipated future redemptions by universal of its common stock exceeds the company s investment in universal s stock 
the company also has an investment in universal s nonvoting preferred stock 
because the preferred stock controls a separate portfolio of us treasury securities  the company accounts for this preferred stock under sfas therefore  the interest earned  as well as the realized gains from the sale of us treasury securities collateralizing the preferred stock  are included as part of equity in earnings of the insurance affiliate 
during and  the company recorded  and  respectively  of interest earned from its investment in us treasury securities and recognized  and  respectively  of realized gains from the sale of such us treasury securities  which are included in equity in earnings of insurance affiliate 
for the year  the company recorded equity in earnings from universal of  compared with equity in earnings for the second half of of and property and casualty insurance revenues for the first six months of  and for the and years  the company reported the results of universal on a consolidated basis  with a minority interest expense reported for eastern america group s voting ownership 
for the first six months of and the last six months of  eastern america group s ownership was compared with for the first six months of and for the year 
the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiary reported premiums written of  for the first six months of compared with premiums written of  for and  for net premiums earned for the first six months totaled  compared with  for and  for during  and for the first six months of  universal expanded its property and casualty insurance portfolio  with particular emphasis in the vehicle single interest and double interest lines of business 
such expansion was the result of new financial institution customers  portfolio transfers and a significant improvement in automobile sales in puerto rico 
in  the puerto rico excise tax rate on new united states manufactured automobiles sold in puerto rico was reduced  which resulted in a brisk improvement in automobiles sold and resulting improved premiums written under universal s automobile lines of business 
net premiums earned reflect the amortization of net premiums written over the life of a policy 
the substantial increase in net premiums earned for the first six months and the year was the result of the significant increase in premiums written in each year since the increase for each reporting period was negatively affected by higher reinsurance costs for the commercial multiple peril lines  associated with the ceding of a portion of the gross premiums written under the segment s reinsurance program 
investment income is generated primarily from the property and casualty insurance segment s investment in united states treasury securities  due to their investment safety and favorable puerto rico tax treatment 
investment income earned from the insurance segment totaled  for the first six months compared with  for and  for the growth in investment income for each period reflected the overall growth in the insurance segment and resulting increase in united states investment securities 
and property and casualty insurance costs and expenses property and casualty insurance costs and expenses for the first six months totaled  compared with  for and  for the increase for each period resulted from the significant increase in business volumes  particularly the vehicle double interest line  and favorable years for actual loss events 
the year included a reserve of  for potential  but as yet unreported  losses related to mariner 
during through  mariner participated in the writing of property and casualty reinsurance 
mariner received certain delayed large loss advices which resulted in the increase in the insurance loss revenues 
the year was the last year for participation in the reinsurance market

business acquisitions and developments in march  the company  through its subsidiary  americas marine  began all water marine transportation service between memphis  tennessee and mexico  guatemala  honduras and el salvador 
the transportation containership service utilized a chartered foreign flag river ocean vessel which offered direct sailing between these locations 
the service provided exporters and importers in the north  central and mid south states with a direct shipping alternative between the locations on a fourteen day round trip basis 
in august the company discontinued the service as aggressive pricing from competitors resulted in slower than anticipated acceptance of the service 
volumes were increasing with each voyage  however  operating losses and the negative prospects for future profitability did not warrant continuation of the service 
on july   a subsidiary of the company completed the purchase of a us flag tanker from tosco refining company tosco
