the company s issuance of common shares  use of the company s credit facilities and long term mortgage financing have been the principal sources of capital required to fund its growth 
in order to continue to expand and develop its portfolio of properties and other investments  the company intends to finance future acquisitions and growth through the most advantageous sources of capital available to the company at the time  which may include the sale of common stock  preferred stock or debt securities through public offerings or private placements  the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings and the reinvestment of proceeds from the disposition of assets 
the company s financing strategy is to maintain a strong and flexible financial position by i maintaining a prudent level of leverage  ii maintaining a large pool of unencumbered properties  iii managing its variable rate exposure  iv amortizing existing mortgages over the term of the leases for such mortgaged properties  and v maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio 
the company may seek variable rate financing from time to time if such financing appears advantageous in light of then prevailing market conditions 
in such case  the company will consider hedging against interest rate risk through interest rate protection agreements  interest rate swaps or other means 
in may  the company filed with the commission a million shelf registration statement which was increased in by million 
this registration statement was filed for the purpose of issuing debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares  common stock or warrants

on or after february   the preferred shares are redeemable by the company at per share in either shares of common stock or cash at the company s election 
the preferred shares rank senior to the company s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution or winding down of the company 
in december  the company obtained a two year unsecured revolving credit facility for up to million through december from a group of six banks the credit facility 
the actual amount available to the company is dependent on certain covenants such as the value of unencumbered assets and the ratio of earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization to fixed charges 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit facility and in february  this amount was repaid with proceeds from the company s preferred stock offering 
the total amount available under the credit facility based upon covenants at december  was approximately million 
the credit facility carries an interest rate of libor plus at december  
the company has an interest rate protection agreement which limits million of the outstanding balance on the credit facility to 
the company also has a million line of credit of which million was outstanding at december  and repaid in in april  the company formed a delaware limited partnership  erp  to own and manage certain real estate properties 
through  real estate properties have been contributed to erp and at december   erp s net real estate was approximately million and mortgages payable were million 
cash requirements in excess of cash from operations needed to facilitate these property acquisitions of approximately million were loaned to erp by the company 
it is anticipated that additional cash requirements to facilitate future growth would be principally loaned to erp by the company 
at december   million of erp s mortgage debt was guaranteed by the company 
in  the company loaned million to a joint venture partnership under a loan commitment related to a retail development retail project in orlando  florida  and in  an additional was advanced 
in january  the joint venture obtained a construction loan and million was repaid to the company 
the company has agreed to guarantee million of the construction loan which is expected to total million 
the company has elected reit status for federal income tax purposes and must distribute at least of its taxable income to its stockholders in order to avoid income taxes 
although the company receives most of its rental payments on a monthly basis  it intends to make quarterly distribution payments 
amounts accumulated for distributions will be invested by the company in short term marketable instruments including deposits at commercial banks  money market accounts  certificates of deposit  us government securities or other liquid investments including gnma  fnma  and fhlmc mortgage backed securities as the board of directors deems appropriate 
the company calculates funds from operations ffo as net income before gain or loss on real estate sales net of gain or loss on sales of undepreciated property  plus depreciation on real estate  amortization  amortized leasing commission costs and loan costs written off 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reits 
the company believes  however  that to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with its net income as reductions for certain items are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
the following information is included to show the items included in the company s ffo for the past three years in thousands except per share amounts net income    depreciation buildings    tenant improvements from equity investments amortization leasing commissions management contract organization costs loan costs written off sale of loan rate cap  gain loss on sale impairment of buildings   funds from operations    other information leasing commissions paid tenant improvements paid  building improvements paid only amortization of the management contract and organizational costs are shown as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the management contract was fully amortized in loan cost amortization and loan costs written off are classified as interest expense and leasing commission amortization is classified as part of other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
beginning in  the company revised its definition of ffo to exclude the amortization of loan costs and depreciation of furniture  equipment and vehicles as add back items 
under the previous definition  ffo was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
economic conditions the majority of the company s leases contain provisions deemed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  the company believes that many of its existing lease rates are below current market levels for comparable space and that upon renewal or re rental such rates may be increased to current market rates 
this belief is based upon an analysis of relevant market conditions  including a comparison of comparable market rental rates  and upon the fact that many of such leases have been in place for a number of years and may not contain escalation clauses sufficient to match the increase in market rental rates over such time 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans 
many regions of the united states  including regions in which the company owns property  may experience economic recessions 
such recessions  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some existing tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s shopping centers are typically anchored by discount department stores  supermarkets and drug stores which usually offer day to day necessities rather than high priced luxury items 
these types of tenants  in the experience of the company  generally continue to maintain their volume of sales despite a slowdown in economic conditions 
certain cautionary statements certain statements in this form k may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and other factors include  but are not limited to  the following risks economic performance and value of centers dependent on many factors 
real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
the economic performance and values of real estate can be affected by many factors  including changes in the national  regional and local economic climates  local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area  the attractiveness of the properties to tenants  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs 
in recent years  there has been a proliferation of new retailers and a growing consumer preference for value oriented shopping alternatives that have  among other factors  heightened competitive pressures 
in certain areas of the country  there may also be an oversupply of retail space 
as a consequence  many companies in all sectors of the retailing industry have encountered significant financial difficulties 
a substantial portion of the company s income is derived from rental revenues from retailers in neighborhood and community shopping centers 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company s financial results will not be adversely affected by these developments in the retail industry 
dependence on rental income from real property 
since substantially all of the company s income is derived from rental income from real property  the company s income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of the company s tenants were unable to meet their obligations to the company or if the company were unable to lease a significant amount of space in its properties on economically favorable lease terms 
there can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that the company will be able to re lease space on economically advantageous terms 
illiquidity of real estate investments 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore tend to limit the ability of the company to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  mortgage payments and  to the extent the properties are not subject to triple net leases  certain significant expenditures such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
should such events occur  the company s income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected 
a portion of the company s properties are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness  and if the company were unable to meet its mortgage payments  a loss could be sustained as a result of foreclosure on such properties by the mortgagee 
risk of bankruptcy of major tenants 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or a number of smaller tenants may have an adverse impact on the properties affected and on the income produced by such properties 
under bankruptcy law  a tenant has the option of assuming continuing or rejecting terminating any unexpired lease 
if the tenant assumes its lease with the company  the tenant must cure all defaults under the lease and provide the company with adequate assurance of its future performance under the lease 
if the tenant rejects the lease  the company s claim for breach of the lease would absent collateral securing the claim be treated as a general unsecured claim 
the amount of the claim would be capped at the amount owed for unpaid pre petition lease payments unrelated to the rejection  plus the greater of one years lease payments or of the remaining lease payments payable under the lease but not to exceed the amount of three years lease payments 
environmental risks 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  the company may be considered an owner or operator of real property or may have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its property or disposed of by it  as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property 
such liability may be imposed whether or not the company knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
reliance on major tenants 
as of december   the company s two largest tenants were wal mart stores  inc and kmart corporation which accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s annualized base rental income as of such date 
the financial position of the company and its ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by either of such tenants  or any other major tenant of the company  including a bankruptcy  insolvency or general downturn in business of any such tenant  or in the event any such tenant does not renew its leases as they expire 
control by directors and executive officers 
as of december   directors and executive officers of the company beneficially owned approximately of the company s common stock 
accordingly  such persons should continue to have substantial influence over the company and on the outcome of matters submitted to the company s stockholders for approval
