the company generates a substantial amount of its revenues from individually significant orders which can give rise to a concentration of revenues to individual customers and in geographic regions during particular fiscal periods  however  the company does not consider itself especially vulnerable to the loss of revenues from any customer or in any region of the world 
this increase in product revenues is consistent with the company s strategy of developing strategic market relationships with partners who have substantial influence in the company s targeted markets and the continued development of communications products suited to the emerging high growth economies
