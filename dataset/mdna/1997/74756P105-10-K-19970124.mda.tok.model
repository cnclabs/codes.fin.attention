liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the company s principal sources and uses of cash dollars in thousands fiscal year ended october  october  october  net cash provided by operations    nonoperating sources of cash proceeds from sale of common stock  net    borrowings of long term debt    nonoperating uses of cash acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired   purchase of property and equipment    repayment of long term debt    increase in notes receivable  cash flow generated from restaurant operations provides the company with a significant source of liquidity 
approximately  and of the funds required to construct restaurants and purchase other property and equipment were generated by operating activities during fiscal  and  respectively 
increases in current assets and current liabilities are due in large part to new restaurants opened during fiscal the company is able to operate effectively with negative working capital because substantially all sales are for cash and costs are generally payable in days 
similar increases in current assets and current liabilities are expected as the company continues its aggressive restaurant development program 
on april   the company amended its existing revolving credit facility 
the facility  as amended  provides for borrowings up to a maximum of million 
the interest rate paid by the company is the adjusted libor rate plus at october  
the loan agreement expires on april  and is unsecured 
as of october   there was million outstanding under this revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s primary cash requirements in fiscal will be to finance capital expenditures in connection with the opening of new restaurants and for general working capital purposes 
the company s capital expenditures budget is expected to range from million to million for fiscal during fiscal  the company anticipates opening to company owned bruegger s bagel bakeries  one or two grady s american grill restaurants  one or two italian dining restaurants  three to five burger king restaurants and three to five chili s 
the actual amount of the company s cash requirements for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new restaurants opened and the land acquisition costs associated with such restaurants 
with the exception of bruegger s bagel bakeries  the company expects to own the real estate for most of the new restaurants  leasing only when purchasing is not feasible 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations  together with amounts available under its revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to fund its planned internal expansion and other internal operating cash requirements through the end of fiscal if the company s bruegger s franchisees are to continue their aggressive development of bruegger s bagel bakeries  they must secure significant additional financing 
the company is considering various alternative programs to provide necessary financing to certain bruegger s franchisees to enable them to execute their development plans 
any such program will likely require the company to secure additional debt or equity funds 
although the company believes that it will be able to implement such a program on terms acceptable to the company and such franchisees  there can be no assurance thereof 
in the absence of an acceptable program  the continued development of new bakeries by the company s bruegger s franchisees could be adversely affected 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
increases in labor  food  and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operating procedures or increase menu prices to substantially offset increases in its operating costs 
this report contains certain forward looking statements  including statements about the company s development plans  that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following the availability and cost of suitable locations for new restaurants  the availability of capital to the company and its franchisees  the ability of the company and its franchisees to develop and operate their restaurants  the hiring  training and retention of skilled management and other restaurant personnel  the integration and assimilation of acquired concepts  the ability to upgrade the company s infrastructure to support its operations and development plans  the overall success of the company s franchisors  the ability to obtain the necessary government approvals and third party consents  and changes in governmental regulations  including increases in the minimum wage
