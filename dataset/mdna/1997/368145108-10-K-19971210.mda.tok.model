item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general demand for corrugated containers  containerboard and unbleached kraft paper is cyclical and has historically corresponded to changes in the rate of growth in the us economy and exchange rates for the us dollar 
growth in the us economy generally stimulates demand for packaging products 
in addition  weakness of the us dollar versus the currencies of the united states major trading partners stimulates domestic demand for corrugated products and makes export sales of containerboard more price competitive 
the cyclicality of demand is accentuated by the inelasticity of supply due to the capital intensive nature of the industry 
because productive capacity cannot be added quickly  during periods of rising demand containerboard and unbleached kraft paper inventory levels tend to fall  exerting upward pressure on prices 
in periods when capacity exceeds demand  efforts to control inventory levels are limited because containerboard and unbleached kraft paper mills operate most economically near capacity operating levels 
demand for unbleached kraft paper has declined in recent years due to displacement by plastics 
the company can vary its production of unbleached kraft paper  depending on market conditions  because all four of the company s paper machines that produce unbleached kraft paper also have the capability to produce containerboard

liquidity and capital resources general the company has historically financed its operations through cash provided by operations  borrowings under its credit agreements and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the company s principal uses of cash are to pay operating expenses  fund capital expenditures and service debt 
net cash used for operations for fiscal was million compared with cash provided by operations of million for the prior year 
the unfavorable comparison to fiscal was due to lower operating earnings and two semi annual interest payments in fiscal on the company s senior subordinated discount debentures due  on which interest had previously been accreting 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal decreased million from fiscal in addition to the capital spending  the company acquired million and million of equipment financed by capital leases or debt obligations secured by the assets acquired in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  the company initiated a five year capital plan that provides for a total investment of approximately million 
the plan targets approximately percent of the spending to enhance the capacity  flexibility and cost effectiveness of the company s converting facilities with the remainder to be invested in its paper mills 
the company is currently in the process of significantly expanding one converting plant and opened a new converting facility early in fiscal the company currently anticipates that its capital spending for fiscal an beyond will approximate its annual depreciation and amortization expense 
capital spending  however  will be adjusted from time to time as market conditions and available cash flows dictate 
at the end of fiscal  the company determined it would be unlikely that its antioch  california virgin fiber mill the east mill  which was closed in fiscal  could be sold as a mill site or that the east mill  or some portion thereof  could be operated economically by the company 
the company believed  and continues to believe  that the most likely outcome will be the sale of individual assets and the subsequent demolition of the remaining structures on the mill site 
in fiscal  the company incurred approximately million of costs for demolition and to maintain the east mill  such costs were partially offset by the sale of scrap 
demolition of the remaining structures on the mill site could require the company to incur costs for asbestos removal 
the company has deferred incurring substantial expenditures for demolition and asbestos removal until all uncertainties regarding disposition of the mill assets have been resolved 
management believes that it will be able to dispose of the east mill while avoiding a substantial portion of the previously recognized demolition and asbestos removal costs 
in addition  management believes that by avoiding such costs  the value the company will receive upon disposition of these assets will be substantially less than their previously recorded book value 
accordingly  the company has reduced the carrying value of the east mill by approximately million and recognized a corresponding reduction in its balance sheet accruals for demolition and asbestos removal 
at september   balance sheet accruals for demolition and asbestos removal were approximately million and the net book value of the east mill was million 
in fiscal  the company recognized non recurring operating charges of million 
these charges included i million primarily for equipment abandonments  asset write downs  lease termination costs and other costs related to the relocation of three of the company s converting facilities ii million for costs associated with closure of a corrugated container plant and iii million for a loss on the sale and costs associated with the disposition of a corrugated container plant 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  of costs associated with the fiscal non recurring operating charges to balance sheet accruals 
at september   the company had balance sheet accruals for such costs of million primarily lease termination costs and anticipates incurring such costs in fiscal the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock 
the shares may be repurchased from time to time on the open market and will be used for general corporate purposes  including issuances in connection with the company s employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
no shares were repurchased during fiscal during fiscal  the company purchased approximately million shares of its common stock  at a cost of million 
liquidity at september   the company had cash and equivalents of million  a decrease of million from september  as cash used for operations and investments exceeded cash provided by financing 
total debt increased by million from million at september  to million at september  the increase in total debt was primarily due to borrowings under the revolving portions of the company s credit agreements 
during fiscal  the company issued the new notes 
the company used the proceeds of the offering to redeem and retire all the outstanding old notes  to pay a redemption premium of million  accrued interest of million  fees and expenses of million  and to repay million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving portions of its credit agreements 
in fiscal the company amended its bank credit agreement to allow the issuance of the new notes and to modify certain financial covenants to increase its financial flexibility 
at september   the company had million outstanding and approximately million of credit available under the revolving portions of its credit agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at september   the company had primary working capital of million  a decrease of million from september   primarily due to lower accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower average net selling prices for the company s products 
during fiscal  published industry prices for linerboard decreased approximately percent from september with corresponding decreases in converted product prices  before recovering during the fourth quarter 
strengthening industry fundamentals  including year over year growth in corrugated product shipments  strong export demand for linerboard and reduced containerboard mill operating rates to control inventories  resulted in a per ton increase in published industry prices for containerboard in august and subsequent increases in converted product prices 
further  published industry prices for containerboard increased an additional per ton in october  and the company has announced a corresponding price increase for converted products 
average delivered prices for occ increased per ton  or approximately percent from per ton in fiscal  due to an increase in domestic demand 
in addition  average wood chip prices in fiscal increased approximately percent as a result of higher demand and unusually wet weather in the southern us the fiber market is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance of the future direction of occ and wood chip prices 
based upon current prices and raw material costs  and assuming maintenance levels of capital spending  the company believes that cash provided by operations and borrowings available under its credit agreements will provide adequate liquidity to meet debt service obligations and other liquidity requirements over the next to months 
unless there is continuing price improvement however  the company will need to seek covenant modifications to its credit agreement to maintain continued access to its liquidity
