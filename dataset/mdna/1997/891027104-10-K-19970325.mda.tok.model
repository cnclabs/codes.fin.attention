also in the fourth quarter of  as a part of the decision to dispose of the energy segment  torchmark wrote down its investment in a coalbed methane gas development in the black warrior basin of alabama to the investment s estimated realizable value 
torchmark had experienced disappointments in methane gas production through increased difficulties in obtaining significant gas production from lower coal seams  resulting in downward revisions to engineering estimates of reserves 
in view of these production difficulties  torchmark s desire to sell its energy segment  and the adoption of fasb statement  an accounting rule regarding impairments  it was determined that a writedown of the investment was appropriate

in a comparison of and results with those of  attention should be given to the acquisition of american income on november  for total consideration of million 
american income s results were consolidated with torchmark s after the acquisition date  being included for a full year in for the first time 
american income added approximately million and million to torchmark s and net income  respectively  after taking into account goodwill amortization and financing costs

operating expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were stable at in both and this expense ratio increased from in the higher expense ratios in and are related to increased legal and litigation costs at liberty

the following is a discussion of torchmark s operations by segment 
insurance life insurance 
life insurance premium increased in to million 
life premium grew to million for the year the versus comparison is distorted somewhat because of the american income acquisition in late american income life premium was million in  compared with million in  accounting for million of the million increase in life premium for sales of life insurance in terms of annualized premium were million in and million in this represents a decline in when compared with  a record year for torchmark  but the increase was over sales of million 
american income accounted for million of sales  or of the increase 
life insurance premium is torchmark s largest component of revenue  representing of total revenue and of total premium 
in  torchmark s life annualized premium in force at year end exceeded its health premium for the first time since in  the gap between life and health premium increased  as annualized life premium in force grew to of total as opposed to health premium s 
torchmark has emphasized increases in sales of life insurance product lines relative to health and other insurance products because profit margins for life insurance are superior 
additionally  assets backing the higher reserves required for life products provide the potential for torchmark to increase investment income 
profit margins for life insurance operations  as measured by insurance operating income as a percentage of premium  have approximated in each of the three years presented 
by contrast  health margins have not exceeded during the same three years 
annualized life premium in force climbed in to million at december annualized life premium in force also grew during  rising to million 
annualized premium in force data includes amounts collected on certain interest sensitive life products which are not recorded as premium income but exclude single premium income and policy account charges 
torchmark markets its life insurance products through a variety of different distribution channels 
the following table presents life insurance premium income during each of the three years ended december  by distribution method 
life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american exclusive agency    direct response    liberty national exclusive agency    american income exclusive agency    military    united investors exclusive agency    other    the direct response operation has experienced premium growth  with premium revenue rising in to million  after having risen in annualized life premium in force was million at december  direct response marketing is conducted through direct mail  co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  as well as direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
the direct response operation accounted for of torchmark s life insurance premium in the liberty national agency distribution system accounted for the most life insurance premium income in each of the three years presented  with premium representing of torchmark s total life premium 
annualized life premium in force grew from million at year end to million at the end of life premium sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  declined during to million 
during the past two years  this agency has completed the transition from a debit style renewal premium collection system to a direct bill or bank draft collection system 
at the beginning of  debit or home collection sales were discontinued 
under the new system  agents spend more time developing new customers 
as expected  a number of agents did not make the transition 
during the two year period  the agency force declined to  agents 
however  life insurance production only declined  which is evidence of the strength of the existing sales force 
in the fourth quarter of  emphasis was placed on hiring and training new agents under the new system 
the agency expects a growth in the number of productive agents  and in turn  growth in sales and in force 
another torchmark distribution system which experienced growth in life insurance operations was the american income agency 
this agency targets members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
life premium rose in to million 
annualized premium in force grew to million at december  annualized premium in force was million at year end  rising over year end sales of annualized premium increased to million in american income was acquired by torchmark in late torchmark distributes life insurance through a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and non commissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and non commissioned military officers and their families 
the quality of the business  which is comprised of whole life products with term insurance riders  produced by this agency is outstanding 
life premium income from this distribution system was million in  up million from this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition from another carrier of a block of business with million of annualized premium in force produced by the military agency 
in the past  this agency has produced business through liberty national  but beginning late in the first quarter of  additional sales will be produced through globe life 
torchmark s other three distribution channels each experienced premium growth in the united investors exclusive agency  made up of w r sales representatives  recorded premium income of million  increasing over premium for the united american exclusive agency rose to million 
annualized premium sold was million in  gaining 
the united american independent agency had life premium income growth of to million  and sales growth of to million 
the united investors agency represents of torchmark s life premium  while the two united american agencies represent

   amortization of acquisition costs    commissions and premium taxes    other expenses    total expense    insurance operating income    torchmark s life insurance margins have remained stable  with insurance operating income at approximately  throughout the three year period presented 
as a percentage of premium  operating expenses resumed their decline in  dropping to 
this expense ratio was five years ago and ten years ago 
one major factor in maintaining stable operating income margins in the life insurance business is improved persistency 
persistency is beneficial to margins because it lowers the rate of amortization of acquisition costs  and increases profits because the premium life is extended 
persistency improvements have resulted  at least in part  from previously mentioned changes in the liberty national agency marketing system  including revisions in agents compensation formulas to encourage lower lapses and changing the premium collection method from agent collected to bank draft and direct bill methods which are characterized by higher persistency 
another contributing factor to improved persistency in life business is a higher proportion of premium from the military distribution system  which has an extremely low lapse rate 
even though improvements in persistency have occurred in torchmark s major life insurance lines  acquisition cost ratios rose in each of the years reported 
in a comparison of and ratios with  the american income purchase must be taken into account 
while american income s life business is very profitable and has a total insurance operating income margin similar to other torchmark products  it is characterized by lower policy obligations and higher amortization of acquisition costs 
the higher acquisition cost ratio is a result of the higher amortization of the value of insurance purchased relative to deferred acquisition costs 
torchmark s discontinuance of active marketing of pre need funeral insurance has caused the amortization of acquisition cost on this business to increase relative to premium  although the impact on total margins are more than offset by a reduction in policy benefits ratios 
the above presentation of life insurance results excludes a million benefit in from the review of reserving assumptions on a block of burial reserves 
an evaluation of assumptions regarding mortality  interest  and inflation pressures on burial costs indicated that sufficient experience existed to support a change in the level of reserves held on this block 
torchmark will continue to monitor its reserving assumptions for this block on an annual basis to ensure that reserves are adequate to meet contractual liabilities 
had this item been included  the ratio of policy obligations to premium would have been reduced and overall margin would have been increased 
health insurance 
health products sold by torchmark include medicare supplement insurance  cancer insurance  long term care  and other under age limited benefit supplemental medical and hospitalization products 
as a percentage of annualized health premium in force at december   medicare supplement accounted for  cancer  and other products 
these products are marketed by exclusive and independent agents  by direct response  and through associations 
the table below presents health insurance premium income during each of the three years ended december  by distribution method 
health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american exclusive agency    direct response   liberty national exclusive agency    american income exclusive agency    the following chart contains health insurance premium data from through millions health premium change change change revenue annualized premium sales a major factor leading to the smaller decline in health sales over the three year period was the smaller decline in medicare supplement sales over the same period 
in  sales of medicare supplement insurance  the major component of torchmark s health insurance  increased over the prior year sales for the first time since the following chart demonstrates the smaller declines over the past three years for medicare supplement annualized premium sales and in force millions medicare supplement change change change sales in force the leveling of medicare supplement sales as compared to the prior year is due in part to million annualized premium sold through direct response  a distribution system not previously marketing this product 
in addition to higher sales than the previous year  medicare supplement in force benefited from premium rate increases implemented during the year  the first increase in three years 
in recent years  declines in medicare supplement premium issued and premium in force were the result of regulatory requirements that reduced allowable agents commissions on new sales  as well as uncertainties regarding health care reform by the clinton administration and congress 
further  regulatory standardization of policy benefits to standardized plans increased competition because consumers now see these products as a commodity  differentiated only by price 
increased competition by health maintenance organizations that substitute for traditional medicare also have dampened sales 
torchmark is using several strategies to maintain sales of new policies and the persistency of existing in force medicare supplement policies 
torchmark s premium rate increases year to year have been less than certain competitors  making torchmark s rates more price competitive 
in addition  new markets such as employer and association groups  and distribution methods such as direct response are being tested 
sales of cancer products declined to million in after rising in to million 
in spite of the lower sales  annualized premium in force for cancer increased to million at year end from million at december   due primarily to the implementation of rate increases for the first time in two years 
annualized premium in force for other health products experienced an drop in  from million to million at december  sales also declined in to million 
torchmark introduced a new series of long term care products in late  and intends to aggressively market this product line

   amortization of acquisition costs    commissions and premium taxes    other expense    total expense    insurance operating income    as a percentage of premium  insurance operating income for torchmark s health insurance was stable  approximating in each of the three years considered 
while policy obligations as a percentage of premium have risen each year  these increases have been more than offset by the declines in amortization of acquisition costs and commissions 
the decline in the amortization of acquisition costs ratio has been caused by improvements in persistency in torchmark s health business 
excluded from the above presentation of health results in is a million charge for cancer policy benefits resulting from a reclassification of non operating expense to health benefits  since actual payments will be made in the form of health benefits 
annuities 
torchmark s annuity products serve a wide range of markets  such as providing retirement income  funding prearranged funerals  and offering long term tax deferred growth opportunities 
annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among ten w r managed mutual funds which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
these investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as separate account liabilities 
annuity premium is accounted for as a deposit and is not reflected in income 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to policyholders on fixed annuities 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities 
annuity deposit balances annuity collections dollar amounts in dollar amounts in millions thousands fixed    variable      total       annuity premium collections increased in to million over the prior year 
annuity collections rose to million in fixed annuity premium collections declined in to million from million in  after having risen over three times collections of million 
the increase was caused by the entry of a united american general agency in the fourth quarter of that markets to bank customers 
these sales generated million in collections 
in  however  these sales declined to million 
additionally  torchmark s preneed annuity collections declined million in  contributing to the decline in fixed annuity collections 
more than offsetting the decline in of fixed collections was an increase in of variable annuity collections of 
these collections were million in as compared with million in strong financial markets in have contributed greatly to the growth in variable collections 
torchmark s variable annuities are issued by uilic and sold by w r sales representatives 
the variable annuity account balance also gained over the period  standing at billion at december  the deposit account balance is positively affected by additional deposits resulting from heightened investor interest and by the accounts being valued based on the higher market values of the underlying investments

   insurance operating margins for annuities as measured by the mean reserve have remained fairly stable throughout the three years examined 
annuity policy charges have increased in each period 
policy charges increased to million in these charges were million in  gaining over charges of million 
growth in these policy charges resulted from the increase in size of the annuity account balance over each of the prior years  the increase in the number of annuity contracts in force  and the cumulative effect of growth in sales over the past few years on which the sales charge is based 
the allocated investment income  or the investment income earned in excess of policy requirements  also grew in each of the periods through these increases resulted from the growth in the fixed annuity deposit balances 
asset management financial services 
torchmark s financial services operations consist of the marketing of mutual funds  including the united group and the w r group of funds through exclusive financial planners 
these representatives also market a variety of insurance products of torchmark subsidiaries 
financial services operations also involve the management of mutual fund portfolios  the management of institutional portfolios  and the servicing of customer accounts 
revenues are derived from commissions from the sale of investment and insurance products  fees for management of investment asset portfolios  and fees for servicing the accounts 
financial services revenues rose to million in compared with revenues of million 
these revenues grew in from revenues of million 
financial services revenues presented in torchmark s consolidated financial statements will not correspond to total revenues for the financial services segment presented below in the summary of results table because certain revenues are eliminated in consolidation 
asset management fees of million in were the largest component of financial services revenues  representing of segment revenues 
asset management fees grew in  after having gained to million in increases in these fees have occurred due to the daily growth in mutual fund assets and institutional assets under management  on which asset management fees are based 
average assets under management rose in and in growth in average assets under management in and resulted from two factors 
first  strength in the financial markets caused increases in the values of fund securities 
secondly  new net investment product sales and reinvested dividends in each period contributed to asset growth 
total assets under management were billion at december   an increase over the prior year end of 
total assets under management were billion at december  and billion at december   rising in mutual fund assets under management rose in to billion at year end asset management fees grew at a higher rate than assets under management in primarily because of a change in the type of assets under management 
the total increase in assets under management for the period of 
billion was the result of a billion increase in mutual fund assets partially offset by a billion decrease in institutional assets 
the mutual fund assets that were added have a higher management fee rate than the institutional assets that were lost 
commission revenues are derived from the sales of both investment and insurance products  with investment product commissions representing of total commission revenues in the commissions from insurance products and variable annuities are primarily received from torchmark insurance subsidiaries  and are eliminated in consolidation 
investment product commissions rose to million in  after having declined to million in investment product sales climbed in to billion 
investment product sales in were level with the sales of billion 
in  sales of the united funds  a front load product  increased or million while sales of the w r funds  a deferred load product  grew or million 
insurance product commissions have grown steadily  with commissions of million  as compared with million in and million in services fees grew in  after rising in service fees are charged based on the number of accounts serviced 
the number of accounts serviced was million at december   an increase of 
accounts serviced were million at year end and million at year end the fees grew at a rate greater than the number of accounts because of an increase in fees

pretax income for torchmark s financial services operations has grown very rapidly  rising to million in this growth follows a increase in to million and a increase in to million 
as a percentage of total financial services revenues  pretax income rose above in and remained comparable in the margin improvement resulted from a greater percentage of financial services revenues coming from asset management fees 
asset management fees have a significantly greater profit margin than commissions and service fees 
the proportion of asset management fees to total revenues remained constant in  contributing to the flat margin ratios 
while other expenses as a percentage of revenues declined  asset management fees were up about over commissions and selling expenses are the direct expenses associated with producing commission revenue 
they consist of the commissions  bonuses  and other compensation paid to the sales force as well as other marketing and promotional costs 
because of the increase in sales volume  which causes an increase in sales incentive compensation  direct expenses as a percentage of commission revenue rose slightly  from in to 
w r also increased promotional efforts in and to an even greater extent in the increase in commission revenues resulted  at least in part  from these measures 
investments torchmark s net investment income increased to million during the year  following an increase of in and a decrease of in when adjusted for the american income acquisition in late  however  the increase was 
the increase in investment income is principally due to the continued accumulation of invested assets  which rose to billion by year end 
when adjusted for disposition of torchmark s energy operations  mean invested assets rose in  as compared with a similar increase in the overall level of interest rates rose sharply during the first half of  then retracted approximately one half of the advance by year end 
in this environment  torchmark s investment program continued to emphasize investment grade  call protected corporate securities 
new investment acquisitions of fixed income securities totaled billion  compared with acquisitions of billion 
acquisitions in  however  were inflated by several sales programs implemented to reduce exposure to prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
during  acquisitions were made at an average yield of and an average life of years compared with and years  respectively  for while there were no significant sales of gnma holdings as in the past several years  mortgage backed securities declined because of repayments and the increase in other types of invested assets 
mortgage backed securities were of fixed income securities and of invested assets at december  they were of invested assets at year end and of invested assets at year end torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio is subject to market risk caused by changes in interest rates in financial markets 
because this portfolio is classified as available for sale  it is valued at market 
while the portfolio is sensitive to market fluctuations  these temporary changes in market value have no bearing on the ultimate proceeds at maturity 
torchmark limits its market risk by maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short average life 
the moderate increase in rates in caused the unrealized gain of the fixed income portfolio to decline 
at december   the market value of fixed income investments exceeded book value by million  compared with an unrealized gain of million at the end of and an unrealized loss of million at year end despite the fluctuation in market values  the portfolio yield remained relatively stable at  compared with at year end and at year end with shorter maturity acquisitions  the average life of the bond portfolio decreased from years at year end to years currently 
at year end  an estimated of the fixed income portfolio will maturity within five years  and will mature within years 
this compares with estimates of and  respectively  at year end presented below is a schedule of torchmark s fixed income portfolio by maturity

financial condition liquidity 
liquidity pertains to torchmark s ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark s liquidity is obtained from three sources its positive cash flow from operations  its portfolio of short term investments  and its line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance and asset management operations generate positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
cash flows provided from operations  including deposit product operations  were million in  compared with million in  an increase of 
operating cash flows grew in over cash flows of million 
the increase was primarily caused by increased deposit product sales in and a one time million tax settlement paid in related to prior periods 
in addition to operating cash flows  torchmark received million of investment maturities and repayments in  further enhancing total positive cash flow 
such repayments were million in and million in cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements 
torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at december   compared with million at year end these liquid assets represented approximately of total assets at december   the same as at the end of the previous year 
in addition to torchmark s liquid assets  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities which are available for sale should the need arise 
these securities had a value of billion at december  torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings up to a specified maximum amount 
the maximum amount was increased during to million at december  interest is charged at variable rates for borrowings 
this line of credit is further designated as a backup credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed million  whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time but may not borrow in excess of a total of million on the combined facilities 
at december   million in commercial paper was outstanding and there were no borrowings on the line of credit 
a facility fee is charged on the entire million balance 
in accordance with the agreements  torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings 
at december   torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
dividends are paid by subsidiaries to the parent in order to meet its dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations on an annual noncumulative basis or of surplus  in the absence of special approval  and distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth 
subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries has been and is expected to be more than adequate for parent company operations 
during  a maximum amount of million will be available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
capital resources 
the carrying amount of torchmark s long term debt was million at both year ends and major debt issues outstanding at december  were as follows principal amount instrument due rate thousands sinking fund debentures  senior notes  senior debentures  notes  notes  torchmark repaid thousand of principal on the senior debentures in under the terms of a put provision 
in connection with the american income purchase in november   torchmark issued eight million shares or million face amount cumulative monthly income preferred securities  series a mips in october  the mips were issued at an annual dividend rate of 
they are subject to a mandatory redemption in full at september   although torchmark may elect to extend the mips for up to an additional years if certain conditions are met 
they are redeemable at torchmark s option at any time after september  while torchmark is obligated to pay dividends at a fixed rate of  torchmark subsequently entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement with an unaffiliated party to reduce financing costs 
the swap agreement calls for torchmark to pay a variable rate on the million face amount in exchange for payment of the fixed dividend 
torchmark is at risk on this instrument for higher financing costs to the extent interest rates rise during the remaining term 
this risk is limited  however  by a five year interest rate cap which torchmark acquired in conjunction with the swap agreement that insures the variable rate cannot exceed 
at december   the variable rate was 
during  torchmark s after tax dividend cost for the mips was million  compared with million that would have been incurred without the swap and cap transactions 
torchmark s after tax cost in was million  saving million 
short term debt was million at year end  compared with million at the end of the previous year 
torchmark repaid million principal amount on this debt in  with funds from internal cash flow 
torchmark paid down a net of million on the credit facility during during  the torchmark board of directors and its financial advisor  morgan stanley  reviewed a number of restructuring options to possibly enhance shareholder value  including splitting the operations into separate publicly traded entities and selling all or portions thereof 
however  none of the reasonably achievable restructuring options provided sufficient likelihood of creating more long term shareholder value than the current structure 
accordingly  the following actions were agreed to and accomplished to the extent described in the following sections 
beginning in august  torchmark renewed its share repurchase program  and acquired million shares of its common stock at a cost of million by year end torchmark also intends to use excess cash flow to make additional open market purchases  as market conditions warrant  provided that its debt to capital ratio does not exceed and that no opportunities for acquisition offering superior returns are available

shareholders equity rose to billion at december   an increase of from december  shareholders equity of billion 
book value per share was at year end  compared with and at year ends and  respectively 
after adjusting for the impact of interest rate fluctuations on shareholders equity required by accounting rules  book value per share was at year end  an increase of over at year end comparative book value per share was at year end return from continuing operations on common shareholders equity was in  compared with in  even though average shareholders equity increased 
the return on equity ratios excludes the mark up or down of shareholders equity for changes in market interest rates required by accounting rules 
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization continues to decline  and was at december  in the computation of this ratio  the mips are counted as equity and the effect of the above mentioned accounting rule is excluded 
this debt to capitalization ratio was at year end and at year end torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest  taxes and discontinued operations to interest requirements was for  compared with in and in other items acquisition of american income 
on november   torchmark acquired american income for a total cash purchase price of approximately million 
american income sells life insurance to union  credit union  and other association members through exclusive agents 
the results of operations of american income were consolidated with those of torchmark after the purchase date 
funds for the purchase were provided through a million preferred security offering which is discussed in more detail in the capital resources section above  a million bridge loan from a group of banks  the sale of investments available for sale  and internal cash flow 
disposal of energy segment 
on september   torchmark completed the sale of its energy business segment including its energy asset management subsidiary  torch energy advisors incorporated teai  and its black warrior coalbed methane investment 
these operations  which were reclassified as discontinued operations in torchmark s financial statements at december   were sold to a teai management group 
after the sale  torchmark had no controlling ownership interest in any energy asset management organization 
in addition to previously transferred securities  warrants  and section energy related tax credits  which approximated million at closing  torchmark received subordinated debt and notes totalling million along with million in cash 
after closing costs and retained liabilities  torchmark recorded a pre tax loss of million and an after tax loss of million from the sale  or 
per share 
monetization of vesta stock 
torchmark filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission during the third quarter of the purpose of this statement was to monetize a substantial portion of torchmark s holdings of vesta insurance group  inc vesta common stock  by issuing a security mandatorily exchangeable for vesta stock at the option of torchmark 
torchmark currently holds approximately five million shares of vesta stock 
on november   torchmark withdrew this registration statement because market conditions were not favorable for the monetization of vesta stock at that time 
depending upon future market conditions  torchmark may refile the registration statement or otherwise provide for the monetization of a portion of all of the vesta stock  but currently has no plans to monetize this stock 
litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  most of which involve punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation has the potential for significant adverse results 
it is impossible to predict the extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case  since the amount of punitive damages in alabama is left largely to the discretion of the jury in each case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
also  the cancer policy class action litigation in alabama continued in in february  the alabama supreme court issued a notice overruling a petition for rehearing of its decision affirming the trial court s final approval of the may settlement of this litigation 
certain intervenors then filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the us supreme court  which granted certiorari in october oral arguments were heard on the intervenors petition in january on march   the us supreme court dismissed  as improvidently granted  the writ of certiorari it had previously granted  effectively ending direct appeals of the cancer policy class action settlement 
new accounting rules accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities fasb statement no 
is effective for transactions occurring after december   applied prospectively 
earlier or retrospective application is not permitted 
this statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  based on the concept of control 
the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on torchmark s financial condition or results
