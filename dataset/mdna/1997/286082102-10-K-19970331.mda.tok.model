for a complete discussion of the factors that could impact the company s results  please see the section below entitled factors that could adversely affect performance and the section entitled risk factors above 
results of operations the following tables set forth items in the company s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenue for  and  and the year to year percentage change for certain items in and these operating results are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
years ended december  revenue gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative income from operations other income income before taxes provision for taxes net income years ended december  change change total revenue    gross profit    operating expenses    net income    net income per share revenue the company s revenue was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively  and is generally attributable to the sale of fiery products during these periods 
substantially all of the company s sales in were to its oem partners  reflecting the company s new oem partnerships with ibm and digital and its continuing relationships with canon  xerox  ricoh  kodak  minolta and oce see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in revenue reflects continued market acceptance of the company s fiery xj and fiery xje products  the expansion of the company s sales and marketing organizations  and increased revenue from the company s oem sales channels due to the above mentioned market acceptance and an increase in the number of the company s oem partners 
the company completed agreements in the first quarter of with canon and digital equipment corporation  and in the second quarter of with ibm corporation  under which these companies are producing desktop color laser printers using the company s fiery xje controller 
the fiery xje controller is an embedded controller which  when combined with a specified color laser engine  results in a desktop color laser printer with superior speed and output quality 
international revenue continued to grow  from of revenue in to in direct sales into europe increased million to million and accounted for approximately of revenue in  compared to in and  respectively 
direct sales into japan increased million to million and accounted for approximately of revenue in  compared with and in and  respectively 
increased international revenue in each year was due primarily to the continued development of distribution channels  new agreements with certain oem partners and the company s continued investment in its international sales organizations 
further  shipments to some of the company s oem partners are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations  which in turn sell through to foreign locations 
as a result of these factors  the company believes that sales of its products into europe and japan may actually be higher  though accurate data is difficult to obtain 
the company expects that international revenue will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue 
during  the company introduced new generations of its fiery xj platform  including the fiery xj series of color servers  and broadened its product lines  including a fiery xj series of high speed servers for page per minute color copiers  the fiery xj w  a server for wide format printers  and a low end fiery si series for the under  market 
these product offerings were introduced in the latter half of and  while the initial response has been favorable  it is too soon to assess the extent of market acceptance 
the company continues to work on the development of products utilizing the fiery xj architecture and other products and intends to continue to introduce new generations of fiery products and other new product lines in cost of revenue the substantial majority of the company s cost of revenue to date has been attributable to the sale of fiery products 
such products are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
the company sources directly proprietary memory and certain asic components  and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which the company licenses from adobe systems  inc the company s gross margin was  and of revenue in   and  respectively 
overall gross margins in were favorably affected  beginning in the second quarter  by broad declines in market prices for dram and certain other components used in the company s products  combined with shipments late in the year of higher margin fiery xj units 
offsetting this favorable impact were the effect of certain reductions in average selling prices for selected fiery products and a change in the mix of sales as shipments of fiery xje controllers  sold at margins substantially lower than those of the company s other products  became a more noticeable portion of total revenue 
gross margins in were unfavorably impacted by the initial shipments in the fourth quarter of fiery xje controllers and by the reduction of shipments to independent canon dealers and distributors  pursuant to the company s agreement with canon  which were at higher margins than those achieved through the company s oem sales 
the company s gross margin depends in part on prices it is able to attain on its fiery products  fiery xje controllers and future products 
the lower manufacturing costs of the fiery models have given the company the flexibility to offer products with a broad range of prices 
in addition  as the company continues to introduce new fiery products  it may continue to lower prices on existing products 
the fiery xje controller will continue to have lower margins than the company s other products  reflecting the different distribution and marketing practices employed for desktop color laser printers 
accordingly  if the fiery xje controller continues to increase as a percentage of revenue  the company s overall gross margin is expected to decline  all other things being equal 
in general  gross margin will continue to be impacted by a variety of factors including  among others  the availability and pricing of key components including dram and postscript interpreter software  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of the company s product transitions and new products  competition  and general economic conditions 
the company expects to continue to take further steps to reduce product costs  expand product offerings and control operating expenses  however  no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
research and development expenses for research and development consist primarily of personnel expenses and  to a lesser extent  consulting and nonrecurring engineering services  depreciation  and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expenses were million or of revenue in  compared to million of revenue and million of revenue in and  respectively 
research and development expenses rose due primarily to costs associated with an growth in engineering headcount and increased depreciation  prototype and nonrecurring engineering expenses related to the development of fiery products 
the company believes that the development of new products and enhancement of existing products are essential to its continued success  and management intends to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development 
accordingly  the company expects that its research and development expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel expenses  costs for trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe and japan 
sales and marketing expenses for were million or of revenue  compared to million of revenue and million of revenue in and  respectively 
while sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue in both and  these expenses have increased in absolute dollars 
the increase in was due to a increase in headcount  primarily in the united states  and costs required for the introduction  promotion and support of fiery xj products 
the increase in was due to increases in headcount  also primarily in the united states  and costs related to the introduction  promotion and support of fiery xj products  including the fiery xje controller line 
decreases in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue are due to the company s increased sales to its oem partners and continuing cost control measures  including the consolidation in of certain duplicative european sales facilities 
the company expects that its sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue as it continues to actively promote its products  launch new fiery and other products  and build its sales and marketing organization  particularly in europe and japan 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and  to a lesser extent  depreciation and facility costs  professional fees and certain costs associated with public companies 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  compared to million of revenue and million of revenue in and  respectively 
while general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue in both and  these expenses have increased in absolute dollars 
the increases in and were primarily due to the addition of personnel to support the company s operations 
the company expects that its general and administrative expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue in order to support any growth in operations 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in  and in each year the company benefited from increased tax exempt income  increases in foreign sales and the utilization of research and development credits in achieving a consolidated effective tax rate lower than that prescribed by the respective taxing authorities 
the company anticipates that these benefits will continue to have a favorable impact on the company s consolidated effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million as of december   up from million as of december  working capital increased to million as of december   up from million as of december  these increases are primarily the result of profitable operations and stock related financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities was offset by an increased investment in inventory and accounts receivable due to growth in the company s business and by an increase in other current assets primarily related to consigned inventory sales to third party subcontractors 
the company s capital expenditures to date have generally consisted of investments in computers and related peripheral equipment for use in the company s operations and research and development  and office furniture 
the company purchased approximately million  million and million of such equipment and furniture during  and  respectively 
the company is working with the city of foster city to develop a corporate campus on a acre parcel of land in foster city 
the anticipated purchase price of this parcel is approximately million 
the company anticipates funding this purchase during the year ending december  net cash provided by financing activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively  were the result of exercises of common stock options and the related tax benefits 
the company s inventory consists primarily of memory subsystems which are consigned to third party contract manufacturers responsible for substantially all of the company s products 
should the company decide to purchase components and do its own manufacturing  or should it become necessary for the company to purchase and consign components other than the asic or memory subsystems for its contract manufacturers  inventory balances would increase significantly  thereby reducing the company s available cash resources 
further  these contract manufacturers produce substantially all of the company s products 
the company believes that  should the services of any of these contract manufacturers become unavailable  a significant negative impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations could result 
the company is also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations if such supply was reduced or not available 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable on february   to stockholders of record as of february  all references in the consolidated financial statements to average numbers of shares outstanding and related prices  per share amounts and stock option plan data have been restated to reflect the stock split 
the company believes that its existing capital resources together with cash generated from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund its operations and meet capital requirements through at least factors that could adversely affect performance the following may impact the company s future performance and financial results product transitions 
the company plans to introduce new fiery and other products in delays in the launch or availability of these new products could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
product transitions also carry the risk that customers will delay or cancel orders for existing models pending shipments of new models 
if the company is not able to successfully manage future product transitions or cannot guarantee the availability of products  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
new product introductions 
the company continues to look at opportunities to develop product lines distinct from the fiery line 
such new products may require the investment of capital for the development of new distribution and marketing channels at an unknown cost to the company 
there can be no guarantee that the company would be successful in the development of such channels or that any new products will gain market acceptance 
further  new products may directly impact the sales of the company s fiery products 
if the company is not able to successfully manage the introduction of new products  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
competition 
the company has seen competition in the marketplace from companies and products that provide similar functionality and believes that such competition will continue and may intensify 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully compete against other companies product offerings 
fiery xje 
the company is currently selling the fiery xje controller to canon  ibm and digital under oem agreements 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to recognize significant revenue from such sales or that the company will be successful in further marketing this product to other oem partners or other parties 
reliance on oem partners 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to supply products to each of its current oem partners 
in the event that an oem partner discontinues or reduces its level of purchases of fiery products  the company would experience a significant negative impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results 
operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as demand for the company s products  success and timing of the introduction of new products  price reductions by the company and its competitors  delay  cancellation or rescheduling of orders  product performance  seasonal purchasing patterns of its oem partners  performance of third party manufacturers  product inventory levels  availability of key components for the company s products  the status of the company s relationships with its oem partners and adobe  among others  the company s ability to develop and market new products  the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures  and the general demand for color copiers and color laser printers 
limited backlog 
the company typically does not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from its customers  and a substantial portion of the company s backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less 
customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times without penalty 
quarterly sales and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of the backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs 
if sales do not meet the company s expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall 
currency fluctuations 
the company realized approximately of its revenue in from sales outside the united states  including from japan 
as such  the company faces a continuing risk in that the strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen and major european currencies could adversely impact the company s revenues and gross margin through lower unit demand and the necessity to lower average selling prices to compensate for the reduced strength of local currencies 
volatility of stock price 
due to various factors  including those noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility for the company s common stock price
