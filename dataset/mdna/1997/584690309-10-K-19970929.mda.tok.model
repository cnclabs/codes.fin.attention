the company believes that sales of dynacin r products will continue to constitute a significant portion of net sales for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the sale of dynacin r products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dynacin r products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by regulatory or competitive changes 
the sale of dynacin r products could also be affected adversely by other factors  including manufacturing or supply interruptions  the development of new competitive pharmaceuticals to treat the conditions addressed by dynacin r products  technological advances  factors affecting the cost of production  marketing or pricing actions by one or more of the company s competitors  changes in the prescribing practices of dermatologists  changes in the reimbursement policies of third party payors  product liability claims or other factors 
see item  business products in development  manufacturing  certain license and royalty agreements  competition and government regulation 
uncertainty of future financial results  fluctuations in operating results the company s results of operations may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors  including expenditures incurred to acquire  license and promote pharmaceuticals  changes in prescribing practices of dermatologists  the level of research and development  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  cost increases from third party manufacturers  supply interruptions  the availability and cost of raw materials  the mix of products sold by the company  changes in marketing and sales expenditures  market acceptance of the company s products  competitive pricing pressures  and general economic and industry conditions that affect customer demand 
in addition  the company s business has historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations  with lower sales generally being experienced in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
as a result of customer buying patterns  a substantial portion of the company s revenues have been in the last month of each quarter 
the company schedules its inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  relatively small delays in the receipt of manufactured products could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
consequently  variations in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain or increase revenues or profitability or avoid losses in any future period 
intense competition  uncertainty of technological change the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive 
most of the company s competitors are large  well established pharmaceutical  chemical  cosmetic or health care companies with considerably greater financial  marketing  sales and technical resources than those available to the company 
additionally  many of the company s present and potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with the company s product lines 
the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid product development and technological change 
the company s products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions addressed by the company s products  technological advances affecting the cost of production  or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of the company s competitors 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of such developments

esoterica r primarily competes with porcelana  marketed by dep corp  and ambi  marketed by kiwi 
several of the company s products compete with generic non branded pharmaceuticals which purport to offer equivalent therapeutic benefits at a lower cost 
in some cases  insurers and other third party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products by paying or reimbursing a user or supplier of a branded prescription product a lower portion of the purchase price than would be paid or reimbursed for a generic product  making branded products less attractive  from a cost perspective  to buyers 
the aggressive pricing activities of the company s generic competitors and the payment and reimbursement policies of third party payors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see item  business competition 
dependence on new product introductions and acquisition strategy the company s strategy for growth is substantially dependent upon its continued ability to acquire products targeted at the dermatology market 
the company engages in limited proprietary research and development of new products and must rely upon the willingness of other companies to sell or license product lines 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  compete with the company to acquire such products

failure of the company to successfully introduce and market new products  whether internally developed or acquired from third parties  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
managing changing business the company s business strategy includes potential acquisitions of products and businesses and introductions of new products 
the company anticipates that the integration of new businesses or potential products  if any  would require significant management time and attention

the loss of any key person  or a reduction in the amount of time mr 
shacknai devotes to the company  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on licenses from others the company has acquired rights to manufacture  use or market certain of its products  as well as many of its other proposed products and technologies  pursuant to license agreements with third parties 
such agreements contain provisions requiring the company to use its best efforts or otherwise exercise diligence in pursuing market development for the subject products in order to maintain the rights granted under the agreements and may be canceled upon the company s failure to perform its payment obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will fulfill its obligations under one or more of such agreements due to insufficient resources  lack of successful product development  lack of product acceptance or other reasons 
the failure to satisfy the requirements of any such agreements may result in the loss of the company s rights under that agreement or under related agreements and have a material adverse effect on the company

see liquidity and capital resources 
uncertainty of access to capital during a portion of fiscal and prior years  the company s cash flow from operations was insufficient to cover its operating expenses  and the company relied on external financings to meet its needs for operating cash flow 
as a result of increased sales beginning in the latter half of  the company experienced an increase in accounts receivable 
the company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents  together with additional cash from operations and cash available from its credit facility and the proceeds of the offering completed in october  will be sufficient to meet its current liquidity requirements at least through the fiscal year ending june  however  depending upon the company s acquisition and licensing activity and results of operations  there can be no assurance that such resources will be sufficient 
if they are not  the company would need to obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such financing would be on terms advantageous to the company 
adequate additional funds  whether from the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available on a timely basis  on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
insufficient funds may cause the company to delay  scale back  or abandon some or all of its product acquisition  licensing  marketing or research and development programs or opportunities 
volatility of common stock price the market price for the stocks of many publicly traded pharmaceutical companies and marketers of dermatological products  including the company  is highly volatile 
a variety of events  both concerning and unrelated to the company and the markets in which it participates  may have a significant negative impact on the market price of the common stock 
these factors include regulatory developments in the health care field generally  the performance of and product announcements by other pharmaceutical companies  manufacturing or supply disruptions  product recalls  the loss of key personnel  and other matters affecting the company s products  acquisitions and financial performance 
although the company s common stock trades on the nasdaq national market  trading volume  size of institutional holdings and the number of marketmakers has fluctuated and  in the past  has been quite low 
both the price and volume of trading has been sensitive to the number of analysts reporting on the company and such analysts comments concerning the company and the industry in which it participates 
the realization of any of the risks described in these certain factors affecting forward looking statements could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
control by directors and officers as of september   the company s directors and officers beneficially own  shares of class a common stock  which have one vote per share  and  shares of class b common stock  which have votes per share  representing approximately of the company s outstanding capital stock and of the total voting power 
accordingly  such individuals  if they vote together  are able to exercise substantial power in the election of directors and thereby influence the policies of the company 
market risk of shares eligible for future sales subject to certain specified exceptions relating to charitable gifts  estate planning transfers and sales relating to the exercise of expiring options  directors and executive officers of the company hold in the aggregate  as of september    shares of common stock representing of the shares outstanding 
sales by such officers and directors are generally subject to the provisions of rule under the securities act 
the sale of a significant number of restricted securities  the exercise of a significant number of options  or the offer or sale of a significant number of shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of options at any one time could materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
anti takeover effect of charter provisions  rights plan  delaware law the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorized the board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock
