item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company generated net income during fiscal  operating income during fiscal and and focused on increasing penetration and subscriber usage 
in addition  the company expects that operating income before depreciation and amortization ebitda  which was positive during the fiscal years ended september  and  will also be positive in future fiscal years although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
certain financial analysts consider ebitda a meaningful measure of an entity s ability to meet long term financial obligations  and growth in ebitda a meaningful barometer of future profitability  especially in a capital intensive industry such as cellular telecommunications 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation to  or be construed as having greater significance than  other indicators of an entity s performance 
the results discussed below may not be indicative of future results 
consolidated results of operations include the revenues and expenses of those markets in which the company holds a greater than interest 
the results of operations of markets are included in the consolidated results for both fiscal years ended september  and september  consolidated results of operations also include the operations of cellular  inc financial corporation cifc  the company s wholly owned financing subsidiary  as well as the operations of cellular inc network corporation cinc  a wholly owned subsidiary through which the company holds interests in certain cellular licenses 
ii equity in net loss of affiliates includes the company s share of net loss in the markets in which the company s interest is or less but or greater 
markets in which the company s interest is less than are accounted for under the cost method 
eighteen markets were accounted for under the equity method and markets were accounted for under the cost method for both fiscal years ended september  and september  interest income reflects interest income derived from the financing activities of cifc and the company with nonconsolidated affiliates  as well as interest income derived from cash and short term investments of the company and its consolidated affiliates 
cifc has entered into loan agreements with the company s affiliates pursuant to which cifc makes loans to such entities for the purpose of financing or refinancing the affiliates costs of construction and operation of cellular telephone systems 
such loans are financed with funds borrowed by cifc from cobank  acb  as agent for a syndicate of lenders cobank and from the company 
at september   six loans bore interest at the average cost of cobank borrowings and bore interest at the day libor rate plus a margin determined based on the affiliate s leverage ratio 
from time to time  the company advances funds on an interim basis to affiliates 
these advances typically are refinanced through cifc 
to the extent that the cellular markets in which the company holds an interest generate positive cash flow  the cash is generally used to repay borrowings by the affiliates from cifc and thereafter will be used to make cash distributions to equity holders  including the company 
management believes there exists a seasonality in both service revenues  which tend to increase more rapidly in the third and fourth fiscal quarters  and operating expenses  which tend to be highest in the first fiscal quarter due to increased marketing activities and customer growth  which may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter 
in addition to historical information  this report includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends which may affect the company s future operating results and financial position 
such statements represent the company s reasonable judgment on the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results and financial position to differ materially 
such factors include  but are not limited to a change in economic conditions in the company s markets which adversely affects the level of demand for wireless services  greater than anticipated competition resulting in price reductions  new product offerings  or higher customer acquisition costs  better than expected customer growth necessitating increased investment in network capacity  negative economies that could result if one or more agreements to manage markets are not renewed  increased cellular fraud  the impact of new business opportunities requiring significant initial investments  and the impact of deployment of new technologies on capital spending 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year cellular service revenues  including in roaming revenues  increased by  or  from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  the growth was primarily due to the increase in the number of subscribers in consolidated markets 
in addition to increases in market penetration  growth resulted from an increase in the number of markets consolidated for the entire year from during the year ended september  to during the year ended september  growth in subscribers accounted for of the increase  and the number of consolidated markets accounted for of the increase 
in roaming revenues increased by  or  from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  due to increased coverage in cellular markets and to industry wide subscriber increases 
in roaming revenues are expected to increase in the future as a result of further industry wide growth in subscribers and expansion of the company s coverage  particularly along highway corridors  however  roaming rates are expected to decline  consistent with industry trends 
average monthly revenue per subscriber  including in roaming  decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september   reflecting the benefit of declining prices to the consumer which is consistent with an overall industry trend 
in roaming revenues per subscriber per month was unchanged at ii cost of cellular service decreased as a percentage of service revenues from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  as revenues derived from the growing subscriber base outpaced the fixed components of cost of service 
the company has renegotiated some interconnect agreements for lower prices and is in the process of renegotiating others 
the company expects cost of cellular service to continue to decline as a percentage of service revenues as revenues continue to outpace the fixed components of cost of service and as a result of negotiations completed during fiscal that reduced interconnection rates 
equipment sales increased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  due primarily to increases in sales of accessories 
this increase was partially offset by the effects of the company s customer satisfaction and pricing program which was introduced in february allowing subscribers to use handsets and accessories at virtually no cost at the time of activation 
cost of equipment sales increased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  approximately  and  of the year ended september  cost of equipment sales relates to equipment provided to new and existing customers  respectively 
customers are generally required to return equipment to the company if service is terminated 
although the company retains ownership of the equipment  it carries such equipment at no value on its balance sheet 
the company expects negative equipment margins in the future as the company subsidizes use of handsets to shift consumer focus to the value of cellular service 
general and administrative costs of cellular operations increased from  during the year ended september  to  during the year ended september   due to the growth in the customer base 
the majority of these costs were incremental customer billing expense  bad debt expense and customer service support staff 
in addition  bad debt expense increased from of total revenues during the year ended september  to of total revenues during the year ended september  general and administrative costs as a percentage of service revenues remained unchanged at for the year ended september  and the year ended september  the company expects bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues to decrease in future periods as collection efforts intensify

marketing costs per gross new subscriber decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september   as a result of increased gross subscriber additions which outpaced increases in costs incurred 
in addition  the company continues to expand its retail presence to capitalize on retail trade while driving down commission costs 
in october  three rsa licensees purported to notify the company of termination of management agreements in those markets during fiscal the company is assessing its response to these notices 
however  certain economies of scale for the remaining managed markets may be diminished unless cost cutting measures take effect concurrent with management changes should such changes occur 
depreciation and amortization relating to cellular operations increased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september   primarily related to increased property and equipment balances 
corporate costs and expenses for the year ended september  were  which represented gross expenses of  less amounts allocated to nonconsolidated affiliates of  corporate costs and expenses for the year ended september  were  which represented gross expenses of  less amounts allocated to nonconsolidated affiliates of  the decrease was due primarily to the write off of certain assets totaling approximately  related to the company s corporate office move during the year ended september   offset by costs and expenses to develop operations of cpi incurred during the fiscal year ended september  which were not allocated to affiliates 
corporate costs and expenses are expected to decrease slightly in future periods because cpi operations are expected to expand resulting in separate line of business reporting of cpi revenues and costs and expenses 
ii equity in net loss of affiliates increased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  the increase was due primarily to decreased losses in nonconsolidated affiliates  offset by recognition of the entire  net loss of tvx  inc which was  higher than the company s proportionate share of the net loss based upon ownership 
this accounting reflects that the company was the sole source of funding of tvx  inc in addition  during the quarter ended september   the company recorded an approximate  reserve related to its investment in tvx  inc which is reflected in equity in net loss of affiliates 
after giving effect to the reserve  the company s carrying value of its investment is zero

the remaining  is reserved for acquisitions by cinc 
of the   may be borrowed by cifc to be repaid to the parent company and used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions 
the cobank credit agreement restricts the ability of the company s affiliates and subsidiaries  a substantial number of which are consolidated for financial statement purposes  to make distributions to the parent company until such affiliates and subsidiaries have repaid all outstanding debt to cifc 
as a result  a portion of the company s consolidated cash flows and cash balances is not available to satisfy the parent company s capital and debt service requirements 
the company s budgeted capital requirements consist primarily of i parent company capital expenditures  working capital and debt service and ii the capital expenditures  working capital  other operating and debt service requirements of the affiliates
