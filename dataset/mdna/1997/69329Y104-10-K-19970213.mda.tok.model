item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to those discussed in risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this document 
overview since the company s founding in  a primary focus of its operations has been research and development 
achievement of successful research and development and commercialization of products derived from such efforts is subject to high levels of risk and significant resource commitments 
the company has a history of operating losses and expects to incur substantial additional expenses over at least the next few years  as it continues to develop its proprietary products and devote significant resources to preclinical studies  clinical trials  and manufacturing 
the company s revenues to date have consisted  and for the near future are expected to consist  principally of research and development funding  licensing and signing fees and milestone payments from pharmaceutical companies under collaborative research and development and licensing agreements 
these revenues may vary considerably from quarter to quarter and from year to year and revenues in any period may not be predictive of revenues in any subsequent period  and variations may be significant depending on the terms of the particular agreements 
in particular  revenues for the fourth quarter of  which included several non recurring payments in connection with new licensing agreements  may not be indicative of revenues in future quarters 
while the company historically has received significant revenue pursuant to certain of its research and development agreements  the company has recognized substantially all of the research and development and milestone revenue due under these collaborations 
although the company anticipates entering into new collaborations from time to time  the company presently does not anticipate realizing non royalty revenue from its new and proposed collaborations at levels commensurate with the non royalty revenue historically recognized under its older collaborations 
moreover  the company anticipates that its operating expenses will continue to increase significantly as the company increases its research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical activity  and administrative and patent activities 
accordingly  in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or licensing agreements  royalties on zenapax sales  if any  or other sources  the company expects to incur substantial and increased operating losses in the foreseeable future as certain of its earlier stage potential products move into later stage clinical development  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development  as the company invests in additional manufacturing facilities or capacity  as the company defends or prosecutes its patents and patent applications and as the company invests in research or acquires additional technologies or businesses 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of management s estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
for example  certain of the company s accrued liabilities with respect to clinical trials represent management s estimates of the timing and expenses associated with patient accrual and the termination or winding down of the company s clinical trials 
these estimates and assumptions could differ significantly from the amounts which may actually be realized 
nonrefundable signing or licensing fee payments that are not dependent on future performance under collaborative agreements are recognized as revenue when received 
payments for research and development performed by the company under contractual arrangements are recognized as revenue ratably over the quarter in which the payment is received and the related work is performed 
revenue from achievement of milestone events is recognized when the funding party agrees that the scientific or clinical results stipulated in the agreement have been met 
deferred revenue arises principally due to timing of cash payments received under research and development contracts 
results of operations years ended december   and the company s total revenues were million in as compared to million in and million in total research and development revenues represented million  million and million of total revenues in  and  respectively 
interest and other income were million in  million in  and million in the increase in total research and development revenues in over the prior years was primarily attributable to an increase in up front licensing and signing fees  and receipt of a milestone payment from boehringer mannheim in january increased funding during and from boehringer mannheim was partially offset by reduced funding from roche  whose funding arrangement ended in january reimbursement funding under the agreement with boehringer mannheim ended in october the company received million in up front licensing and signing fees in  compared to million and million in and respectively 
of the amounts spent by the company for research and development  million in  million in and million in represented third party funded research and development activities not including licensing fees  milestone payments and product sales 
interest and other income of million in was comparable to million in the increase in from million in was attributable primarily to higher cash and investment balances in resulting from the sale of stock to corange  an affiliate of boehringer mannheim  in december total costs and expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in costs and expenses in compared to and was due primarily to increases in research and development expenses in each of those periods 
research and development expenses in increased to million from million in and million in  primarily as a result of the company s conducting additional development efforts independently and under its agreements with its collaborative partner  boehringer mannheim 
these expenses included the addition of staff  the initiation and continuation of clinical trials  costs of conducting preclinical tests  expansion of pharmaceutical development capabilities including support for both clinical development and manufacturing process development  and higher costs in the expanded operation of the manufacturing facility 
general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in and million in these increases were primarily the result of increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support the company s expanding operations 
liquidity and capital resources to date the company has financed its operations primarily through public and private placements of equity  research and development revenue  capital lease financing and interest income on invested capital 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and investments in the aggregate of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  pursuant to the agreement with boehringer mannheim  the company may be required to reimburse boehringer mannheim up to million for phase ii studies and up to million for phase iii studies of ost in the event certain conditions are met 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in and million in the company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others  the progress of the company s product candidates in clinical trials  the continued or additional support by collaborative partners or other third parties of research and clinical trials  enhancement of research and development programs  the time required to gain regulatory approvals  the resources the company devotes to self funded products  manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  third party manufacturing commitments  the ability of the company to obtain and retain funding from third parties under collaborative agreements  the development of internal marketing and sales capabilities  the demand for the company s potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by the company  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect the company s proprietary technology 
in order to develop and commercialize its potential products the company may need to raise substantial additional funds following this offering through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing may only be available on terms dilutive to existing stockholders 
the company believes that existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs through
