the operating results of the acquired companies subsequent to the acquisition date are included in the consolidated statements of income 
details for the funding of the acquisition are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales and cost of sales 
net sales were billion in  compared with the record year of billion and the net sales of billion 
record shipments of  tons were an increase of over the previous record year of gross margin as a percent of sales was in  compared with in and in the lower margin was due to lower selling prices  coupled with less than full running conditions only partially offset by lower pulp costs and better productivity 
plant operations 
groundwood free coated shipments primarily wisconsin rapids and converting divisions decreased slightly about due to less than capacity operations mostly offset by continued productivity improvements on all machines 
during  the wisconsin rapids division  excluding the no 
paper machine  operated at of available capacity  compared with in and in the industry average capacity utilization was for groundwood free grades in  in and in the wisconsin rapids division s smallest machine no 
did not operate in the machine was idled in and has since only operated during the period of march through november on average  selling prices decreased in  following increases in late and early the converting division  which converts heavier weight groundwood free coated rolls into sheets  operated at of available capacity  compared with in and in although niagara division shipments are included for the full year of  groundwood coated shipments biron  wisconsin river and niagara declined due to less than capacity operations at all divisions 
the divisions operated at only of available capacity in biron and wisconsin river divisions operated at of available capacity in and in  while niagara operated at during the second half of the us industry average capacity utilization was for groundwood grades in  in and in during  selling prices declined  following an increase of in and a decline of in lake superior paper industries supercalendered groundwood paper operated at of available capacity in  compared with during weak markets during resulted in selling prices declining to late levels  reversing the increase in the stevens point division s coated specialty paper shipments declined in compared with this followed a decline in shipments for of and an increase for the record year operations were at of available capacity for  compared with in and in selling prices decreased  reversing price increases of implemented during the first half of paperboard products shipments increased and corrugated products shipments increased in the paperboard products and corrugated products businesses both operated in highly competitive markets and continued their marketing emphasis on producing high value added specialty products 
superior recycled fiber industries operated at of available capacity in  compared with in cost reductions for scrap paper during the fourth quarter of continued in  resulting in selling price reductions for recycled pulp during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in to million  compared with increases of million in and million in the larger than normal increase reflects a full year s costs for the july acquisition 
other income and income taxes 
other income expense was million in and million in  an improvement of million  compared with a decrease of million in and an improvement of million in included in the interest expense and interest income for is million and million  respectively  resulting from the sale and leaseback of two paper machines 
details are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the rate in is due to refinements in the allocation of taxable income into lower taxed states and some resolutions of long standing tax audits 
management s discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources current account changes 
the july acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the assets and liabilities  which have been stated at their fair value  affect the comparison to prior periods 
accounts receivable in decreased by million  compared with increases of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was principally due to lower selling prices and volume  a result of the weak paper market 
the days sales outstanding has not materially changed  and the company believes its collection period is well within the industry s standards 
inventories increased million compared with  with finished goods increasing million due to the company maintaining higher inventory levels to be more responsive to customer needs 
raw materials decreased million  primarily as a result of lower inventory levels  which were partially offset by a million increase in stores supplies 
the year end ratio of current assets to current liabilities was in and in and  with most of the increase resulting from no current maturity of long term debt at the end of capital commitments and spending 
at the end of  authorized but uncompleted capital commitments totaled million 
a capital approval budget of million is in place 
this million  plus the million carry over from  less anticipated carry over of million at the end of  will result in planned capital spending of million in  compared with expenditures of million in  million in and million in the major expenditures included million for a paper machine addition at the stevens point division  million for a new finishing winder at the biron division  million toward the third phase of a chlorine reduction program at the kraft division  and million for a new fiber handling system at the niagara division 
the capital approval budget for million consists of million for necessary replacement and quality projects  million for high return projects  and million for environmental control projects 
included in the approval budget is million for new projects for the operations acquired in long term debt 
the company s borrowings as of year end were million  an increase of million  following an increase of million in and a decrease of million in cash generated was not sufficient to fund the million capital spending program  and a million refinancing of a groundwood mill lease at the niagara division previously an off balance sheet operating lease 
current external financing assures adequate capital to fund existing and projected projects  and any future positive cash flow will be used to pay down debt 
interest incurred  excluding interest related to the sale and leaseback of two paper machines  totaled almost million in  with million charged against income and million capitalized as part of the cost of related capital projects 
substantially all of the machinery and equipment at lake superior paper industries are under operating leases 
the company has options under these leases to purchase the interests of the owner participants at set prices at various times during the leases and again at the conclusion of the leases for the then fair market value of the equipment 
if the company purchases the interests of the equity participants  the company would be required to assume related debt secured by the leased equipment 
under the lake superior paper industries leases  the company has options at the end of to buy out the equity participants for million and assume related debt of million 
the company expects that adequate financing will be available if these options are exercised 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company entered into sale and leaseback transactions for two paper machines during these leases are capital in nature  resulting in lease obligations of million at december  because deposits of million at december   are believed to be adequate for future lease payments  the company will not need to generate or borrow significant additional funds to make the required lease payments 
environmental matters 
the paper industry is subject to extensive environmental regulations  many of which require significant capital and operational expenditures 
the company recently completed a multiphase chlorine reduction program involving equipment and process changes at the kraft division 
this program is designed to ensure compliance with dioxin wastewater permit limitations and with wisconsin regulations requiring best available chloroform emission control technology 
mechanical pulp is bleached using a totally chlorine free process 
the clean air act amendments of and the clean water act effluent guidelines limitations are expected to have a significant financial impact on the paper industry 
the us environmental protection agency epa proposed rules to reduce the discharge of water pollutants and emissions of hazardous air pollutants from the pulp and paper industry 
these proposed regulations are commonly referred to as the cluster rule 
the company s review of the most recently proposed cluster rule indicates that additional capital expenditures of approximately million for process and equipment changes may be required three years after the cluster rule is final 
additional annual operating costs of approximately million also may be required 
the cluster rule is subject to further change prior to final promulgation  which is now expected in the spring of in march  the epa issued final water quality guidance for the great lakes system 
this guidance  known as the great lakes initiative gli  establishes a mechanism for dealing with toxic pollutants  which is to be followed by all great lakes states  and will be applicable to all of the company s manufacturing operations 
affected states have until march to adopt the provisions of the gli  which has been challenged in court by the paper industry and other impacted parties 
compliance with the gli may require additional capital expenditures and increased operating costs 
the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to several hazardous waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
while cercla provided for joint and several liability  remediation costs are generally allocated among waste generators and others involved with the site 
the company has accrued approximately million for its share of estimated cleanup costs at these sites 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted when appropriate 
the state of wisconsin has undertaken sediment remediation studies on various watershed systems  including the wisconsin river and the fox river 
also  the us department of the interior has notified several companies of its intent to pursue natural resource damage claims with respect to the fox river 
the company s appleton division  closed in  was on the fox river 
to date  the company has not been involved in any discussions concerning the fox river 
substantially all of the company s central wisconsin manufacturing operations use water from and discharge treated effluent into the wisconsin river 
the company does not know whether remedial actions will be undertaken with respect to the wisconsin river  but expects to be involved in ongoing studies of the wisconsin river system and in any sediment remediation activities on this system 
the company is engaged in lagoon closure activities and groundwater studies at its niagara facility 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements environmental matters 
management believes that the resolution of existing environmental matters will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations
