overview the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere herein 
allied life financial corporation is an insurance holding company formed by allied mutual insurance company allied mutual in july of the financial statements include the accounts of allied life insurance company allied life  allied life brokerage agency  inc alba  and allied group merchant banking corporation agmb 
allied life accounts for substantially all of the company s operations and sells primarily life insurance and annuity products 
allied life s universal life insurance products provide life insurance coverages with flexible premium payments determined by policyholders and accumulate cash value over the policy term 
premiums received less policy assessments for administration expenses and mortality costs are credited to policyholder account balances  to which tax deferred interest is credited at rates adjusted periodically by allied life 
surrender charges may be deducted from the account balances if policies are surrendered within a specified period after their effective dates 
term life insurance policies provide life insurance protection over a specified number of years 
policyholders remit premiums for the insurance protection but accumulate no cash value 
annuity contracts are products which provide for fixed or variable periodic benefit payments that commence according to contract terms and permit interest income to accumulate on a tax deferred basis 
considerations paid by policyholders are credited to their accounts and earn interest at rates determined by allied life 
to encourage policy persistency  surrender charges are imposed against account balances for early termination of annuity contracts 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  universal life insurance premiums received are shown as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for universal life products consist of fee income from mortality charges  administration expenses  and surrender charges assessed against the account balances 
surrender benefits paid are reflected as decreases in liabilities for these account balances and not as expenses 
interest credited to account balances is reported as benefit expenses in the financial statements 
premium revenues reported for term life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
benefits relating to these products are associated with earned premiums 
they are reported as benefit expenses by means of the change in the liabilities for future policy benefits so as to recognize profits over the premium paying periods of the policies 
annuity considerations received and surrender benefits paid are shown as increases and decreases to liabilities for policyholder account balances and are not shown as revenues or expenses 
revenues reported for annuity products consist of surrender charges deducted from policyholder accounts 
expenses consist of interest credited to account balances 
another source of revenues for allied life is investment income earned from the funds deposited to accounts by universal life and annuity policyholders  a portion of which is passed through to these policyholders in the form of interest credited 
the costs related to acquiring new business principally commissions  certain costs of issuing policies  and certain other variable selling expenses defined as deferred policy acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized into expense primarily in proportion to the present value of expected gross profits 
this amortization is adjusted when allied life revises its current or estimated future gross profits 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than expected and when investments are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect allied life s exposure to mortality risk 
they fluctuate from period to period according to the level of claims incurred under allied life s insurance retention limit 
profitability is primarily affected by investment spread the excess of investment income earned over the amounts credited as interest to policyholder accounts  mortality experience difference between actual and expected death and other policyholder benefits  and the ability to control policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
because of allied life s relatively small size  its operating results may be affected significantly by the level of death and other policyholder benefits incurred in any one reporting period 
the tables on pages and reflects allied life s production information and pretax operating results excluding realized investment gains losses and related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the years indicated 
the following analysis of life insurance operations should be read with reference to the table 
results of operations compared with consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  a increase over the million reported for the increase was attributable to life insurance premiums and other insurance income net of reinsurance premiums ceded that rose due to increased sales of term life insurance 
in the company had realized gains on investments of  as compared with realized losses of  in consolidated revenues have grown at a slower rate over the last several quarters due to lower sales of universal life and annuity products 
investment income and policyholder assessments on universal life have shown decreases in growth primarily because of lower increases in invested assets and universal life account balances

universal life account balances increased at year end from year end fee income increased to million from million 
the savings element of universal life products has become less attractive over the last several years due to generally lower interest rates and an increasing equity market 
the face amount of new term life insurance sold directly by agents increased to billion for from billion for sales of term insurance with and year guaranteed rates were strong 
first year annuity premiums decreased to million from million for the decrease was due to lower sales in the first and second quarter 
the lower sales were caused by a flat interest yield curve  which allowed banks and other financial institutions to offer short term certificates of deposit at more competitive interest rates 
interest rates rose during the middle of the year  and sales reached expected levels in the third and fourth quarters 
the total annuity account balance increased to million at year end from million at year end adjusted insurance revenues increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to increased investment spread and other insurance income due to term life insurance sales 
the growth in life insurance in force and policyholder account balances permitted invested assets at cost to increase to million at december  from million at december  investment income increased by 
allied life s return on invested assets decreased to in from in investment spread grew to million from million 
annual average interest credited rates on universal life contracts decreased to from and on annuities decreased to from 
the ratio of investment spread to investment income decreased only slightly to from despite the volatile interest rate environment during this is evidence of allied life s ability to adjust interest credited to policyholder accounts to reflect trends in investment earnings 
death benefits net of reinsurance remained at million 
other policyholder benefits decreased to million from million as decreases in reserves for supplemental contracts and single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies more than offset the increase in reserves on new term life sales and policyholder bonus reserves on universal life products 
other insurance operating expenses increased to million from million 
additional charge to dpac amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dpac was million in included in that amount was an additional charge taken by the company of million as the result of its annual dpac study that suggested refinements in assumptions concerning future annuity policy persistency and interest rate spreads were necessary 
annuity dpac reflects the deferred costs primarily commissions associated with sales 
these expenses are amortized in proportion to the actual profits and estimated future profits of a given block of annuity policies 
estimated future profits and amortization of costs are reviewed annually for universal life insurance and annuity products and may be reviewed more frequently if circumstances dictate 
gaap requires that the estimated future profits and future amortization be recomputed based on actual experience and updated expectations of future experience unlocking 
this unlocking may result in both adjustments related to prior amortization as well as changes to ongoing amortization rates 
while the company will continue to re evaluate the dpac assumptions  it does not anticipate making additional material adjustments to dpac amortization schedules in the foreseeable future 
further adjustments would be necessary only if actual experience should differ significantly from the assumptions used in the dpac study models 
dpac amortization was million in primarily due to the additional charge of million  operating income before taxes decreased to million in from million in results of operations compared with consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase over the million reported for the increase was primarily attributable to higher investment income  which rose to million from million  and policyholder assessments on universal life contracts  which increased to million from million 
these increases resulted from the growth in invested assets and policyholder account balances during the year 
policyholder account balances increased primarily as a result of policy retention and premiums and considerations received from universal life and annuity products

the face amount of new life insurance sold directly by agents in decreased to billion from billion in the primary factor was a decrease in the face amount of new universal life insurance sold to million from million 
this decrease was partially due to the discontinuance of the champion product on january  lower market interest rate levels also affected sales 
policyholder account balances  however  were up  and fee income increased to million from million

the total annuity account balance increased to million at year end from million at year end adjusted insurance revenues increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to increased investment spread  greater fee income  and other insurance income 
the growth in life insurance in force and policyholder account balances permitted invested assets at cost to increase to million at december   from million at december   allowing investment income to increase by

the ratio of investment spread to investment income decreased only slightly to from despite the volatile interest rate environment during amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased to million from million because of allied life s increase in profitability 
other insurance operating expenses increased to million from million  a result of overall growth 
death benefits net of reinsurance increased to million from million 
other policyholder benefits increased to million from million as a result of increased reserves on new term life sales and supplemental contracts and an increase in policyholder bonus reserves on universal life products 
allied life s operating income before taxes was up to million from million in the increase occurred because the improved investment spread and increased fee income more than offset the higher expenses and policyholder benefits 
liquidity and capital resources allied life financial corporation as an insurance holding company  alfc relies on dividends from allied life to make dividend payments to its preferred and common stockholders 
the ability of allied life to pay dividends to the company is limited by law to earned profits unassigned surplus as of the dates dividends are paid 
such ability is determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities of the state of iowa 
the iowa insurance holding company act precludes allied life s payment of an extraordinary dividend without prior notice to and approval of the iowa insurance commissioner 
an extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution of cash or other property whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the greater of i of statutory policyholders surplus total capital stock and surplus as of december of the preceding year or ii the net gain from operations on a statutory basis for the twelve month period ending december of the preceding year 
during  the maximum amount available for distribution to the company from allied life without special regulatory approval of or notification to the iowa insurance commissioner is approximately million 
a source of cash flows for alfc is dividend payments from allied life 
during  the company paid cash dividends of million to common and preferred stockholders 
allied life paid to the company dividends of million primarily to fund the company s dividend requirement 
annual dividends payable on the currently outstanding series preferred stock are approximately million 
in accordance with the terms of the series preferred stock  the company may pay dividends thereon by issuing additional shares of such stock for any quarter ending on or prior to september  in  the company paid dividends in the form of  shares of series preferred stock 
effective august   the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire shares of the company common stock on the open market 
the company completed the program during the third quarter of  repurchasing and cancelling  shares at an average cost of per share 
consolidated life insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow from operations 
its adequacy is measured by liquidity 
there should be sufficient cash to meet benefit obligations to policyholders and normal operating expenses as they are incurred and sufficient excess to help meet future policy benefit payments and to write new business 
allied life s liquidity position continued to be favorable in  with cash inflows at levels sufficient to provide the funds necessary to meet obligations 
the company s cash inflows consist primarily of deposits to policyholder account balances  proceeds from sales  maturities and calls of investments  and repayments of investment principal 
the company s cash outflows primarily are related to policyholder account withdrawals  investment purchases  policy acquisition costs  policyholder benefits  and current operating expenses 
these outflows are typically met from normal annual premium and net investment cash inflows 
company operations provided cash inflows of million in  million in  and million in cash inflows from financing activities amounted to million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
these funds and the excess operating inflows were used primarily to increase the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio 
matching the investment portfolio maturities to the cash flow demands of the insurance coverages being provided is an important consideration 
the company continually monitors benefit and claims statistics to project future cash requirements 
as part of this monitoring process  the company performs cash flow testing of its assets and liabilities under various scenarios to evaluate the adequacy of reserves 
in developing its investment strategy  the company establishes a level of cash and securities that when combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments  principal payments on amortizing securities  and its insurance products is believed to be adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations 
as of december   of the company s investments were in fixed maturities 
the investment policy for allied life requires that the fixed maturity portfolio be invested primarily in debt obligations rated bbb or higher when they are acquired 
of the company s fixed maturity investments held at year end  were rated a or better  were rated below investment grade below bbb 
the carrying values of all the company s investments in fixed maturities are reviewed on an ongoing basis for credit deterioration 
if review indicates a decline in fair value below cost that is other than temporary  the company s carrying value in the investment is reduced to its estimated realizable value and a corresponding write down is taken 
such reductions in carrying value are recognized as realized losses and charged to income 
no reductions in carrying value were recognized for the year ended december  the company s fixed maturity portfolio includes collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
cmos consist of pools of mortgages divided into tranches that provide sequential retirement of bonds 
to provide call protection and more stable average lives  the company invests primarily in planned amortization classes pacs and sequential pay bonds that generally provide more predictable cash flows within a range of prepayment speeds by shifting some of the prepayment risks to support tranches 
at year end  all of the company s cmos were investment grade securities 
they had a carrying value of million and a fair value of million  of these investments were in pac and sequential pay bonds 
all of the company s cmo investments have an active secondary market  therefore  their effect on liquidity is not expected to differ from the effect of other fixed maturity investments 
the company has a line of credit agreement with the federal home loan bank that provides additional liquidity 
the agreement makes million available through march  interest is payable at the current rate upon issuance 
from time to time  the company has borrowed funds from its affiliates on an arms length basis 
at december   the company had an outstanding borrowing of million under the line of credit agreement 
during  the company entered into a note payable agreement with allied mutual  an affiliate 
the outstanding borrowing at december  was approximately million 
management anticipates that funds to meet the company s short term and long term capital expenditures  cash dividends  and operating cash needs will come from existing capital and internally generated funds 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
as additional capital needs arise  the company will consider taking on additional debt or issuing equity 
specific methods for meeting such needs will depend upon financial market conditions at the time 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on consolidated results of operations 
to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations  management attempts to invest new funds in securities with expected durations that match related policyholder obligations 
as a rule  the fair value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates while investment income moves in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decrease  the company s fixed maturity investments generally will increase in value 
investment income  on the other hand  will decrease as fixed maturity investments mature or are sold and the proceeds are reinvested at the lower interest rates 
interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of the universal life and annuity products offered by allied life 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments may become more attractive to potential purchasers until the interest rates credited to policyholder account balances are increased 
if interest rates fall  profitability will be affected negatively until credited rates are adjusted to compensate for the decline in investment income 
allied life sells universal life and annuity contracts that generally permit flexible responses to interest rates  which are monitored constantly 
hedging activities in june  the company began interest rate hedging programs whereby certain derivative financial instruments including cash settle put swaptions swaptions and interest rate floors floors were purchased 
swaptions are being purchased to reduce the negative effect of increased withdrawal activity related to the company s annuity liabilities that may result from extreme increases in interest rates 
as of december   the company was party to agreements for these instruments 
the agreements expire quarterly from june through march they entitle the company to receive payments from the instrument s counter parties on future reset dates if the interest rate which is directly tied to the year constant maturity swap curve on any expiration date is above a specified fixed rate to for instruments entered into as of december  
the notional amounts range from million to million total of million 
floors are being purchased to reduce the negative effect that may result from extreme decreases in interest rates to a level below the guaranteed interest rates provided for in the universal life insurance contracts 
the agreements for the floors outstanding as of december  expire quarterly from june through march they entitle the company to receive payments from the instrument s counter parties on future reset dates if the interest rate which is tied directly to the year constant maturity treasury curve on the expiration date is below a specified fixed rate for instruments entered into as of december  
the notional amounts for each quarter range from million to million 
the costs of the interest rate hedging programs are not expected to have a material impact on the interest rate margin 
for both swaptions and floors  the company pays only the original premium and is not at risk of further payments regardless of market conditions 
the company does not anticipate making any further purchases of interest rate hedges in the near future 
premiums paid to purchase these instruments are capitalized and included in other invested assets 
through december   the company had paid approximately million in premiums 
premiums are amortized into income over the term of the instruments on a straight line basis 
gains and losses on these instruments and related assets are not recorded in income until realized 
at the beginning of the second quarter of  the company introduced an equity indexed annuity product that guarantees customers the return of principal 
interest credited is based on a percentage of the gain of the s p index r 
a portion of the premium from each customer is invested in investment grade fixed income securities to cover the minimum guaranteed value due the customer at the end of the term 
a portion of the premium is used to purchase s p call options call options to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the s p index r 
the call options provide the company the opportunity to participate in the increases of the s p index r if the market advances 
at december   the company had purchased call options with notional amounts between  and  total of million 
premiums paid to purchase call options are capitalized and included in other assets 
through december   the company had paid approximately million in premiums 
premiums are amortized as an expense over the term of the instruments on a straight line basis 
gains and losses on these instruments and related liabilities are not recorded in income until realized 
the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission sec are evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements for hedging activities and derivative financial instruments 
as a result of these deliberations  the company s accounting treatment may change in the future 
the company is actively monitoring the proposals that are in various stages of discussion  the impact of the final standards cannot be clearly projected at this time 
the company is exposed to the risk of losses in the event of nonperformance of the counter parties of the above swaptions  floors  and call options 
losses recorded in the company s financial statements in the event of non performance will be limited to the unamortized premium paid to enter into the instruments 
economic losses will be measured by the net replacement cost of such instruments or by their fair value if the net fair value is in the company s favor 
the company limits its exposure to such losses by diversification among reputable counter parties with appropriate credit ratings 
emerging regulatory issues the company s insurance subsidiary is subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which it is admitted to transact business 
state insurance laws generally establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers related to granting and revoking licenses to transact business  establishing guaranty fund associations  licensing agents  approving policy forms  regulating premium rates for some lines of business  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted 
recently  the insurance regulatory framework has received increased scrutiny from various states  the federal government  and the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
the naic has recommended to the states for adoption and implementation several regulatory initiatives 
iowa as well as three other states have adopted the naic regulation for life insurance policy sales illustrations 
additional states are expected to adopt the new regulation in the effect of any adoption by individual states is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s insurance production 
new accounting standards in the company adopted sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
management determined the adoption had no impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in  the company adopted sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans  but permits continued application of the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  in determining compensation expense related to stock based compensation 
companies that continue to apply opinion must nonetheless comply with the new disclosure requirements of sfas the company elected to continue to account for stock based compensation under the provisions of opinion and its related interpretations 
this adoption had no impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in june of  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier or retroactive application of this statement is not permitted 
the company will adopt sfas on january  management has determined that the implementation will not have a material effect on its financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity
