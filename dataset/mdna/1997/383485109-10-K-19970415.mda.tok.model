these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings under the company s various lines of credit in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  which resulted from i a decrease in libor during the period  ii a higher percentage of borrowings outstanding under more cost effective financing arrangements  including the line of credit with bank hapoalim and the securitization program  and iii a lower interest rate applicable to the new line of credit agreement with congress financial corporation congress  entered into in december  which replaced the fleet facility

per share in fiscal as compared to net income of 
per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
as described more fully below  the company s working capital requirements are currently met through a combination of cash provided by operations  borrowings under its revolving lines of credit and its securitization program 
the company s liquidity improved as compared to the prior year as a result of improved operating results and its new revolving line of credit agreement 
revolving lines of credit 
on december   the company entered into a new three and one quarter year revolving line of credit arrangement with congress financial corporation congress 
the new line of credit with congress replaced the company s former line of credit agreement with fleet capital corporation fleet and provides the company with an million working capital facility through march  borrowings under the arrangement are limited to a restrictive borrowing base equal to of eligible merchandise inventories  increasing to of such inventories during the period of september through december of each year to fund increased seasonal inventory requirements 
interest under the facility is charged at a rate of approximately libor plus at february   with the potential to reduce the interest rate by each year  up to a maximum possible reduction of beginning in fiscal  if specified pre tax income levels are attained by the company 
initial proceeds from the arrangement were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the line of credit with fleet 
the maximum amount available for borrowings under the line of credit with congress was million as of february   of which million was outstanding as of that date 
of that amount  million has been classified as long term in the accompanying financial statements as the company does not anticipate repaying that amount prior to one year from the balance sheet date 
the agreement contains one financial covenant  pertaining to the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth  with which the company was in compliance as of february  the company s former facility with fleet provided the company with a million working capital facility  limited to a restrictive borrowing base equal to of eligible merchandise inventories  increasing to during certain periods for increased seasonal requirements 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the fleet facility was charged at a rate of libor plus  and the arrangement contained numerous restrictive financial covenants 
management believes the company s improved operating results enabled the company to obtain the more favorable financing arrangement with congress  which provides the company with increased borrowing capacity at a lower interest rate  and greater flexibility due to the elimination of all but one restrictive financial covenant 
in addition to the congress facility  the company also has a revolving line of credit with bank hapoalim that provides for additional borrowings of up to million through march the company s borrowing capacity under the line of credit with bank hapoalim is limited to a percentage of the outstanding balance of receivables collateralizing the line  and is therefore subject to seasonal variations that may affect the outstanding balance of such receivables 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the line of credit is charged at a rate equal to libor plus at february  
at february   million was outstanding under the line of credit with bank hapoalim  which was the maximum amount available for borrowings as of that date 
as described more fully in the cash flows from securitization program portion of this section  the issuance of an additional million fixed base certificate in fiscal reduced the level of receivables available to collateralize the variable base certificate  and thus has reduced the company s borrowing capacity under the facility in the near term 
other financings 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has four fifteen year mortgage loans with midland commercial funding midland with outstanding balances totaling million at february  the midland loans  due  bear interest at rates ranging from to 
the company also has the following other long term loan facilities as of february  i a mortgage loan payable with heller financial  inc heller due  with an outstanding loan balance of million  an additional mortgage loan payable for million with heller  due march  bearing interest at a fixed rate of  iii two five year notes payable to federated department stores  inc  due  with outstanding balances totaling million  and iv other long term obligations with outstanding balances totaling million 
all of the company owned stores have either been mortgaged or sold and leased back to the company  leaving the company with limited capacity for future additional long term secured borrowing 
cash flows from securitization program 
the company s receivables securitization program provides the company with an additional source of working capital financing that is generally more cost effective than traditional debt financing 
accordingly  the company continually seeks to divert as large a percentage of total borrowings as possible to its securitization program 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  million principal amount fixed base class a credit card certificates were issued in under the receivables securitization program the fixed base certificates 
on october   an additional million principal amount fixed base certificate the fixed base certificate was issued under the program 
proceeds from the issuance of the fixed base certificate were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the line of credit with bank hapoalim and pay certain costs associated with the transaction 
interest on the and fixed base certificates collectively the fixed base certificates is earned by the certificate holders on a monthly basis and is paid through finance charges collected under the program 
the outstanding principal balance of the certificates are to be repaid in equal monthly installments commencing september through september  through the application of credit card receivable principal collections during that period 
the issuances of the fixed base certificates have been accounted for as sales for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the million of receivables underlying those certificates and the corresponding debt obligations have been excluded from the accompanying financial statements 
in  a variable base class a credit card certificate variable base certificate in the principal amount of up to million was also issued to bank hapoalim as collateral for the previously described revolving line of credit financing arrangement with that bank 
in addition to the fixed and variable base certificates  additional series of certificates may be issued as a source of additional working capital financing to the company 
management does not currently anticipate any additional certificate issuances in fiscal management believes the previously described sources of liquidity are adequate to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for fiscal management also believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity for its long term growth plans at moderate levels 
the company may engage in other financing activities if it is deemed to be advantageous 
additional cash flow and working capital analysis 
working capital increased by million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to as of the end of fiscal as compared to as of the end of fiscal the increases from fiscal to are primarily due to the reclassification of million of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit with congress to long term in the accompanying financial statements 
cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash income and expense items  including  but not limited to  depreciation and amortization  the provision for uncollectible accounts and changes in deferred taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to i improved operating results  ii the payment of approximately million of operating expenses related to fiscal during the rd week of fiscal as a result of the fiscal calendar shift  iii the receipt of million in connection with the filing of certain amended income tax returns  and iv lower costs associated with new store openings 
these increases were partially offset by cash used to fund an increase in merchandise inventories  resulting from the earlier receipt of certain spring merchandise in fiscal as compared to fiscal  a decrease in trade accounts payable and cash paid to settle previously pending litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in each of those years consisted primarily of expenditures for tenant improvements  construction costs and furniture  fixtures and equipment associated with new and certain existing store locations  less reimbursements received for certain of those expenditures 
such expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from various sale and sale leaseback arrangements during those periods 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal proceeds from financing arrangements finalized during fiscal  including the million received from the issuance of the fixed base certificate and the combined total of million received from the previously described heller and federated loans  were more than fully offset by principal payments made on various short term and long term obligations during the year 
increased cash flows from operating activities enabled the company to reduce net borrowings under its lines of credit during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal consisted primarily of net borrowings under the company s lines of credit 
the million provided by the midland financing was fully applied against previously outstanding obligations 
the company has entered into agreements to open two new department stores in fiscal  to be located in the current macy s location in santa rosa  california and the current k mart location in sonora  california 
the company has also commenced the remodel and  square foot expansion of its existing store located in the valley plaza mall in bakersfield  california 
the estimated cost to complete these projects  consisting primarily of tenant improvements  fixtures and equipment  net of amounts to be contributed by a mall owner  is million 
management expects to complete these projects during the second half of fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that the completion of such projects will not be delayed subject to a variety of conditions precedent or other factors 
inflation although inflation has not been a material factor to the company s operations during the past several years  the company does experience some increases in the cost of certain of its merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increase by adjusting its selling prices or modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company accounts for its merchandise inventories on the retail method using last in  first out lifo cost using the department store price indexes published by the bureau of labor statistics 
under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation in reported income due to increasing costs 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating results realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels
