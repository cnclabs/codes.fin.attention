the increase in product purchases corresponds to the increase in third party product sales 
combined product purchases as a percentage of residue gas  ngl and electric power sales increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the increased product purchase percentage is a continuing trend based upon the growth of third party sales  which typically have lower margins than sales of the company s equity production 
until recently  the company had experienced narrowing margins related to third party sales due to the increasing availability of pricing information in the natural gas industry 
the company believes  by targeting end use markets  these margins will continue to stabilize 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to expand its current end use business 
selling and administrative expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to  primarily as a result of growth in the company s marketing operations and higher benefit costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year

in addition  the company recorded a million write down of certain oil and gas assets and plant facilities in the fourth quarter of in connection with its adoption of sfas no 
the lower asset values contributed to the reduction in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for the year ended december  these decreases were offset by increases related to various property additions

and a million  after tax  restructuring charge the company recorded in may relating to its cost reduction program 
in addition  net income loss was adversely affected by higher product purchase costs associated with the company s third party residue gas sales and increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and interest expense  partially offset by higher residue gas volumes sold and higher ngl prices 
revenues from the sale of residue gas increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average gas sales volumes increased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to  largely due to an increase of approximately mmcf per day in the sale of residue gas purchased from third parties

per gallon to 
per gallon for the year ended december  compared to processing  transportation and storage revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million of the increase was due to greater ngl revenues from the company s giddings system and increased treating revenue  primarily from gathering systems acquired in december the remaining increase was primarily due to a long term firm storage and transportation agreement at the katy facility that the company entered into in february other net revenue decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the difference was primarily attributable to a million insurance recovery recorded in for business losses associated with the december fire at the company s granger facility 
the increase in product purchases corresponds to the increase in third party residue gas sales 
combined product purchases as a percentage of residue gas and ngl sales increased three percentage points to for the year ended december  compared to the rising residue gas purchase percentage is a continuing trend based upon the growth of third party sales  which typically have lower margins than sales of the company s equity production 
until recently  the company had experienced narrowing margins related to third party sales due to the increasing availability of pricing information in the natural gas industry 
the company believes by targeting end use markets  these margins will be stabilized 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in capturing these markets 
plant operating expense increased million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to assets purchased in the oasis acquisition in december  primarily for property taxes  and taxes on higher levels of inventory held at the katy facility  partially offset by cost savings resulting from the cost reduction plan initiated in may selling and administrative expense decreased million  primarily due to the cost reduction plan implemented in may depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to the oasis assets  additional depreciation  depletion and amortization related to the company s oil and gas production and various plant upgrades and equipment additions in interest expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to  due to an increase in the company s average borrowing rate from to per annum and higher average debt outstanding during  primarily due to the redemption of its cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under its financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet its needs and finance the growth of the company s business 
the company can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and it may be required to seek alternative financing sources 
net cash provided by operating activities is primarily affected by product prices and sales of inventory  the company s success in increasing the number and efficiency of its facilities and the volumes of natural gas processed by such facilities  as well as the margin on third party product purchased for resale 
the company s continued growth will be dependent upon success in the areas of marketing  additions to dedicated plant reserves  acquisitions and new project development 
the company believes that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with cash provided by operating activities  will provide it with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain its existing facilities and complete its current capital expenditure program 
depending on the timing and the amount of the company s future projects  it may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
the company s ability to secure such capital is restricted by its credit facilities  although it may request additional borrowing capacity from its lenders  seek waivers from its lenders to permit it to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement credit facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for an acquisition  sell existing assets or a combination of such alternatives 
while the company believes that it would be able to secure additional financing  if required  no assurance can be given that it will be able to do so or as to the terms of any such financing 
the company also believes that cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements in the company s sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows s sources of funds borrowings under revolving credit facility  net cash provided by operating activities  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  other  total sources of funds  uses of funds payments on revolving credit facility  payments on long term debt  capital investments  dividends paid  total uses of funds  additional sources of liquidity available to the company are volumes of residue gas and ngls in storage facilities 
the company stores residue gas and ngls primarily to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and for resale during periods when prices are favorable 
the company held approximately bcf of residue gas in storage for such purposes at an average cost of per mcf at december  compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december   primarily at the katy facility 
at december   the company had hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales for approximately bcf of stored gas at a weighted average price of per mcf for the stored inventory 
the company held ngls in storage of  mgal at an average cost of 
per gallon and  mgal at an average cost of 
per gallon at december  and december   respectively  at various third party storage facilities 
at december   the company did not have any hedging contracts in place associated with ngls in storage 
the company has been successful overall in replacing production with new reserves 
historically  the company has connected additional reserves that more than offset production from reserves dedicated to existing facilities 
however  certain individual plants have experienced declines in dedicated reserves 
in  including the reserves associated with the company s joint ventures  the company connected new reserves to its gathering systems to replace approximately of production 
on a company wide basis  dedicated reserves  including revisions to previous estimates  increased from approximately tcf as of december  to approximately tcf at december  the company has effective shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission for an aggregate of million of debt securities and preferred stock along with the shares of common stock  if any  into which such securities are convertible and million of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
in november  the company issued  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to the company of million were primarily used to reduce indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
risk management activities the company s commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of the company s equity volumes of natural gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow  net income and earnings per share in relation to those anticipated by the company s operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to the company s physical natural gas  ngl and power marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to hedging fixed price purchase and sale commitments  preserving the value of storage inventories  reducing exposure to physical market price volatility and providing risk management services to a variety of customers 
the company utilizes a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter otc market 
these instruments allow the company to preserve value and protect margins because gains or losses in the physical market are offset by corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments 
the company uses futures  swaps and options to reduce price risk and basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
the company enters into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and the kansas city board of trade and through otc swaps and options with creditworthy counterparties consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
the company conducts its standard credit review of otc counterparties and has agreements with such parties that contain collateral requirements 
the company generally uses standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
the company s otc credit risk exposure is partially limited by its ability to require a margin deposit based upon the mark to market value of the counterparties net exposure 
the company is subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements 
in addition  the company is subject to similar margin deposit requirements for its nymex counterparties related to its net exposures 
the use of financial instruments may expose the company to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i equity volumes are less than expected  ii the company s customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii the company s otc counterparties fail to perform 
to the extent that the company engages in hedging activities  it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  it is similarly insulated against decreases in such prices 
as of december   the company held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to october with an average portfolio life of approximately four months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf long and bcf short of futures  swaps and options 
as of december   the company held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with an average portfolio life of approximately five months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal long and  mgal short of futures  swaps and options

this was comprised of approximately bcf long and bcf short of futures  swaps and options 
as of december   the company had no futures  swaps or options positions outstanding related to ngls or electricity 
the company has hedged a portion of its equity volumes of residue gas and ngls in  particularly in the first quarter  at pricing levels in excess of its operating budget 
the company s hedging strategy establishes a minimum and maximum price to the company while allowing market participation between these levels 
as of march   the company had hedged approximately of its equity gas for at a weighted average nymex equivalent minimum price of per mcf  including approximately of first quarter equity volumes at a weighted average nymex equivalent minimum price of per mcf 
additionally  the company has hedged approximately of its equity ngls for at a weighted average composite mont belvieu and west texas intermediate crude equivalent minimum price of 
per gallon  including approximately of first quarter equity volumes at a weighted average composite mont belvieu and west texas intermediate crude equivalent minimum price of 
per gallon 
at december   the company had million of losses deferred in inventory that will be recognized primarily during the first quarter of and are expected to be offset by margins from the company s related forward fixed price hedges and physical sales 
at december   the company had unrecognized net losses of million related to financial instruments that are expected to be offset by corresponding unrecognized net gains from the company s obligations to sell physical quantities of natural gas  ngls and electric power 
during  the company began to enter into physical residue gas transactions payable in canadian dollars 
in order to insulate the company from adverse changes in currency exchange rates between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar  it has entered into foreign currency hedging transactions 
as of december   the notional value of such contracts was immaterial and there were no gains or losses associated with such transactions for the year ended december  the company enters into speculative futures  swap and option trades on a very limited basis for purposes that include testing of hedging techniques 
the company s procedures contain strict guidelines for such trading including predetermined stop loss requirements and net open positions limits 
speculative futures  swap and option positions are marked to market at the end of each accounting period and any gain or loss is recognized in income for that period 
net gains from such speculative activities for the years ended december  and were not material

the dividends declared in the fourth quarter of and paid in were excluded  per the agreement  from this calculation 
at december   million was available under this limitation  which is sufficient to pay required preferred stock dividends in the company generally utilizes excess daily funds to reduce any outstanding revolving credit balances and associated interest expense and it intends to continue such practice 
net proceeds from the november offering of  shares of common stock were used to reduce indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
at december   the company had a cash balance of million 
this cash balance is considered temporary as the cash will be used as the company commences its capital expenditure program 
master shelf agreement

covenant compliance 
at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants in its loan agreements 
interest rate swap agreements 
historically  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to changes in interest rates 
the transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest payment obligations or the exchange of foreign and us currencies  without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the net effect of interest rate swap activity is reflected as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
any gains on termination of interest rate swap agreements and the effects of foreign currency positions that were marked to market are included in other income 
at december  and  there were no such outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
in addition to the financial risk  which will vary during the life of swap agreements in relation to the maturity of the underlying debt and market interest rates  the company is subject to credit risk exposure from nonperformance of the counterparties to the swap agreements

at the time the company terminated the interest rate lock  interest rates had decreased  which resulted in the realization of a  loss 
the company considered the loss to be a cost of obtaining the privately placed debt and is therefore amortizing it over the ten year term of the senior notes 
environmental the construction and operation of the company s gathering lines  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  transporting  processing  treating or storing of residue gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at the company s facilities or at facilities to which the company sends wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or waste management 
the company employs seven environmental engineers to monitor environmental compliance and potential liabilities at its facilities 
prior to consummating any major acquisition  the company s environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
in addition  on an ongoing basis  the environmental engineers perform systematic environmental assessments of the company s existing facilities 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  constructing and operating the company s facilities 
the company believes that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have not had and will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company anticipates that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter standards 
the company is unaware of future environmental standards that are reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but it cannot rule out that possibility 
the company is in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at facilities that it operates 
in addition  the former owner of certain facilities that the company acquired in is conducting remediation at those facilities pursuant to contractual obligations 
the company s expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been significant in relation to the results of operations of the company and totaled approximately million for the year ended december   including approximately  in air emissions fees paid to the states in which it operates

expand energy marketing services and volumes prior to deregulation of the natural gas industry  the company s marketing activities were directed towards selling residue gas and ngls processed at its plants to ensure their efficient operation 
as the natural gas industry deregulated and new market opportunities developed  the company began to increase its third party marketing 
in order to compete in today s energy marketplace  a marketer must provide a full range of services and products to meet its customers demands 
the company is a full service marketer of residue gas and ngl products and has now expanded into the sale of electric power 
the company focuses on the individual needs of its customers and is committed to developing products and services that are tailored to meet their requirements 
the company plans to expand its energy marketing activities by i pursuing higher margin  end use markets  ii increasing third party gas  ngl and electric power sales volumes  and iii engaging in retail electric power sales as those markets become available through deregulation 
the company believes it competes effectively with other marketers due to its national marketing presence and the marketing information gained thereby  the services it provides and its physical asset base 
optimize profitability the company seeks to optimize the profitability of its operations by i maintaining or increasing natural gas throughput levels  ii increasing its efficiency through the consolidation of existing facilities  iii investing in assets that enhance product value  iv selling non strategic assets  and v controlling operating and overhead expenses
