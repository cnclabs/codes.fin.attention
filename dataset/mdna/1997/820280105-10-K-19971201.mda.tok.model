these acquisition related costs are included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended august  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements

the decrease in the fiscal rates from fiscal was primarily due to state income tax incentives and refunds 
the majority of these incentives and refunds will not be recurring  however  the increase in state income taxes should be partially offset by additional tax savings from foreign sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased million  or  for fiscal to million from million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to increased sales for projects in the domestic chemical and refinery sectors and the international power sector  as well as to the acquisitions of word and app  which contributed approximately million and million  respectively  in sales from their respective dates of acquisition

the gross margin for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease is attributable primarily to the decreased margins generated by naptech for fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  during fiscal  the company had a substantial decrease in sales and gross profits from the company s venezuelan facility  which historically had achieved higher gross margin percentages than the company s domestic subsidiaries 
these factors contributing to the decline in gross margins were partially offset by an increase in international projects with their generally higher profit margins  improvement in pricing in the domestic market and contributions from the app and word subsidiaries 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for the prior year 
the million increase was due primarily to the integration of word and app into shaw s business and to the variable costs associated with the increased sales 
interest expense for fiscal was million  up from the million incurred in fiscal  primarily due to increased borrowing resulting from the expansion of business  billing delays  and the acquisitions of app and word in beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company has benefitted from new loan and security agreements with commercial lenders and insurance companies  as well as an industrial revenue bond financing  that reduced overall interest rates applicable to the company and helped reduce the impact of the aforementioned increased borrowings 
the company s effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively
