variation in quarterly results the company has grown significantly through acquisitions  including the consummation of two mergers in with other publicly owned entities as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
these mergers were accounted for as poolings of interests and  accordingly  operating results for periods prior to these mergers  including quarterly results  have been restated

consequently  future quarterly results could be impacted by additional merger costs and related expenses associated with such merger and acquisition activity 
liquidity and capital resources the company operates in an industry that requires a high level of capital investment 
the company s capital requirements basically stem from i its working capital needs for its ongoing operations  ii capital expenditures for cell construction and expansion of its landfill sites  as well as new trucks and equipment for its collection operations  and iii business acquisitions 
the company s strategy is to meet these capital needs first from internally generated funds and secondly from various financing sources available to the company  including the incurrence of debt and the issuance of its common stock 
it is further part of the company s strategy to minimize working capital while maintaining available commitments under bank credit agreements to fund any capital needs in excess of internally generated cash flow 
as of december   the company had working capital of  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of and a cash balance of  which compares to working capital of  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of and a cash balance of  as of december  for the year ended december   net cash from operating activities was approximately  and net cash from financing activities was approximately  these funds were used primarily to fund investments in other businesses of  and for capital expenditures of approximately  the company s capital expenditure and working capital requirements have increased  reflecting the company s business strategy of growth through acquisitions and development projects 
the company intends to finance its capital expenditures through internally generated cash flow and amounts available under its revolving credit facility 
on august   in connection with the sanifill merger  the company replaced its  senior revolving credit facility with a  senior revolving credit facility credit facility and retired amounts under sanifill s credit facility 
the credit facility was used to refinance existing bank loans and letters of credit and to fund additional acquisitions and working capital 
the credit facility was available for standby letters of credit of up to  loans under the credit facility bore interest at a rate based on the eurodollar rate plus a spread not to exceed per annum spread set at per annum  or an applicable interest rate of per annum at december  
the credit facility required a facility fee not to exceed per annum on the entire available credit facility facility fee set at per annum at december  
the credit facility contained financial covenants with respect to interest rate coverage and debt capitalization ratios 
the credit facility also contained limitations on dividends  additional indebtedness  liens  and asset sales 
principal reductions were not required over the five year term of the credit facility 
on march   the credit facility was replaced with a  senior revolving credit facility with the same general terms  covenants  and limitations  which is available for standby letters of credit of up to on february   the company issued  of convertible subordinated notes  due on february  notes offering 
interest is payable semi annually in february and august 
the notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined 
the notes are redeemable after february  at the option of the company at of the principal amount  declining to of the principal amount on february  and thereafter until maturity  plus accrued interest 
deferred offering costs of approximately  were incurred and are being amortized ratably over the life of the notes 
the proceeds were used to repay debt under the company s credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
on february   concurrent with the notes offering  the company completed a public offering of  shares of its common stock  priced at per share 
the net proceeds of approximately  were primarily used to repay debt under the company s credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
on march   the company acquired all of the canadian solid waste subsidiaries of allied waste industries  inc  representing collection businesses  seven landfills  and eight transfer stations in the provinces of alberta  british columbia  manitoba  ontario  quebec  and saskatchewan  for approximately  in cash 
in connection with the transaction  the company s canadian subsidiary borrowed  as evidenced by a promissory note bearing interest at banker s acceptance plus 
the company currently intends to repay the  canadian borrowings with proceeds from its domestic credit facility prior to june  reducing the availability for this anticipated use  the company has approximately  available for additional cash borrowings under its credit facility as of march  on january   the company executed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of mid american waste systems  inc mid american for approximately  consisting primarily of cash and a limited amount of debt assumption 
the assets to be acquired include eleven collection businesses  eleven landfills  six transfer stations  and three recycling centers 
the acquisition has been approved by the bankruptcy court and is expected to close during the second quarter of on march   a canadian subsidiary of the company and wmx technologies  inc s waste management unit wmx jointly executed a letter of intent whereby the canadian subsidiary will acquire the majority of wmx s canadian solid waste businesses for approximately  including  in cash and  in company common stock 
the assets to be acquired include collection businesses  one landfill  and three transfer stations in the provinces of alberta  british columbia  ontario  and quebec  which generate approximately  in annualized operating revenues 
the acquisition  which is expected to close by may   is subject to regulatory approval and final negotiation and execution of a definitive sales agreement 
the company intends to fund the cash portions of the mid american and wmx canadian acquisitions from its existing credit facility 
the company s business plan is to grow through acquisitions as well as development projects 
the company has issued equity securities in business acquisitions and expects to do so in the future 
furthermore  the company s future growth will depend greatly upon its ability to raise additional capital 
the company continually reviews various financing alternatives and depending upon market conditions could pursue the sale of debt and or equity securities to help effectuate its business strategy 
management believes that it can arrange the necessary financing required to accomplish its business plan  however  to the extent the company is not successful in its future financing strategies the company s growth could be limited 
environmental matters the company also has material financial commitments for the costs associated with its future closure and post closure obligations with respect to the landfills it operates or for which it is otherwise responsible 
the company bases accruals for these commitments on periodic management reviews  typically performed at least annually  based on input from its engineers and interpretations of current regulatory requirements and proposed regulatory changes 
the accrual for closure and post closure costs includes final capping and cover for the site  methane gas control  leachate management and ground water monitoring  and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after each site discontinues accepting waste 
the company has estimated that the aggregate final closure and post closure costs will be approximately  as of december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of  and  respectively  for closure and post closure costs of disposal facilities 
the difference between the closure and post closure costs accrued at december   and the total estimated final closure and post closure costs to be incurred will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total estimated final closure and post closure to be incurred will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time the site stops accepting waste and is closed 
the company also expects to incur approximately  related to future capping activities during the remaining operating lives of the disposal sites  which are also being expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed 
management believes that the ultimate disposition of these environmental matters will not have a material  adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
however  the company s operation of landfills subjects it to certain operational  monitoring  site maintenance  closure and post closure obligations that could give rise to increased costs for monitoring and corrective measures 
the company cannot predict the effect of any regulations or legislation enacted in the future on the company s operations 
seasonality and inflation the company s operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months 
this is generally reflected in the company s first quarter operating results and may also be reflected in its fourth quarter operating results 
this is primarily attributable to the fact that i the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities tends to increase in the spring and summer months and ii the volume of waste relating to industrial and residential waste in certain regions where the company operates tends to decrease during the winter months 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have  any material adverse effect on the results of operations in the near future
