item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from the rendering of services and the sale or supply of computerized on line lottery systems and components to government authorized lotteries 
service revenues have been derived primarily from service contracts  that are typically of at least five years duration  and are generally based upon a percentage of a lottery s gross on line lottery sales 
these percentages typically fall within a range of to 
product sale revenues have been derived primarily from the installation of new on line lottery systems and sales of lottery terminals and equipment in connection with the expansion of existing lottery systems 
the size and timing of these transactions have resulted in variability in product sales revenues from period to period 
while the company believes that product purchases by lotteries during each of the next two years are likely to exceed the level experienced in fiscal  it is likely that the percentage of the company s revenues attributable to product sales will remain closer to the percentage level realized in fiscal than in fiscal the company has taken steps to broaden its offerings of high volume transaction processing services outside of its core business of providing on line lottery services 
the company s transactive subsidiary transactive provides services to governments to electronically distribute benefits  licenses  permits and information to constituents 
the company s dreamport subsidiary dreamport provides gaming technology and a comprehensive array of management  development and strategic services to the gaming and entertainment market 
in addition  the company s worldserv subsidiary worldserv specializes in the design  implementation and maintenance of sophisticated communications networks 
the company s business is highly regulated  and the competition to secure new government contracts is often intense 
awards of contracts to the company are  from time to time  challenged by competitors 
further  there have been and continue to be investigations of various types  including grand jury investigations  conducted by governmental authorities into possible improprieties and wrongdoing in connection with efforts to obtain and or the awarding of lottery contracts and related matters 
although the company does not believe that it has engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with these matters  certain investigations that are conducted largely in secret are still underway 
accordingly  the company lacks sufficient information to determine with certainty their ultimate scope and whether the government authorities will assert claims resulting from these or other investigations that could implicate or reflect adversely upon the company 
because the company s reputation for integrity is an important factor in its business dealings with lottery and other government agencies  if government authorities were to make an allegation of  or if there were to be a finding of  improper conduct on the part of or attributable to the company in any matter  such an allegation or finding could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including its ability to retain existing contracts and to obtain new or renewal contracts 
in addition  continuing adverse publicity resulting from these investigations and related matters could have such a material adverse effect

product sales for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  over the million of product sales in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from higher lottery terminal sales in fiscal than in fiscal  along with the sale of four new central systems in fiscal as compared to the sale of two new central systems in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower sales of component parts and equipment oem equipment to camelot group plc camelot and other members of the uk lottery consortium 
the company sold approximately  lottery terminals during fiscal  as compared to approximately  lottery terminals during fiscal gross margins on service revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to a small loss in fiscal at racimec relating to the start up nature of the on line lotteries serviced by racimec  along with lower margins experienced on new lottery contracts in the early stages of lottery operations 
also contributing to the reduction was a lack of significant large jackpot activity in the domestic lottery jurisdictions serviced by the company in fiscal  compared to a relatively high level of jackpot activity during fiscal the small loss incurred by racimec during fiscal was in line with management s expectations 
this represents a substantial improvement over results for fiscal and reflects the revenue enhancement and cost reduction plan implemented by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company believes that it will be able to recover racimec s investment in its existing brazilian state lottery contracts million at february  and is monitoring its progress closely 
in addition  in january  racimec signed a contract to provide  operate and maintain an on line lottery system for caixa economica federal caixa  latin america s largest financial institution that runs brazil s national lottery 
the caixa on line lottery system became operational in may also in line with management s expectations  transactive continued to incur operating losses during fiscal  although at a lower rate than in fiscal the reduction in operating losses reflects the successful implementation of the company s plan that  among other things  focused on reductions in operating costs 
the company is also considering alternatives to increase the value of transactive  including possibly joint venturing with another entity 
there can be no assurance that the company s plans and efforts with regard to transactive will continue to be successful  and if they are not  the company may be required to recognize a loss on a portion of its investment in transactive

gross margins on product sales fluctuate depending primarily on the mix  volume and timing of product sales contracts 
gross margins on product sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to a small loss incurred in connection with the sale of a central system in fiscal that was more than offset in fiscal as the company completed the shipment of terminals under the contract
