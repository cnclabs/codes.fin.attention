in  the company will hold a major racing event at tms in april and at spr in may 
as a result  although the company s business has been highly seasonal  it is expected to remain seasonal but to a lesser degree than in prior years when the company held nascar sanctioned races only in the second and fourth quarters 
in and  the company s second and fourth quarters accounted for approximately and of its total annual revenues  and approximately and  respectively  of its total annual operating income

although the company has expended significant amounts of cash in for the construction of tms  the acquisitions of bms and spr  and the improvement and expansion and ams  bms  and cms  the company s financial condition and liquidity strengthened during the year ended december  this strengthening of liquidity was principally due to in april  the company received net cash proceeds of approximately  from the sale of  shares of common stock in a public stock offering  in october  the company received net cash proceeds of approximately  from an offering of the debentures  record operating results for the year ended december   during which net income amounted to  and net cash generated by operations amounted to  and the company increased its net long term borrowings under the credit facility by  as of december  company management anticipates that the net proceeds of the equity and debt offerings  together with cash from operations and funds available through the credit facility  will sustain the company s operating needs  including planned capital expenditures at ams  bms  cms  spr and tms into based upon the anticipated future growth and financing requirements of the company  management expects that the company will  from time to time  engage in additional financing of a character and in amounts to be determined 
while the company expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from its existing speedway operations  and has experienced improvement in its financial condition  liquidity and credit availability  such resources  as well as possibly others  will be needed to fund the company s continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of ams  bms  cms and spr 
in march  the company obtained from nationsbank  na carolinas an unsecured  long term working capital and letter of credit facility the credit facility with an overall borrowing limit of  the credit facility matures in unless extended annually thereafter for two additional years at the option of the lenders 
borrowings are permitted under the credit facility for the following purposes i refinancing of certain short term borrowings  ii financing seasonal working capital needs  and iii financing general corporate purposes  including the costs of constructing tms 
although the credit facility is unsecured  the company has agreed not to pledge its assets to any third party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of additional terms and restrictive loan covenants of the credit facility 
on october   the company completed a private placement of the debentures in the aggregate principal amount of  net proceeds to the company after commissions and discounts were  the debentures are unsecured  mature on september   are convertible into common stock at the holder s option after november  at per share until maturity  and are redeemable at the company s option after september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of additional terms and conditions of the debentures 
the proceeds of this debenture offering were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  fund construction costs of tms and for working capital needs of the company 
dividends the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
any decision concerning the payment of dividends on the common stock will depend upon the results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans of the company  as well as such factors as permissibility under the credit facility and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
capital expenditures significant growth in the company s revenues depends  in a large part  on consistent investment in facilities 
therefore  the company expects to continue to make substantial capital expenditures 
a variety of major capital projects are underway  the most significant of which is the construction of tms 
as of december   the company s management estimates the remaining construction costs to substantially complete tms will approximate  numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may influence the ultimate cost of tms  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  adverse weather conditions  and accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site 
in addition  the actual cost of tms could vary from the foregoing estimate if the company s assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required to complete tms were to change 
the tms construction is also subject to state and local regulatory processes  which if changed  could materially affect the cost of tms 
in  the company completed new suites at ams and reconfigured ams s main entrances and expanded on site roads to ease congestion caused by the increases in attendance 
during  the company began a major renovation and expansion of bms 
the company is also in the process of acquiring additional land for parking and camping at bms 
in  at bms  the company added approximately  permanent grandstand seats and relocated various mezzanine level souvenir  concessions and restroom facilities at bms to increase spectator convenience and accessibility 
in  at cms  the company added approximately  permanent grandstand seats 
in  at ams  the company expects to complete new suites  add approximately  permanent grandstand seats  and is converting ams to a quad oval configuration  including changing the start finish line location 
in  at bms  the company expects to complete new suites  add approximately  permanent grandstand seats  and make other site improvements 
in  at cms  the company expects to complete new suites  add approximately  permanent grandstand seats  and make other site improvements 
in  at spr  the company expects to complete parking  road improvements  and grading to improve spectator site lines  and to increase and improve seating and facilities for spectator and media amenities 
upon completion in april  tms will have approximately  permanent grandstand seats  suites and condominiums 
in  after adding more than  seats  including the opening of tms  permanent grandstand seating capacity at all of the company s speedways will exceed  the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in  exclusive of tms  will approximate million 
on november   the company acquired certain assets of spr and executed a year capital lease with the seller for all of the real property of the spr complex 
smi has the option to purchase the real property for million during a six month option period commencing november   subject to acceleration at the election of the seller after march  and through december  monthly lease payments range from  in to  in in connection with the acquisition  the company loaned the seller approximately million under a promissory note receivable to repay their then outstanding obligations on the real property 
amounts due under the note  a million purchase option payment  and million lease security deposit are to be credited against amounts due from the company upon exercise of the purchase option 
in management s opinion  it is probable that the purchase option will be exercised 
in addition to expansion and improvements of its existing speedway facilities and business operations  the company is continually evaluating new opportunities that will add value for the company s stockholders  including the expansion and development of its existing legends cars products and markets and the expansion into complementary businesses 
environmental matters the company s property at cms includes areas that were used as solid waste landfills for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the cms property ceased in  but cms currently allows certain property to be used for land clearing and inert debris landfilling and for construction and demolition debris landfilling 
management believes that the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
management also believes that the company s operations  including the landfills on its property  are in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
management is not aware of any situation related to landfill operations which would materially adversely affect the company s financial position or future results of operations
