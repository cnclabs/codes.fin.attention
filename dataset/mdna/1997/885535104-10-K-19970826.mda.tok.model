as of march   us robotics assets and stockholder s equity totaled  million and million  respectively 
the company anticipates that as a result of the merger  the combined company will incur restructuring charges and direct transaction costs relating to the business combination  estimated to be between million and million 
these non recurring costs will be charged to operations in the first quarter of fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following information has not been restated to include the operating results of us robotics  and does not represent results of the combined company 
the following discussion  including business environment and risk factors  represents com on a standalone basis 
for information regarding com and us robotics on a combined basis  refer to the joint proxy statement prospectus dated may  for historical information regarding us robotics on a standalone basis  refer to its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   and its report on form k for the year ended september  business combinations on october   the company acquired onstream networks  inc onstream  a provider of asynchronous transfer mode atm and broadband wide area network wan and access products 
the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding stock of onstream  and assumed and exchanged all options to purchase onstream stock for options to purchase approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
financial data of the company has been restated for the quarter ended august  to include the historical financial information of onstream for that period 
as the historical operations of onstream were not significant to any period presented  the company s financial statements for periods prior to fiscal have not been restated 
to enhance its product offerings and accelerate its time to market in new technologies  the company completed several business combinations in previous years 
in fiscal  the company acquired chipcom corporation chipcom  a provider of computer networking multi function platforms  including hubs  switching  and network management products  primary access corporation primary access  a provider of integrated network access systems  and axon networks  inc axon  a developer and manufacturer of remote network management and data network traffic management products 
in fiscal  the company acquired sonix communications  ltd 
sonix  a provider of isdn connectivity solutions in the united kingdom  and nicecom  ltd 
nicecom  an innovator of atm technology  and chipcom acquired artel communications corporation artel  a provider of high performance communication systems for the internetworking and video distribution markets and dsi expressnetworks  inc dsi  a developer of intelligent hubs and internetworking products 
the impact of acquisition related charges on the company s operating expenses  net income and earnings per share are discussed below 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the above business combinations 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended may  sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative non recurring charges purchased in process technology acquisition related charges and other total operating expenses operating income other income net income before income taxes income tax provision net income excluding non recurring charges total operating expenses operating income net income comparison of fiscal years ended may  and fiscal sales increased percent to billion from billion in fiscal the company believes that the increase in fiscal sales is due to several factors  including growth in the data networking market as the internet  corporate intranets  client server applications and remote access services stimulate customers to migrate from shared to switched media and to larger bandwidth and higher speed technologies  such as fast ethernet and atm  to support data  voice and video multimedia traffic 
the company also believes that the strength of the company s product offerings at the edge of the network  including workgroup switches and hubs  the impact of a strong new product cycle in systems and adapter products  the continuous expansion of com s product offerings  and the ability to deliver complete data networking solutions for different connectivity environments contributed to the increase in sales over the prior year 
although the company experienced relatively strong year over year growth  the company s growth rate has moderated in the last half of fiscal the company believes this moderation reflects recent slowed growth in the networking industry  in combination with increased competitive pricing pressures in the form of aggressive price reductions and product promotions for certain products  particularly network adapters  stackable hubs  and workgroup switches 
the company also experienced declines in its router business  which the company believes are primarily due to delays in certain large enterprise customer orders 
the company believes that the industry is transitioning from shared to switched networks  from lower to higher speed technologies  and to more volume based pricing and distribution  and that these transitions may be adversely affecting customer purchasing decisions 
competitive pricing pressures in adapters  stackable hubs and workgroup switches have resulted in average selling prices declining more rapidly than in the past 
the company believes such pricing trends  as well as the uncertainties created by the trend towards switched networks  may adversely affect the industry s and the company s growth rates in the coming quarters  and consequently  the company s historical growth rates should not be relied upon as an indication of its future performance 
see business environment and risk factors discussed below 
sales of network systems products ie  internetworking platforms  remote access servers  hubs  switching products and customer service increased percent from fiscal  and represented and percent of total sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal network systems product sales was led primarily by the superstack r ii workgroup switching family  the cellplex r atm high function switching family  superstack ii ethernet and fast ethernet hubs  and the oncore r intelligent switching system 
the increase in network systems products was partially offset by declines in sales of the accessbuilder r access concentrator 
the company experienced a significant increase in unit volume in workgroup switching products and ethernet and fast ethernet stackable hubs  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices resulting from increased competition and pricing pressures 
customer service revenue is included in network systems products previously this revenue was classified as other products  and accordingly  all sales composition and growth percentages reflect this reclassification 
sales of network adapters increased percent from fiscal  and represented and percent of total sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal network adapter sales represented a significant increase in unit volume  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices 
the increase in sales was led primarily by the fast etherlink r pci adapters  the etherlink pc card adapters  and the etherlink iii family of network adapters 
during the third quarter of fiscal  a major competitor reduced its average selling prices on fast ethernet adapter products by approximately percent 
the company immediately responded with similar price cuts 
as a result  the company has recently experienced an accelerated transition from mb ethernet to fast ethernet adapters 
sales of other products represented one percent of total sales in fiscal and  and are not significant to the company s operations 
sales outside of the united states increased percent from the same period a year ago  and comprised percent of total sales in fiscal years and international sales increased in all major geographic regions  with especially strong growth in the asia pacific and latin america regions  however  in the latter half of fiscal  sales in certain european countries moderated 
the company believes that the growth in international sales is due primarily to the company s continued global expansion through the opening of new sales offices  and the expansion of its worldwide field sales  service and support programs 
sales in the us increased percent compared to fiscal substantially all of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
the company s operations were not significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal years  and gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the percentage point increase in gross margin in fiscal primarily reflected an improved shipment mix of higher margin workgroup switching and hub products and lower margin network access concentrators  and lower product material costs of certain adapter products 
factors causing the increase in gross margin were partially offset by a higher mix of certain lower margin adapter products 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company reduced its average selling prices on fast ethernet adapter products by approximately percent in response to the aforementioned increased competition  thus causing a recent decline in gross margins  which was not completely reflected in fiscal the company believes that the competitive pricing pressures in the fast ethernet adapters  stackable hub and workgroup switching products may well result in future declines in gross margins 
total operating expenses in fiscal were  million  compared to million in fiscal excluding an acquisition related charge of million related to the acquisition of onstream see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  total operating expenses in fiscal would have been  million  or percent of sales

as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to percent in fiscal  from percent in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the cost of developing com s new products and technologies  primarily switching  network management and value added software  and the company s expansion into new technologies and markets 
the company believes the timely introduction of new technologies and products is crucial to its success  and plans to continue to make acquisitions or strategic investments to accelerate time to market where appropriate 
as of may   most of the in process research and development projects acquired in connection with the company s business acquisitions have been completed 
the company estimates that the remaining costs in connection with the completion of outstanding acquired research and development projects are not significant  and are primarily made up of labor costs for design  prototype development and testing 
the increase in research and development expenses is consistent with the company s continued commitment to develop and introduce high quality  innovative products 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million or percent from the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses reflects the worldwide expansion of the company s infrastructure through internal growth and acquisitions  including an increase in personnel of percent compared to the prior year  increased investment in the company s worldwide information systems and costs associated with the company s expansion into the asia pacific region

excluding these charges  the company would have realized net income of million  or per share for fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended may  and fiscal sales increased percent to billion from billion in fiscal the company believes that the increase in fiscal sales was due to several factors  including continued strength in the data networking market as customers migrate to new technologies such as lan switching and fast ethernet  increases in worldwide personal computer sales  rapid growth in sales outside the us  and the continuous expansion of com s product offerings and its ability to deliver complete data networking solutions for different connectivity environments 
sales of network systems products increased percent from fiscal  and represented and percent of total sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal network systems product sales was led primarily by the linkbuilder fms ii stackable hub  the lanplex and linkswitch families of switching products  the accessbuilder integrated network access system and the oncore intelligent switching system 
the increase in network systems products was partially offset by declines in sales of certain product lines acquired from chipcom 
sales of network adapters increased percent from fiscal  and represented and percent of total sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal network adapter sales represented a significant increase in unit volume  primarily the result of increased sales of the etherlink iii network adapter and the etherlink pc card adapter and the introduction of the fast etherlink pci adapter 
the trend toward decreasing average selling prices in all adapter products continued in fiscal  but was mostly offset by the increased mix of fast ethernet and pc card products  which carry higher average selling prices

sales outside of the united states increased percent from the same period a year ago  and comprised percent of total sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the company believes that the increase in international sales was a result of strong growth in the asia pacific region  the breadth of the company s product offerings  its continued global expansion through the opening of new sales offices in asia  latin america and europe  and the expansion of worldwide service and support programs 
sales in the us increased percent compared to fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the percentage point reduction in gross margin in fiscal resulted primarily from a higher mix of certain lower margin adapter and network access system products and increased provisions for obsolete and excess inventory 
factors causing the decline in gross margin were partially offset by a favorable shipment mix toward the company s switching products and reductions in adapter product material costs 
total operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal excluding the acquisition related charge of million related to the acquisition of chipcom  the charge of million for purchased in process technology associated with the acquisition of axon  and a charge of approximately million for a settlement of litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  total operating expenses in fiscal would have been million  or percent of sales

the increase in general and administrative expenses reflected the worldwide expansion of the company s infrastructure through internal growth and acquisitions 
as a percentage of sales  such expenses remained flat at percent in fiscal and other income net was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the fiscal increase was primarily caused by interest income  which increased million in fiscal  due to larger cash and investment balances and higher interest rates 
partially offsetting this increase in other income was the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in the second quarter of fiscal  which in addition to increasing cash balances  contributed to an increase in interest expense of million in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal excluding the purchased in process technology charge associated with the acquisition of axon  which was not tax deductible  and the nondeductible portion of the merger costs associated with the chipcom acquisition  the effective tax rate would have been percent

actual results could vary materially based upon a number of factors  including but not limited to those set forth below 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors which the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable operating results 
in addition  there are trends and factors beyond the company s control which affect its operations 
in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements which may be contained in this report 
such trends and factors include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in general economic conditions or conditions in the specific markets for the company s products  governmental regulation or intervention affecting communications or data networking  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  and other factors  including those listed below 
the company participates in a highly volatile and rapidly growing industry which is characterized by vigorous competition for market share and rapid technological development carried out amidst uncertainty over adoption of industry standards and protection of proprietary intellectual property rights 
this has in the past resulted and could result in aggressive pricing practices  such as those recently adopted by a competitor in the adapter market  and growing competition  both from start up companies and from well capitalized computer systems and communications companies 
the company s ability to compete in this environment depends upon a number of competitive and market factors  and is subject to the risks set forth in this report and other factors 
the market for the company s products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
the company s success depends  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of new products 
an unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting data networking  or in market demand for products based on a particular technology  such as the recent change from shared to switched networks and the slowdown in sales of certain products for the edge of the network  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results if the company does not respond timely and effectively to such changes 
the company is engaged in research and development activities in certain emerging lan and wan high speed technologies  such as atm  isdn  dsl  fast ethernet  gigabit ethernet and data over cable 
as the industry standardizes on high speed technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond promptly and cost effectively to compete in the marketplace 
in addition  if the pc industry migrates toward standardizing the integration of network interface capabilities on the pc motherboard  and if the company does not manage its business to cost effectively transition toward this technology  it could have an adverse impact on the company 
although long term annual growth rates for the networking industry have recently been in the to percent range  there can be no assurance that this industry growth rate will continue at the same level  or that the company s results in any particular quarter will fall within that range 
in particular  based on recent softening of demand for networking products and competitive pricing pressures  the company anticipates that its results may fall below those levels in the coming quarters 
the company s customers historically request fulfillment of orders in a short period of time  resulting in a minimal backlog 
quarterly sales and results of operations generally depend on the volume and timing of orders  and the ability to fulfill them within the quarter 
as a result  the lack of backlog provides limited visibility to the company s future sales trends 
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel  especially in certain locations in which the company operates  is highly competitive 
unless the company can successfully recruit and retain such personnel  the company s ability to achieve continued growth in sales and earnings may be adversely affected 
the company operates in an industry in which the ability to compete is dependent on the development or acquisition of proprietary technology  which must be protected both to preserve the benefits of exclusive use of the company s own technology  and enable the company to license technology from other parties on acceptable terms 
the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of intellectual properties or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are equivalent or superior to the technologies of the company 
some key components of the company s products are currently available only from single sources 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company s suppliers will be able to meet the company s demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  any key components 
the company distributes a significant portion of its products through third party distributors and resellers 
due to consolidation in the distribution and reseller channels and the company s increased volume of sales into these channels  the company has experienced an increased concentration of credit risk 
while the company continually monitors and manages this risk  financial difficulties on the part of one or more of the company s resellers may have a material adverse effect on the company 
likewise  the company s expansion into certain emerging geographic markets  characterized by economic and political instability and currency fluctuations  may subject the company s resellers to financial difficulties which may have an adverse impact on the company 
the company will continue to invest in expanding its sales  marketing  service  logistics and manufacturing operations worldwide 
the company s sales and earnings may be adversely affected unless the company can successfully assimilate and train new employees in a timely manner 
the company may also be adversely affected if it cannot successfully expand its sales and distribution capabilities  in particular  the new manufacturing and distribution facility in the asia pacific region  in a timely manner 
acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies  including technologies and products under development  are an active part of the company s overall business strategy 
certain of the company s major competitors have also been engaged in merger and acquisition transactions 
such consolidations by competitors are creating entities with increased market share  customer base  technology and marketing expertise  sales force size  or proprietary technology in segments in which the company competes 
these developments may adversely affect the company s ability to compete in such segments 
on june   the company merged with us robotics see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and has completed several other acquisitions in recent years 
there can be no assurance that products  technologies  distribution channels  management information systems  key personnel and businesses of acquired companies will be effectively assimilated into the company s business or product offerings  or that such integration will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the size and number of such acquisitions and the requirements of coordinating geographically separated organizations  such as the us robotics merger 
there can be no assurance that any acquired products  technologies or businesses will contribute at anticipated levels to the company s sales or earnings  or that the sales  earnings and technologies under development from acquired businesses will not be adversely affected by the integration process or other general factors 
if the company is not successful in the integration of such acquisitions  there could be an adverse impact on the financial results of the company 
the high growth nature of the computer networking industry  coupled with critical time to market factors  has caused increased competition and consolidation 
as a result  there has been a significant increase in the acquisition cost of computer networking companies 
future acquisitions are therefore more likely to result in costs that are material to the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisition transactions in the future 
however  should the company consummate acquisitions in the future  the impact may result in increased dilution of the company s earnings 
the company s business is characterized by the continuous introduction of new products and the management of the transition of those products from prior generations of technology or product platforms 
in each product transition cycle  the company faces the challenge of managing the inventory of its older products  including materials  work in process  and products held by resellers 
if the company is not successful in managing these transitions  there could be an adverse impact on the financial results of the company 
the company s products are covered by product warranties and the company may be subject to contractual commitments concerning product features or performance 
if unexpected circumstances arise such that the product does not perform as intended and the company is not successful in resolving product quality or performance issues  there could be an adverse impact on sales and earnings 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
factors such as new product or pricing announcements by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s operating results  challenges associated with integration of businesses and general conditions in the data networking market  such as a decline in industry growth rates  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
these conditions  as well as factors which generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods 
notwithstanding the company s increased geographical diversification  the company s corporate headquarters and a large portion of its research and development activities and other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past trends and performance should not be presumed by investors to be an accurate indicator of future results or trends

the company began construction of  square feet of office and manufacturing space in december  and plans to occupy the manufacturing facility in the third quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company purchased a acre parcel of land and signed a lease for an adjacent acre parcel of land  both of which are near its existing headquarters in santa clara 
the lease expires in november with an option to extend the lease term for two successive periods of five years each 
the company has an option to purchase the property for million  or at the end of the lease arrange for the sale of the property to a third party with the company retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale price and million  subject to certain provisions of the lease

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on current plans and business conditions  the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  temporary cash investments  cash to be generated from operations and the available revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months
