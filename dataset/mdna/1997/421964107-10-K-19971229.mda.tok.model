item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in july to provide managed care information systems software to health care organizations that use managed care techniques to deliver services  manage financial risk and control costs 
since inception  the company has invested substantially all of its operating cash flow in product and business development 
the company introduced its first internally developed product  diamond formerly known as diamond bbx in fiscal  followed by diamond c s formerly known as diamond client server in fiscal and diamond q formerly known as diamond quick start in fiscal the company s revenues to date have been derived from licensing the diamond products  providing the associated implementation  modification  support and consulting services  and  to a lesser extent  reselling third party software and hardware 
software licenses typically are granted on a perpetual basis  although the company may also grant multi year  non cancelable term licenses 
license fees are determined according to the number of users licensed 
hsd requires each of its direct customers to enter into a minimum month support contract with the company 
from time to time  customers request that the company provide third party hardware in connection with system sales 
such sales of third party hardware accounted for   and of the company s total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects that license fee and service revenues associated with diamond  diamond c s and diamond q will account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company s financial performance will depend largely on the continued growth in demand for operational managed care information systems and the tools to implement such systems 
license revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the labor hours required to implement the system 
the length of the implementation process depends on factors outside of the company s control  including customers ability to allocate internal resources to the installation process and  with respect to certain customers  the need to obtain necessary governmental approvals 
in addition  substantially all of the company s license agreements may be terminated under certain circumstances 
the termination of license agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
therefore  the company is unable to predict accurately the amount of revenues it expects to recognize from license fees in any particular period 
implementation  modification and support fees are billed either on an hourly or monthly basis and are recognized as services are rendered 
third party software and hardware fees are typically billed and recognized as revenues when delivered to the customer 
in fiscal  the company entered into a marketing agreement with sms 
pursuant to this agreement  sms was granted software licenses for resale at a stated price 
for these licenses  the company recognizes diamond license fees when a diamond contract between sms and the end user is executed  and recognizes diamond c s license fees upon successful implementation of the system at the site of an sms end user 
for term license agreements  the company recognizes revenues ratably over the term of the license agreement between sms and the end user  which term typically extends five to seven years 
for those licenses after the first licenses under the original agreement  sms pays the company a percentage of the license fee charged to its end users 
sms must also pay hsd a percentage of all support fees paid to sms by its end users 
the sms relationship accounted for   and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
because of the amendment to the sms agreement  as described in item relationship with sms  revenues from sms are expected to be negligible in the near future  until the credit pool is exhausted 
the company capitalizes software costs for internally developed software 
these costs relate primarily to the development of either new products or significant enhancements to existing products which enable the products to penetrate new markets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
based on the company s product development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
the capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives not exceeding three years  commencing when each product or significant enhancement is available to the market 
year issues in considering potential costs associated with modifying computer software for the year  the company does not expect to incur any significant costs for its internal computer systems or the systems it has developed and is marketing to its customers 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal periods indicated  certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues fiscal year ended september revenues system sales services and other total revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing product development total operating expenses loss from operations interest expense  net loss before provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss revenues total revenues were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the growth in total revenues is attributable primarily to increases in modification revenues for diamond c s  increases in support revenues from an increased client base and a larger portion of third party hardware and software sales 
the company s relationship with blue cross and blue shield of florida  which commenced in november  accounted for revenues of  in fiscal the company s relationship with another blue  blue cross and blue shield of north carolina  which commenced in january  accounted for revenues of  in fiscal the sms marketing relationship accounted for revenues of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues from this relationship are expected to be significantly lower in the future due to the amendment described in item license fees per customer continued to increase as the company expanded product functionality and licensed its products to customers with a greater number of end users 
system sales 
system sales revenues were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal revenues associated with reselling third party software and hardware represented   and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  of which revenues associated with sales of third party hardware represented   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  diamond accounted for approximately of systems sales revenues  diamond c s accounted for approximately of system sales revenues  and diamond q accounted for approximately of systems sales revenue 
the company expects that diamond c s will continue to represent a significant portion of systems sales revenues over the next several years due to the higher systems sales revenues per client associated with sales of diamond c s 
as a result  the company s financial performance will depend largely on the market acceptance of diamond c s 
system sales revenues consist of license fees for the company s products  implementation and modification fees  and revenues associated with reselling third party software and hardware 
services and other 
services and other revenues were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal support fees continued to account for the majority of services and other revenues

cost of revenues 
the cost of revenues was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal cost of revenues increased in absolute terms primarily as a result of the increased number of personnel  both hsd employees and independent contractors  required to implement and support the larger client base  as well as a significant cost accrual related to the execution of the sms amendment referred to in item cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues is dependent upon the mix of license  service and third party software and hardware revenues  and may fluctuate over time as the mix of total system sales revenues changes and was higher in fiscal due to the sms accrual referred to in note of the financial statements 
the cost of revenues consists of expenses directly related to sales of software licenses  associated implementation  modification services and third party hardware and software 
operating expenses general and administrative 
general and administrative expenditures were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenditures was due primarily to staff additions and infrastructure to support the company s expanded operations

general and administrative expenses include the salaries and benefits associated with general management  finance and administration  as well as costs associated with recruiting and facilities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenditures were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal and was attributable to the growth of the company s sales force  associated support personnel and increased marketing and promotional activities  although the rate of growth of these expenses decreased in fiscal during fiscal and  hsd aggressively expanded its direct sales force 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include the salaries and benefits of the company s direct sales force and the cost of product marketing  advertising  travel and product literature 
product development 
product development expenditures  net of software capitalization costs  were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the increase in product development expenditures  net of software capitalization costs  was attributable to significant costs associated with the diamond c s development effort  including increased staffing and the hiring of independent technical consultants to assist such efforts 
the company believes that research and development expenditures are essential to maintaining its competitive position and expects these costs to continue to constitute a significant percentage of total revenues in the near future 
the company capitalized   and  in product development costs in fiscal  and  respectively 
product development expenses primarily include the salaries and benefits associated with the product development staff as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
interest income expense  net interest income  net of interest expense  was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively

net cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscal   and  respectively  and consisted primarily of acquisitions of computer equipment and furniture  as well as the capitalization of software development costs 
the investment in computer equipment and furniture was directly related to the increase in the number of employees and the acquisition of computers for software development 
cash used for capitalized software development costs increased from approximately  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of the relative increase in overall research and development costs and slight changes in the amount of research and development capitalized

safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of statements in this report concerning the future results of operations  financial condition and business of the company are forward looking statements as defined in the securities act of and the securities exchange act of investors are cautioned that information contained in these forward looking statements is inherently uncertain  and that actual performance and results may differ materially due to numerous risk factors  including but not limited to the following  as well as other risks which are described in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission dependence upon single product line 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from licensing its diamond software products and providing the associated implementation  modification  support and consulting services to its customers 
the company intends to broaden its product line through the development and introduction of new products and through product acquisitions 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to broaden its product line successfully  and any factor adversely affecting the market for any of the company s current products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
market acceptance  implementation and support of diamond c s formerly known as diamond client server 
in fiscal  the company introduced diamond c s  which is based on client server technology 
the market for information systems based on client server technology is continuing to evolve and the success of diamond c s is dependent in part upon the market acceptance of managed care information systems using client server technology 
although initial customer implementation of diamond c s began in fiscal  diamond c s was not used in live production by the company s customers until the second quarter of fiscal and has achieved limited acceptance to date 
therefore  there can be no assurance that these customers will not experience operational or technical problems which could result in the termination of customer contracts 
the company faces greater challenges in installing and supporting diamond c s because of the complexity of client server technology 
prior to diamond c s  the company had limited experience in installing and supporting products with client server technology and there can be no assurance that the company can obtain the necessary resources to install and support diamond c s in an efficient  cost effective and competitive manner 
the failure of diamond c s to achieve market acceptance for any reason could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
variability of operating results  length of sales cycles 
the company s revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including the number and timing of systems sales  the relatively large dollar amounts of customer contracts  the length of the sales cycles and delays in the implementation process 
the company has typically experienced sales cycles of four to nine months 
as a result  the company s results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations and its results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
any inability of the company to reduce spending or to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or receive anticipated revenues could magnify the adverse impact of such events on the company s operating results 
further  the commencement of one or more major implementations could generate a large increase in revenues and net income for any given quarter or fiscal year  which increase may prove anomalous when compared to changes in revenues and net income in other periods 
the company s ability to complete implementation of its systems and recognize revenues is dependent on certain factors outside the control of the company  including its customers ability to allocate internal resources to the implementation process and  with respect to certain customers  the need to obtain necessary governmental approvals 
in addition  substantially all of the company s license agreements may be terminated under certain circumstances upon to days notice 
in the second quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal  the company experienced terminations of license agreements 
the termination of license agreements could result in the refund of license fees and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product development and enhancement 
the market for the company s products is characterized by frequent new product introductions and enhancements  rapid technological advances and rapid changes in customer requirements and preferences 
accordingly  the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products on a timely basis that respond to evolving customer requirements  achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing on a timely basis and marketing such products or enhancements  that its software will not contain errors that would delay product introduction  shipment or implementation  or that any such new products or enhancements will be accepted by the market 
because the company s products are important to the successful operation of its customers managed care organizations  errors or delays in product development and enhancement may have a material adverse effect on the continued market acceptance of the company s products and may expose the company to claims from customers and third parties 
relationship with shared medical systems 
in january  the company entered into an agreement under which sms markets  implements and supports the company s diamond products to the sms customer base the sms agreement 
during fiscal  approximately of the company s total revenues were generated by sms 
there can be no assurance that sms will continue to sell the diamond products successfully  or that sms will be able to provide the level of service and support required to maintain its customer base 
the initial term of the sms agreement will continue through january with automatic renewals for successive two year periods unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than one year prior to the end of the then current term 
sms has the right to terminate the sms agreement prior to its expiration in the event of a material breach of the sms agreement by the company or under certain other circumstances 
the termination of the sms agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in december  the company executed an amendment to the sms agreement for the purpose of resolving certain disagreements between the parties and jointly pursuing opportunities in the european payor organization markets  amongst other matters 
the amendment provides for a million credit pool against which sms may charge billings for services rendered by the company  as well as future royalties payable by sms to license the diamond products in europe 
because of the credit pool  the company is not expected to generate significant revenues from sms in the near future 
in addition  the company has agreed to provide certain services and enhancements to the diamond software for sms s payor markets 
in return  sms will undertake significant investments in the european payor organization markets and has agreed not to initiate litigation for certain matters  provided the company satisfies specified obligations 
as a result of this amendment  the company accrued approximately  as of september  to cover anticipated costs related to performance disagreements under the original sms agreement 
management of growth 
the company is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth and expansion which has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  technical  financial and other resources 
the company s growth has resulted in an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company has sought to manage its current and anticipated growth through the recruitment of additional management  sales and marketing and technical personnel  and through continued enhancement of internal systems and controls 
the failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel  ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the company s future performance is substantially dependent upon the retention of key senior management  sales and marketing and technical personnel 
the company s success will also depend on its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled managerial  sales and marketing  and technical personnel  including project managers  software programmers and systems architects skilled in the environments in which the company s products operate 
competition for such personnel in the software and information services industries is intense and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future 
the loss of one or more of its key management  sales and marketing and technical personnel or the inability to attract  retain and motivate other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the market for managed care information systems is highly competitive 
the company s competitors vary in the size  scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop or offer products with superior functionality  including client server technology  or that other features of competitive products will not be preferred by the company s customers 
several of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources than the company 
in the future  additional competitors could enter the market  including providers of information systems to other segments of the health care industry  and compete with the company 
most of the company s sales are derived from competitive procurement processes managed directly by sophisticated clients or consultants that require specific  highly detailed presentations from several qualified vendors 
there can be no assurance that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on managed care industry 
all of the company s revenues in fiscal and were derived from the sale of software products and services to payors and providers that offer managed care products and services 
the company s success is dependent on continued demand for software and related services in that industry 
the company s growth is therefore dependent on the growth of that industry 
consolidation in the managed care industry could have a material adverse effect on the company  due to the decrease in the number of potential purchasers of the company s products and services or the acquisition of one or more of the company s customers by an acquiror that uses a different managed care information system 
the company believes that the commercial value and appeal of its products may be adversely affected if the current health care financing and reimbursement system were to be materially changed 
legislative or market driven reforms could have unpredictable effects on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary rights 
the company s success is dependent to a significant extent on its ability to maintain the proprietary and confidential software incorporated in its products 
the company currently relies on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws  software security measures  license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
however  there can be no assurance that the legal protections and the precautions taken by the company will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the company s technology 
in addition  these protections and precautions do not prevent independent third party development of competitive technology or products 
the company s practice of providing its customers with the source code to the company s software may increase the risk of unauthorized use of such software 
any infringement or misappropriation of the company s proprietary software could adversely affect the company s ability to retain and attract new clients in a highly competitive market and could cause the company to lose revenues or incur substantial litigation expense to enforce the company s proprietary rights 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringes the proprietary rights of third parties 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the company will not become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to current or future products and that such claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require the company to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  the company believes that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
to the extent the company wishes or is required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
recent losses  accumulated deficit  stockholders deficit 
the company incurred net losses of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended september    and respectively 
as of september   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately  the company has yet to achieve significant levels of profitability and there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future 
risks of acquisitions 
the company intends to grow in part through acquisitions of complementary products  technologies and businesses 
acquisitions involve a number of risks that could adversely affect the company s operating results  including the diversion of management s attention  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the potential loss of key employees 
the company s ability to expand successfully through acquisitions depends on many factors  including the successful identification and acquisition of products  technologies or businesses and management s ability to integrate the acquired products  technologies or businesses effectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in acquiring or integrating any such products  technologies or businesses or that any such acquisition will enhance the company s business 
product liability 
while the company s products primarily provide operational functions  they also provide applications that relate to patient medical information 
any failure by the company s products to provide accurate information could result in product liability claims against the company by its customers or their patients 
a product liability claim brought against the company could result in expensive litigation and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
possible volatility of stock price 
prior to march   there was no public market for the common stock  and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of the common stock will not decline below its current price 
the stock market historically has experienced volatility which has affected the market price of securities of many companies and which has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the trading price of the common stock could also be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly results of operations  announcements of new products or acquisitions by the company or its competitors  governmental regulatory action  other developments or disputes with respect to proprietary rights  general trends in the industry and overall market conditions  and other factors 
the market price of the common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as announcements of new products by the company s competitors  as well as variations in the market conditions in the medical cost containment or software industries in general 
the market price may also be affected by movements in prices of equity securities in general
