background the company is a research based pharmaceutical and medical device company engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of naturally occurring complex carbohydrate and other natural products for therapeutics in the treatment of major illnesses and the dressing and management of wounds and other skin conditions 
the company sells nonprescription products through its wound and skin care division  veterinary medical devices and pharmaceutical products through its veterinary medical division  and consumer products through its consumer products subsidiary  caraloe  inc see note for financial information on each of the segments 
the company s research and product portfolio is primarily based on complex carbohydrate technology derived naturally from the aloe vera plant 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  the company held cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the increase in cash of  is attributable to a private placement of preferred stock see note eight to the consolidated financial statements and the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and warrants see note nine to the consolidated financial statements that resulted in an additional  cash 
this increase in cash was partially offset by the retirement of all bank debt and the purchase of a  certificate of deposit cd see note four to the consolidated financial statements as well as increased research and development expenditures 
in march  the company repurchased of the outstanding preferred stock for cash see note eighteen to the consolidated financial statements 
although wound care sales for were lower than projected  the company was able to effectively manage and reduce inventory levels throughout the company regularly evaluates its inventory levels and adjusts production at both its costa rica plant  where the bulk freeze dried aloe extracts are manufactured  and at its us plant to meet anticipated demand 
as a result of these evaluations  inventory reduction programs were initiated in the latter part of and early these programs included reduced production at the company s manufacturing facility in irving  texas  as well as the costa rica facility 
as a result of these programs  inventory levels were reduced by  during  including a  reduction in the production cost of aloe vera derived products as described below 
as a result of the decreased production levels  the company expensed  of unabsorbed overhead as cost of goods sold in the production capacity of the costa rica plant is larger than the company s current usage level 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  in the first quarter of sfas requires that long lived assets held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
at the time of adoption  there was no impairment of asset value in costa rica based on historical production levels and future capacity requirements needed to produce the company s drug aliminase 
tm  then under initial phase iii clinical trials see discussion below 
in late october  the company received the results of the initial phase iii clinical trial for the testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules  which indicated no statistically significant differences that would support a conclusion that aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules provides a therapeutic effect in the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
as a result  the company terminated the second large scale clinical trial and placed further testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules on hold 
these results triggered a new assessment of the recoverability of the costs of the costa rica plant s assets using the methodology provided by sfas in the fourth quarter of the net book value of the costa rica plant assets as of december   was  the company evaluated the value of costa rica produced components in its current product mix to determine the amount of net revenues  excluding manapolr powder sales to mannatech see discussion of caraloe sales to mannatech below  attributable to the costa rica plant 
cash inflows for and future years were estimated using management s current forecast and business plan 
all direct costs of the facility  including certain allocations of company overhead  were considered in the evaluation of cash outflows 
results indicate there is no impairment of value under sfas however  there is no assurance that future changes in product mix or the content of costa rica produced components in the current products will generate sufficient revenues to recover the costs of the plant under sfas methodology 
as of march   the company had no material capital commitments other than its leases and agreements with suppliers 
in january  the company entered into an agreement with nationsbank of texas  na the bank for a  line of credit and a  term loan 
proceeds from the term loan were used to fund planned capital expenditures  a letter of credit required by a supplier  as discussed below  and planned research projects 
the line of credit was to be used for operating needs  as required 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with the term loan s fixed charge ratio covenant 
rather than amend the terms of the term loan  on april   the company s management elected to pay off the entire term loan balance of  plus  in accrued interest with available cash to eliminate the interest expense on the term loan 
all assets previously collateralizing the term loan were released by the bank 
the company pledged a  cd to secure the letter of credit as described below 
although the aforementioned cd matures every days  the company s management has elected not to classify the cd as a cash equivalent 
as the cd secures a letter of credit  described below  it is effectively unavailable to the company for other purposes until such time as the letter of credit expires or is otherwise released 
therefore  the cd is included in other non current assets for reporting purposes 
the line of credit agreement expired january  the company had reached an oral agreement with the bank for a new line of collateralized credit for approximately  however  due to fees that were payable for the unused line of credit and the company s lack of immediate need of cash  management elected to withdraw from discussions with the bank and allowed the agreement to be tabled until such time as a line of credit is desirable and favorable to the company 
in february  the company entered into a supply agreement with its supplier of freeze dried products 
the agreement required that the company establish a  letter of credit 
the term loan with nationsbank was initially used to fund this letter of credit 
the funding of the letter of credit reduced the amount that the company could borrow under the term loan but did not increase the company s debt unless the letter of credit was utilized by the supplier 
as of march   the supplier had not made a presentation for payment under the letter of credit 
in april  and in conjunction with the company s settlement of the term loan  the bank agreed to reduce the fees on the letter of credit by one percentage point in consideration of the company s agreement to purchase and assign to the bank a cd in an amount equal to the letter of credit 
the company will maintain the cd until such time as the letter of credit expires or is otherwise released 
the contract also requires the company to accept minimum monthly shipments of  and to purchase a minimum of  worth of product over a period of five years 
at the request of the supplier  the minimum purchase requirements were waived for the three month period ending december  the supplier currently produces the carrasorb 
tm 
m freeze dried gel and the carrington 
tm 
aphthous ulcer patch for the company 
both of these products represent new technology and are still in the product acceptance and launch phase 
the company had approximately  and  of carrasorb 
tm 
m and carrington 
tm 
aphthous ulcer patch inventory on hand as of december  and march   respectively 
current sales of both items are lower than the minimum purchase requirement  but the company believes that as licensing  acceptance and demand for the new technology increases  demand will exceed the minimum purchase requirement 
as of march   the company has purchased products totaling approximately  from this supplier 
the company is in full compliance with the agreement and  as of march   has the available resources to meet all future minimum purchase requirements 
in november  the company signed a licensing agreement with a supplier of calcium alginates and other wound care products 
under the agreement  the company has exclusive marketing rights for ten years to advanced calcium alginate products for north and south america and in the people s republic of china 
under the agreement  the company made an up front payment to the supplier of  this payment resulted in increasing the prepaid assets of the company 
additional payments totaling  will be made to the supplier as new products are delivered 
the company began a large scale clinical trial during the third quarter of for the testing of its aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules for the treatment of acute flare ups of ulcerative colitis 
the cost of this clinical trial was approximately  all expenses related to this trial have been recognized and paid 
in the third quarter of  the company began a second large scale clinical trial for the testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules for the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
the cost of this trial was expected to be approximately  of which approximately  was required as an initial payment when the research contract was signed on september  the full amount of the initial payment was expensed in the third quarter 
in late october  the company received the results of the initial phase iii clinical trial for the testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules  which indicated that no statistically significant differences were found to support a therapeutic effect 
as a result  the company terminated the second large scale clinical trial and placed further testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules on hold 
approximately  in cancellation fees was recorded in relation to this termination 
no significant additional expenses related to phase iii trials of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules are anticipated as of march  in late  the company began an initial phase i study using carravex 
tm 
injectable formerly carn in cancer patients involving six cancer types 
the estimated cost of this study is  of which  approximately  had been expensed as of december  an additional  has been expensed in the first quarter of also in late  the company initiated an ongoing program to reduce expenses and the cost of manufacturing  thereby increasing the gross margin on existing sales 
this program included a restructuring of the work force in costa rica as well as a change in the manufacturing process for aloe vera based raw materials 
product costs have been decreased through changes in product packaging and other costs have been reduced through competitive bidding 
where appropriate  the company now complies with lower usda or food grade requirements instead of more stringent fda requirements 
the company has restructured the sales force to position it for growth and is refocusing the sales effort to increase market share in the alternative care markets 
as part of this restructuring  the company eliminated six sales positions  including representatives in five sales territories 
the company replaced three of these positions with commission based independent manufacturer s representatives 
two of the positions were integrated into existing sales territories 
and finally  sales representatives in territories that were contributing a low return are now compensated under a compensation plan that emphasizes increased sales 
this compensation plan rewards the employee by paying a commission on every sales dollar 
to offset the higher commissions  the employees have a significantly lower base salary and are responsible for covering their own travel and entertainment expenses 
this program will continue into the foreseeable future and will continually challenge the costs of doing business and where possible  further reduce the cost of operations 
in october  the company completed a  financing involving the private placement of series e convertible preferred stock the series e shares 
at that time  plans called for much of the proceeds from this sale to be used to continue carrington s clinical research programs see footnote eight to the consolidated financial statements 
on october   the company announced the results of the first phase iii trial of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules 
due to the unfavorable results of the first phase iii trial  the aliminase 
tm 
project was placed on hold 
additionally  the company s management canceled the second phase iii clinical trial then under contract 
this event resulted in significant changes in the company s planned uses of and need for these funds 
in addition to the change in the company s needs  the decline in the market price of the company s common stock has increased the extent of the dilution that would have occurred if all of the series e shares then outstanding were converted into common stock 
for these and other reasons  the company s board of directors concluded that it was in the best interest of the company and its shareholders that the company use a portion of its existing funds to repurchase of the series e shares see note eighteen to the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the company completed a repurchase of of the above series e shares 
the company believes that its available cash resources  after the above described repurchase of the series e shares  and expected cash flows from operations  will provide the funds necessary to finance its current operations 
however  the company does not expect that its current cash resources will be sufficient to finance the major clinical studies and costs of filing new drug applications necessary to develop its products to their full commercial potential 
additional funds  therefore  may have to be raised through equity offerings  borrowings  licensing arrangements or other means  and there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funds on satisfactory terms when they are needed 
the company is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
certain of the company s proposed products will require governmental approval prior to commercial use 
the approval process applicable to prescription pharmaceutical products usually takes several years and typically requires substantial expenditures 
the company and any licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals 
future united states or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s or any licensees products 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested could delay or preclude the company or any licensees from marketing their products  or could limit the commercial use of the products  and thereby have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were  in  compared with  in this decrease of  or  resulted from a decrease of  in sales of the company s wound and skin care products from  to  or 
new products introduced in late january accounted for  in wound and skin care sales during the decrease in wound and skin care sales was partially offset by a  or  increase in sales of caraloe  inc  the company s consumer products subsidiary 
in the past  the company s wound and skin care products have been marketed primarily to hospitals and select acute care providers 
this market has become increasingly competitive as a result of pressures to control health care costs 
hospitals and distributors have reduced their inventory levels and the number of suppliers used 
also  health care providers have formed group purchasing consortiums to leverage their buying power 
this environment required the company to offer greater discounts and allowances to maintain customer accounts 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  the medicare medicaid reimbursement rate for hydrogels was significantly reduced from ounce per day to ounces per month 
this change significantly reduced the demand for hydrogels in the market place 
in february  the company revised its price list to more accurately reflect current market conditions 
overall wound and skin care prices were lowered by a weighted average of 
with the february price reduction  the company expected  and began to realize  a decrease in the amount of discounts required 
in addition to these cost pressures  over the last several years the average hospital stay has decreased over  resulting in more patients being treated at alternative care facilities and at home by home health care providers 
this also had a negative impact on sales since the company s sales force had been primarily focused on the hospital market 
to counter the market changes  the sales force is now also aggressively pursuing the alternative and home health care markets 
to continue to grow its wound care business  the company realized that it had to expand from the estimated million hydrogel market in which it competed to a much larger segment of the estimated billion dollar wound care market 
to achieve this objective  an aggressive program of new product development and licensing was undertaken in with the goal of creating a complete line of wound care products to address all stages of wound management 
as a result of this program  the company launched three new wound care product types in late january the company expects to launch additional products in caraloe s sales increased from  to  or 
caraloe sales to mannatech increased from  to  of the sales   was related to the sale of bulk manapolr powder 
pursuant to the supply agreement  mannatech is currently required to purchase a minimum of kilograms of manapolr powder per month at a purchase price of  per kilogram 
the supply agreement provides for an increase in mannatech s minimum purchase requirement commencing in april  but it also provides for renegotiation by the parties by march  of the purchase price to be paid by mannatech for manapolr powder 
the company has been informed by mannatech that the supply agreement will not be renewed 
mannatech has indicated it will honor the minimum purchase requirements through march   the termination date 
as the supply agreement between mannatech and the company will not be renewed  the exclusive license agreement for the manapolr trade mark will also terminate on march  the company will then be able to sell manapolr powder or license the trade mark to other third parties as well as use it in the company s products 
mannatech may continue to purchase manapolr powder on an as needed basis 
the termination of the supply agreement could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
sales of the company s veterinary products decreased from  to  in march  the company entered into an agreement with farnam companies  inc  a leading marketer of veterinary products  to promote and sell the company s veterinary line on a broader scale 
in  the company will begin to private label the veterinary line under the farnam name 
farnam has increased its sales force to improve the market share of the private labeled products 
cost of sales increased from  to  or 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased from to after adjusting for a  inventory valuation decrease on june   as described below  and period costs of  and  in and  respectively 
the period costs are related to the annual shutdown of the facility in costa rica for routine maintenance and inventory reduction programs 
the increase in cost of goods sold is largely attributable to the increased sales of bulk manapolr powder  which had a substantially lower profit margin in the first quarter of as compared to  as a result of decreased production levels in the first quarter of  and as compared to the margins on the company s wound and skin care products  and the overall price decrease which occurred in february of additionally  all of the new products introduced in the first half of are manufactured for the company by third party manufacturers and have a lower profit margin than the products manufactured by the company 
as a result of the implementation of programs to reduce operating and production costs  several changes were implemented at the company s costa rica production facility in early this facility produces all of the company s freeze dried aloe vera raw materials 
among these changes was a restructuring of the work force as well as improvements in efficiencies in the manufacturing process 
the implementation of these changes significantly reduced the cost of costa rica production in the second quarter of as a result of these reductions in cost  the actual cost of production under fifo as of june   was approximately lower than the company s standard cost  which was equal to the fifo cost of production at december  and march  the company determined that the standard cost should be reset to the then current actual cost of production 
this reduction in standard fifo cost decreased inventory valuation by  this amount represents the change in the accumulated value of all items in inventory as of june  that were produced in costa rica as well as those finished goods that contain component items produced in costa rica 
this decrease in inventory value was expensed in the second quarter as a period cost and is included in cost of sales 
to accelerate new product development and reduce overhead  the company was restructured in the restructuring included the lay off of seventeen high level and under utilized positions in administration  marketing  and research and development  for a net reduction in salaries and benefits of approximately  per month 
approximately  of these savings were offset with the hiring of kirk meares  vice president of sales and marketing  in the second quarter of also  the company relocated its manufacturing operations to its current facility on walnut hill in irving  texas  and immediately realized a reduction in overhead and production costs as the new facility is more efficient than the prior location 
as the walnut hill facility is owned by the company  rent and other facility expenses related to the former production facility of approximately  per month were eliminated 
each of these items is expected to reduce future expenses and improve cash flow results 
as a result of the restructuring  approximately  of one time charges were taken during of these charges  approximately  of severance compensation was paid in the first two quarters of of this amount   was a final payment to a single former high ranking research and development employee 
this negotiated payment relieved the company of  in future severance compensation liability to this employee 
as of june   all liabilities resulting from the restructuring were paid in full or otherwise relieved 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to  from  or 
this decrease was attributable in part to approximately  in one time charges in the first nine months of these one time charges were related to severance agreements  legal expenses and settlements and debt refinancing costs 
this was partially offset as the company incurred approximately  in additional costs related to the launch of three new product types and a one time write off of approximately  of bank and legal charges related to the early retirement of all bank debt in also contributing to the reduced sg a expenses were the benefits received from the cost reduction programs put in place earlier in the year as well as savings generated from the restructuring of the sales force 
research and development r d expenses increased to  from  or
