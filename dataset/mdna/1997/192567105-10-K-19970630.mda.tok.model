the company has not paid dividends since its initial public offering in february factors affecting operating results the company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could affect operating results and liquidity  including the following among others risks associated with acquisition strategy and anticipated expansion a principal component of the company s business strategy  particularly in its equipment services division  is to continue to grow by acquiring or opening new sites to augment its presence in markets it currently serves and in new geographic markets 
see business services and products cohr masterplan 
the sites acquired by the company to date have typically operated at a break even or small loss basis prior to acquisition  and there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to improve profitability of the acquired businesses by increasing revenues and eliminating duplicative administrative costs will be successful 
further  there can be no assurance that  in the future  the company will be able to sustain the level of growth through acquisition and opening new sites experienced to date 
the company s future growth and financial success will be dependent upon a number of factors including  among others  the company s ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates  consummate the acquisition of such businesses on terms which are favorable to the company  promptly and profitably integrate the acquired operations into the company  retain key personnel and key vendor arrangements of the acquired businesses and attain customer retention levels at acquired businesses that are advantageous to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful with respect to any of these factors 
competition the marketing of equipment services and group purchasing services to health care institutions is highly competitive 
see business competition 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
some of the company s competitors are nonprofit cooperatives that enjoy tax advantages unavailable to the company 
the company could encounter additional competition because many of the services and products it sells are easily obtainable by others from various sources of supply and such competitors could consolidate into regional or national networks 
significant increases in competition encountered by the company in the future may limit the company s ability to expand its business  or maintain its current customer base  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
risks of reduced customer base associated with consolidation of the health care industry as consolidation among health care institutions  particularly hospitals and integrated health systems  continues  the company s customer base may be reduced either because customers may be consolidated with or acquired by other entities or because purchasing decisions for products and services may shift to individuals with whom the company has not had prior selling relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain relationships with its customers following such an acquisition or consolidation 
any significant reduction in the company s customer base would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
costs associated with regulation of the health care industry the company focuses its business on providing services to health care institutions  particularly hospitals 
the health care industry is subject to extensive government regulation  licensure and prescribed operating procedures 
the acceptance of the company s services and products by its customers will depend  to a very significant degree  upon whether such services and products will be in compliance with applicable regulations or will assist health care institutions in complying with such regulations 
while the company monitors such regulations and designs its services and products accordingly  a substantial change in the level of regulation or the substance of particular regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
see business regulatory matters 
liability risks associated with governmental regulations and environmental hazards the health care industry is highly regulated and there are numerous federal and state laws which regulate the relationships between health care providers and the persons or entities which sell goods or services to health care providers 
these laws include the fraud and abuse provisions of the medicare and medicaid statutes  certain federal antitrust laws as the robinson patman act  the sherman act an the clayton act  regulations regarding the sale and marketing of insurance products  such as life and health insurance  fire and casualty insurance and variable annuities  and laws and regulations regarding worker safety  community right to know and clean air and water 
although the company believes it has been and is currently in substantial compliance with the applicable standards pursuant to such laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by existing or future requirements or incur materially increased operating costs complying therewith 
in  congress passed the federal acquisition streamlining act fasa to improve governmental access to commercial technologies and reduce administrative overhead costs involved in the governmental acquisition process 
under fasa s cooperative purchasing provision section of fasa  the general services administration is allowed to extend the federal procurement process by opening all of the federal supply schedules and the prices contained therein to any state and local government and any other public entity 
these non federal governmental and public entities which  according to an industry source  constitute over one third of the market  currently use private sector purchasing techniques to negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical  medical and surgical equipment manufacturers 
the effective date of the cooperative purchasing provisions of fasa has been delayed until october  or the closing date of the current congressional session  whichever occurs later  pending further congressional review as to the potential effect of the legislation 
if the cooperative purchasing provisions of fasa are ultimately implemented and the federal supply schedules become available to a significantly larger number of hospitals and other health care providers  the company believes that fasa might limit the company s ability to obtain the pricing discounts currently received by the company from many its vendors 
in addition  it is possible that many products now purchased under standard rates required under group purchasing contracts would be purchased under fasa 
if the company were unable to obtain such pricing discounts on its purchases  or if its customer base declined because of fasa  the company s purchase connection business would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that review of the company s business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect the company s business or that the health care regulatory environment will not change so as to restrict the company s existing operations or their expansion 
dependence upon relationships with third party vendors the company offers equipment servicing and group purchasing services for over  different products distributed or manufactured by approximately  vendors and is dependent on these vendors for the manufacture and supply of product 
presently  the company relies on vendors for i technical and selling support  ii favorable purchasing and delivery terms  iii promotional materials  and iv replacement parts 
the company s dependence on third party suppliers includes several potential risks  including limited control over pricing  product and service availability and quality  and delivery schedules 
the company s inability to maintain good relations with these vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
see business services and products 
impact of inaccurate reporting of purchasing volume in fiscal  commissions from manufacturers and distributors  together with access fees from customers  accounted for approximately two thirds of the revenues of purchase connection 
commissions are received from manufacturers and distributors in exchange for delivering volume purchases to those manufacturers and distributors 
in the group purchasing industry  it is difficult for gpos to determine accurately the volume of purchases made by their customers from manufacturers and distributors because orders are placed directly by customers with manufacturers and distributors 
accordingly  it is difficult for gpos to verify that the amount of commissions received from manufacturers and distributors accurately reflects purchases made by the gpos customers 
in order to verify the amount of commissions to which it is entitled  the company currently relies on manufacturers and distributors to report accurately purchases made by the company s customers  and the company s ability to audit such information based upon customer records 
although the company has developed power connection  an on line or stand alone electronic catalog that will enable the company to better monitor manufacturer and distributor reporting  few of the company s group purchasing customers currently use power connection  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in making power connection available to all of its customers on a cost effective basis 
lost commissions to the company due to inaccurate reporting of volume purchases made by its customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
see business services and products 
management of growth the company is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth and expansion which could place a significant strain on the company s personnel and resources 
the company s growth has resulted in an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management 
many members of the company s management team have had limited or no experience in managing companies as large as the company 
to manage its expansion  the company continuously evaluates the adequacy of its existing systems and procedures  including  among others  its financial reporting and control systems  data processing systems and management structure 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately anticipate all of the changing demands its growth will impose on such systems  procedures and structure 
any failure to adequately anticipate and respond to such changing demands could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
need for additional financing the company expects that the net proceeds of its november offering  cash flow from its operations and its ability to borrow from its existing credit facility will be sufficient to carry out its operations through the first quarter of fiscal the company may accelerate the expenditure of its available funds for acquisitions or other business opportunities 
as a result  the company may seek to raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities  the incurrence of additional indebtedness or other means 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing  if and when required  will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
dependence on key personnel the company will depend in large part on the performance of a number of key employees  including paul chopra  its chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the company has an employment agreement with mr 
chopra 
such agreement does not necessarily ensure the continued employment of mr 
chopra 
the loss of any key employee  including mr 
chopra  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to attract and retain skilled technical  financial  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
risks related to fixed price contracts in the company s equipment servicing business  the company offers contracts for services at a fixed price 
in the event that the cost to the company of performing services under a fixed price contract exceeds the quoted fixed price  the company would bear any such excess cost 
in the event that the company s costs of performing services exceeds the fixed price it is to receive under a significant number of fixed price contracts  the company s business may be materially adversely affected 
see business services and products cohr masterplan 
liability risks  limited insurance coverage  self insurance although the company is not a manufacturer  the servicing  maintenance and sale of medical equipment entails risks of product liability 
additionally  the company may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or related legal theories in connection with its security services and consulting services  including environmental  safety and professional consulting services 
the company maintains liability insurance coverage for certain contracts and such insurance coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain  and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
the company has elected to self insure for all contracts renewed or obtained on or after april  there can be no assurance that claims or judgments in excess of the company s coverage limits  where applicable  will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s business 
claims against the company  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to attract customers or expand its business and would require management to devote time to matters unrelated to the operation of the company s business 
dependence on third party reimbursement the cost of a significant portion of medical care in the united states is funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance plans 
in recent years  government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other health care providers have significantly impacted spending budgets in certain markets within the medical supply and equipment industry 
private third party reimbursement plans are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs through redesign of benefits and exploration of more cost effective methods of delivering health care 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s customers will continue to have sufficient spendable funds for purchase and use of the company s services and products 
a material reduction in the purchasing of such services and products could adversely affect the company s business 
reliance on data processing the company s business is dependent upon its ongoing ability to obtain  process  analyze and manage data and to maintain and upgrade its data processing capabilities 
interruption of data processing capabilities for any extended length of time  the failure to upgrade data services  difficulties in converting data and information systems after acquisitions  loss of stored data  programming errors or other computer programs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
inflation the company believes that its operations have not been materially adversely affected by inflation 
the company expects that salary and wage increases for its skilled staff will continue to be higher than average wage increases  as is common in the company s industry
