item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
forward looking statements when included in this report  the words expects  intends  plans  anticipates  estimates  and analogous expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements inherently are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks and uncertainties include  among others  general economic and business conditions  industry fleet capacity  changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration and production activity  competition  changes in foreign  political  social and economic conditions  regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations  customer preferences and various other matters  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based 
results of operations general revenues 
the company s revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates received 
revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  the company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another 
during periods of mobilization  however  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  the company may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig which was previously stacked  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently 
the company may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts 
such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract 
mobilization revenues less costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract 
revenues from offshore turnkey contracts are recognized on the completed contract method  with revenues accrued to the extent of turnkey costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met 
operating income loss 
operating income loss is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses are not affected by changes in dayrates  nor are they necessarily significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  the company realizes few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  the company may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income associated with loss of revenues 
the company recognizes as an operating expense maintenance activities such as painting  inspections and routine overhauls that maintain rather than upgrade its rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
increased depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
from time to time  the company sells assets in the ordinary course of its business and gains or losses associated with such sales are included in operating income loss 
merger with arethusa 
effective april   the arethusa merger was completed 
arethusa owned a fleet of mobile offshore drilling rigs  operated two additional mobile offshore drilling rigs pursuant to bareboat charters  and provided drilling services worldwide to international and government controlled oil and gas companies 
because the arethusa merger was accounted for as a purchase for financial reporting purposes  results of operations include those of arethusa from the effective date of the arethusa merger 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
industry conditions 
the company s business and operations depend principally upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and  specifically  the exploration and production expenditures of oil and gas companies 
historically  the offshore contract drilling industry has been highly competitive and cyclical  with periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates followed by periods of high demand  short rig supply and high dayrates 
the offshore contract drilling business is influenced by a number of factors  including the current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas  the expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and production and the availability of drilling rigs 
demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond the company s control  including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  the ability of opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production of non opec countries and the policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves 
years ended december  and comparative data relating to the company s revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below eliminations offset dayrate revenues earned when the company s rigs are utilized in its turnkey operations and intercompany expenses charged to rig operations 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings 
during september  the company completed its major upgrade of the ocean quest  expanding the rig to have fourth generation capabilities 
upon completion  the ocean quest is included in fourth generation semisubmersibles for discussion purposes prior period information will continue to include the rig in other semisubmersibles 
the company s drillship  ocean clipper i  is included in other semisubmersibles for discussion purposes 
year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenues fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    turnkey    land    other eliminations    total revenues    contract drilling expense fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    turnkey   land    other   eliminations    total contract drilling expense    operating income loss fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    turnkey    land    other   eliminations   general and administrative expense    depreciation and amortization expense    gain on sale of assets    total operating income    revenues 
the million increase in revenues from fourth generation semisubmersibles resulted from improvements in dayrates million and increases in utilization million 
the improvement in utilization for was partially attributable to the relocation of two fourth generation rigs during the prior year  reducing the days worked for these rigs during that period 
the million increase in revenues from other semisubmersibles was primarily attributable to million of revenues from the eight semisubmersibles acquired in the arethusa merger and increases in dayrates in both the north sea and the gulf of mexico 
the million increase in revenues from jack ups resulted primarily from revenues associated with rigs acquired in the arethusa merger and improvements in dayrates in the gulf of mexico 
the million increase in turnkey revenues resulted from an increase in project management service revenue during as compared to the prior year 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for fourth generation semisubmersibles increased million primarily due to the major upgrade of the ocean quest which  upon completion in september  is included as a fourth generation semisubmersible as compared to the prior year 
the million increase for other semisubmersibles resulted from the additional rigs acquired in the arethusa merger  increased expenses for shipyard repairs on three rigs  and increased expenses attributable to improved utilization during these increases were partially offset by a reduction in local payroll expenses resulting from the relocation of a rig and decreased expenses for a rig undergoing a major upgrade during the million increase in jack up expense resulted primarily from the rigs acquired in the arethusa merger  partially offset by decreased operating expenses for two rigs which were cold stacked during one of which was sold in july 
turnkey expense was relatively unchanged from the prior year 
other contract drilling expense decreased million primarily due to collections from a settlement in connection with a lawsuit and collections on accounts receivable written off in the prior year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased due to the arethusa merger  however  these increases were partially offset by cost savings in rent due to the february purchase of the building in which the company has its corporate headquarters 
in addition  approximately 
million of general and administrative expense associated with the major upgrades of the ocean quest  the ocean star  the ocean victory and the ocean clipper i was capitalized to these projects during depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  increased primarily due to additional expense for i the eight semisubmersibles and three jack up drilling rigs acquired in the arethusa merger  ii goodwill amortization expense associated with the arethusa merger  iii three rig upgrades completed in  and iv capital expenditures associated with the company s continuing rig enhancement program 
partially offsetting these increases was a change in accounting estimate to increase the estimated useful lives for certain classes of rigs 
this change reduced depreciation expense by approximately million  as compared to the year ended december  gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  consists primarily of the sale of all of the operational assets of diamond m onshore  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  to drillers  inc resulting in a gain of million 
in addition  the company sold two shallow water jack up drilling rigs  the ocean magallanes and the ocean conquest  and one semisubmersible  the ocean zephyr ii  resulting in gains totaling million 
interest expense 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  primarily consists of million to expense origination costs  including costs previously capitalized  in connection with the restructuring of the company s credit facility during december the decrease from million for the prior year was attributable to a reduction in outstanding indebtedness resulting from the repayment of the company s loan from loews in connection with the common stock offering 
in addition  interest costs associated with the company s financing arrangements were capitalized with respect to qualified construction projects during see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year 
this change resulted primarily from the increase of million in the company s income before income tax expense  partially offset by the recognition of benefits for utilization of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in in addition  during the year ended december   the company s tax benefit reflected the effects of profits in foreign jurisdictions where the company s tax liability was minimal 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
net income loss 
net income loss for the year ended december  increased million to million  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income of million and a decrease in interest expense of million  partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of million 
years ended december  and comparative data relating to the company s revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below eliminations offset dayrate revenues earned when the company s rigs are utilized in its turnkey operations and intercompany expenses charged to rig operations 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings 
year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenues fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    turnkey    land    other eliminations    total revenues    contract drilling expense fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    turnkey    land   other    eliminations    total contract drilling expense    operating income loss fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    turnkey   land    other    eliminations   general and administrative expense    depreciation expense    gain on sale of assets   total operating income loss    revenues 
the million increase in revenues from fourth generation semisubmersibles resulted primarily from increases in dayrates in the north sea and the gulf of mexico 
in addition  million in revenue resulting from amortization of lump sum payments  including mobilization fees in excess of mobilization costs  was recognized during these increases were partially offset by a reduction of revenues resulting from the mobilization between markets of two fourth generation rigs during the first quarter of the million increase in revenues from other semisubmersibles is primarily attributable to increases in dayrates and utilization in both the north sea and the gulf of mexico 
the operations of two of three rigs acquired during the second and third quarters of contributed a million increase in other semisubmersible revenue 
in addition  revenues of million resulting from amortization of a lump sum payment were recognized during these increases were partially offset by a reduction of revenues resulting from the mobilization between markets of three other semisubmersibles the ocean nomad from south america to the north sea  the ocean princess from southeast asia to the north sea  and the ocean baroness from trinidad to brazil 
the million decrease in revenues from jack ups resulted from cold stacking two rigs located in the gulf of mexico in mid  both of which were utilized during the prior year  coupled with lower dayrates as compared to partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in utilization for two jack ups which were moved from venezuela to the gulf of mexico during the first half of the million increase in turnkey revenues resulted from an increase in the number of turnkey wells drilled 
eleven turnkey wells were drilled during the year ended december  as compared to nine wells drilled during the prior year 
the million decrease in land revenues resulted primarily from a decline in utilization as compared to contract drilling expense 
the million increase in contract drilling expense for fourth generation semisubmersibles resulted from improved utilization of the two rigs located in the gulf of mexico and increased expenses for the mobilization of two rigs during the first quarter of to relocate the rigs between the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
the million increase in contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles resulted primarily from additional operating costs of million associated with the three rigs acquired in  including mobilization costs of million 
in addition  improved utilization for a rig operating in the north sea resulted in a million increase in operating costs 
these increases were partially offset by cost reductions of million from the cold stacking of two rigs located in the gulf of mexico 
one of these semisubmersibles  the ocean prospector  was cold stacked in the first quarter and reactivated during the fourth quarter of the other rig  the ocean quest  was cold stacked in the third quarter of and  in  was undergoing significant rig enhancements in preparation for a three year term contract 
the million decrease in contract drilling expense for jack ups resulted primarily from cost reductions associated with the cold stacking of two rigs in the gulf of mexico 
the million increase in turnkey expense resulted primarily from the increase in the number of turnkey wells drilled and cost overruns on one turnkey well in progress at december   for which an estimated loss of million was recorded 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million in due to increases in staff and other administrative expenses and the commencement in of the diamond offshore management bonus program  an incentive plan for cash bonuses to selected officers and key employees of the company 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense of million for included a million write down in the carrying value of a semisubmersible  as compared to a million write down on another semisubmersible included in depreciation expense for partially offsetting this decrease was an additional million of depreciation expense associated with the three rigs acquired during the second and third quarters of gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  of million resulted from the sale of a semisubmersible which was held for disposition and from sales of miscellaneous assets 
gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  of million primarily resulted from the sale of eight land drilling rigs 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease resulted from the repayment of all of the company s outstanding indebtedness to loews in connection with the common stock offering 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
foreign currency transaction losses 
foreign currency transaction losses of 
million for decreased million from million for this decrease was primarily due to a loss of 
million recognized in for the accumulated translation adjustment upon discontinuance of operations in venezuela 
see other currency risk 
other income 
other income increased 
million to million as compared to 
million for this increase was primarily attributable to additional interest income resulting from an increase in average cash balances during income tax benefit 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  decreased million to million  as compared to million for this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the company s net loss before income tax benefit of million  as compared to see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
net loss 
net loss for decreased million to million  as compared to million for the decrease resulted primarily from an increase in operating income of million 
outlook the deep water and harsh environment markets for semisubmersible rigs have experienced improved demand and higher dayrates during the past two years  due in part to the increasing impact of technological advances  including d seismic  horizontal drilling  and subsea completion procedures 
both the gulf of mexico and the north sea semisubmersible markets have experienced increased utilization and significantly higher dayrates since all of the company s markets have experienced increased utilization and higher dayrates in  and customers increasingly are seeking to contract rigs for a stated term as opposed to contracts for the drilling of a single well or a group of wells 
in  average operating dayrates earned by the company s fourth generation and other semisubmersible rigs increased percent and percent  respectively  from those earned during in addition  the company s semisubmersible rigs marketed and available for contract are essentially fully utilized and  of the company s semisubmersibles  have term commitments with renewal opportunities staggered throughout and beyond 
the company continues to enhance its fleet to meet customer demand for diverse drilling capabilities  including those required for deep water and harsh environment operations 
during september  the company completed the major upgrade of the ocean quest and the rig began a three year commitment 
the rig  which had been cold stacked in the gulf of mexico  now has fourth generation capabilities  including variable deckload of  long tons  a mooring system to meet  foot water depth requirements  enhanced subsea equipment  and upgraded drilling fluid systems 
in march  the company completed the major upgrade of the ocean star  including stability and other enhancements similar to the ocean quest 
the ocean victory  previously stacked in the north sea  arrived in the gulf of mexico in september and began modifications in connection with its three year deep water drilling program anticipated to begin during the fourth quarter of in addition  the upgrade continues on the ocean clipper i  which is anticipated to be completed in mid the market for jack up rigs continues to strengthen 
in  average operating dayrates earned by the company s jack up fleet increased approximately percent from those earned during the company s marketed jack up rigs in the gulf of mexico are currently experiencing full utilization  although contracts generally remain on a short term or well to well basis 
the company considers its upcoming contract expirations for these rigs typical of prevailing market conditions 
the company s three international jack ups and the jack up which the company operates under bareboat charter are contracted for terms expiring from may through february historically  the offshore contract drilling market has been highly competitive and cyclical  and the company cannot predict the extent to which current conditions will continue 
in addition  the recent improvement in the current results of operations and prospects for the offshore contract drilling industry as a whole has led to increased rig construction and enhancement programs by the company s competitors and  if present trends continue for an extended period  may lead to new entrants into the market 
a significant increase in the supply of technologically advanced rigs capable of drilling in deep water may have an adverse effect on the average operating dayrates for the company s rigs  particularly its more advanced semisubmersible units  and on the overall utilization level of the company s fleet 
in such case  the company s results of operations would be adversely affected 
liquidity net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased by million to million  as compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  and a million increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities from  partially offset by an increase of million from gain on sale of assets 
cash used in investing activities increased million primarily due to million of capital expenditures for rig upgrades as compared to million in this increase was partially offset by million of cash acquired in the arethusa merger and million of proceeds from sales of assets 
cash provided by financing activities for includes million of net borrowings under the company s financing arrangements and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options assumed in the arethusa merger 
these increases were partially offset by million of cash used in financing activities for repayment of debt assumed in the arethusa merger 
cash provided by financing activities for consists of the net proceeds from the common stock offering  after repayment of the loans from and the payment of a special dividend to loews 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the company has used funds available under the credit facility  together with cash flow from operations  to fund its capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
the credit facility is a revolving line of credit for a five year term providing a maximum credit commitment of million until december as defined in the agreement  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a per annum rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus 
percent until june   and thereafter plus 
percent or a base rate equal to the greater of i the prime rate announced by the agent bank  ii the federal funds effective rate plus 
percent or iii the adjusted certificate of deposit rate plus 
percent 
the company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused available portion of the maximum credit commitment of 
percent until june  and of 
percent thereafter 
borrowings are unsecured by mortgages or liens on  or pledges of  assets  but are guaranteed by all of the company s material domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility also contains covenants that limit the amount of total consolidated debt  require the maintenance of certain consolidated financial ratios and limit dividends and similar payments 
as of december   the company was in compliance with each of these covenants 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in february  the company issued million  including million from an over allotment option  of percent notes due february  the notes are convertible  in whole or in part  at the option of the holder at any time following the date of original issuance thereof and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date  unless previously redeemed  into shares of common stock  at a conversion price of per share equivalent to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
interest on the notes is payable in cash semi annually on each february and august  commencing on august  upon conversion  any accrued interest will be deemed paid by the appropriate portion of common stock received by the holder upon such conversion 
the notes are redeemable  in whole or from time to time in part  at the option of the company  at any time on or after february  at specified redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of the company  subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal and premium  if any  and interest on all indebtedness of the company for borrowed money  other than the notes  with certain exceptions  and effectively subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all indebtedness of the company s subsidiaries 
the notes do not restrict the company s ability to incur other indebtedness or additional indebtedness of the company s subsidiaries 
in management s opinion  the company s cash generated from operations and proceeds from the notes are sufficient to meet its anticipated short and long term liquidity needs  including its capital expenditure requirements 
the company s operating revenues and cash flows are primarily determined by average operating dayrates and overall fleet utilization  which  in turn  are dependent on the worldwide level of offshore oil and gas exploration and production activity 
capital resources cash requirements for capital commitments result from rig upgrades to meet specific customer requirements and from the company s continuing rig enhancement program  including top drive drilling system installations and water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
it is management s opinion that significant improvements in operating cash flow resulting from current conditions of improved dayrates and the increasing number of term contracts for rigs in certain markets  in conjunction with proceeds from the notes  will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures or acquisitions of assets and businesses 
the company s ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on the company s results of operations  its current financial condition and other factors beyond its control 
during the year ended december   the company expended million  including capitalized interest expense  for significant rig upgrades in connection with contract requirements 
the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures on rig upgrades during included in this amount is approximately million for expenditures in conjunction with the upgrades of the ocean clipper i  the ocean star  and the ocean victory for deep water drilling in the gulf of mexico 
the company sought to mitigate financial risk associated with these projects by deferring commencement of the upgrades until term commitments were secured with major integrated or large independent oil companies with projected contract revenues substantially covering the upgrade costs 
the company expects to evaluate other projects as opportunities arise 
also  during the year ended december   the company expended million associated with its continuing rig enhancement program and other corporate requirements  including million to purchase the land and the eight story building in which the company had leased office space for its corporate headquarters 
the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures associated with its continuing rig enhancement program  spare equipment and other corporate requirements 
the company is continually considering potential transactions including  but not limited to  enhancement of existing rigs  the purchase of existing rigs  construction of new rigs and the acquisition of other companies engaged in contract drilling 
certain of the potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business  although  in general  these opportunities have been related in some manner to the company s existing operations 
for example  the company has explored the possibility of acquiring certain floating production systems  crew accommodation units and oil service companies providing subsea products  technology and services  and shipping assets such as oil tankers  through the acquisition of existing businesses or assets or new construction 
although the company does not  as of the date hereof  have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such agreement in the future and such acquisition could result in a material expansion of its existing operations or result in its entering a new line of business 
some of the potential acquisitions considered by the company could  if completed  result in the expenditure of a material amount of funds or the issuance of a material amount of debt or equity securities 
other disposition of assets 
in december  the company sold all of the operational assets of diamond m onshore  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  to drillers  inc for approximately million in cash 
the assets sold consisted of ten land drilling rigs  all of which were operating  trucks  a yard facility in alice  texas and various other associated equipment 
in addition  the company sold two shallow water jack ups and one semisubmersible  each of which was inactive 
currency risk 
certain of the company s subsidiaries use the local currency in the country where they conduct operations as their functional currency 
currency environments in which the company has material business operations include the uk  australia and brazil 
the company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the company s estimated operating costs payable in local currency and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
because of this strategy  the company has minimized its unhedged net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
however  at present contracts covering three of the company s four rigs operating in the uk sector of the north sea are payable in us dollars 
the company has not hedged its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between us dollars and pounds sterling for operating costs payable in pounds sterling  although it may seek to do so in the future 
currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity 
when the company ceases its operations in a currency environment  the accumulated adjustments are recognized currently in results of operations 
during  the company recognized a loss of 
million for the accumulated translation adjustment upon discontinuance of operations in venezuela 
additionally  translation gains and losses for the company s operations in brazil have been recognized currently due to the hyperinflationary status of this environment 
the effect on results of operations has not been material and is not expected to have a significant effect in the future due to the recent stabilization of currency rates in brazil 
turnkey operations 
the company  through dots  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  selectively engages in drilling services pursuant to turnkey drilling contracts in which dots agrees to drill a well to a specified depth and profitability of the contract depends upon its ability to keep expenses within the estimates used by dots in determining the contract price 
drilling of a well under a turnkey contract therefore typically requires a cash commitment by the company in excess of those drilled under conventional dayrate contracts and exposes dots to risks of potential financial losses that generally are substantially greater than those that would ordinarily exist when drilling under a conventional dayrate contract 
the financial results of a turnkey contract depend upon the performance of the drilling unit  drilling conditions  and other factors  some of which are beyond the control of dots 
however  during  dots primarily provided project management services on a dayrate basis that are not accompanied by the substantial risks of turnkey contracts 
for the year ended december   dots contributed million of operating income to the company s consolidated results of operations
