item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the market for esl systems is in the development stage  and the company estimates that  as of december   approximately stores in the united states were operating such systems  out of a potential market in excess of  supermarkets and other stores 
large supermarket chains have tested the productivity benefits as well as the technical functionality of esl systems in pilot stores  as a result of which the company believes they are in a position to consider rolling out the systems 
the company s objective is to be the worldwide leader in the emerging esl system market as product adoption and penetration increases 
because the market for esl systems is in the development stage  market acceptance of and demand for these systems are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the company s success will depend upon the rate at and extent to which retailers choose to install esl systems throughout their stores 
the initial acceptance and rate of installation by retailers may be affected by numerous factors beyond the company s control  including the customer s assessment of the benefits of and the need for esl systems and the customer s available capital resources 
since its inception in april  the company has been engaged primarily in the development  design  market testing and  more recently  sale of the ers shelfnet system 
the company subcontracts to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the components comprising the ers shelfnet system 
in addition  the company engages unaffiliated parties to augment its internal development resources and to assist it in the continued development of the ers shelfnet system 
since inception and through december   the company has generated cumulative revenues of million  and has incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million  which includes non cash charges in the amount of million for stock option compensation expense 
the company historically has marketed the ers shelfnet system for sale at prices generally in excess of  per store 
the purchase of an esl system from the company has therefore represented a significant capital expenditure for capital constrained retailers 
the company now intends also to market its ers shelfnet system on a fee based arrangement whereby the company will own the system and  with no upfront cash cost to the retailer  furnish the system to retailers generally for a period of up to five years  who will pay monthly fees to the company based largely on their actual usage of the system 
the company believes the saygo plan will increase market acceptance of the ers shelfnet system 
however  there can be no assurance that the pricing strategy will be accepted by customers or will be successful in helping the company to attain profitability 
under the saygo plan  the company will recognize revenues as monthly usage and other fees are billed to customers 
also  under the saygo plan the company will retain ownership of the systems  which will be reflected as long term assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet and which will be depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of their economic lives or five years 
such assets will be subject to periodic impairment testing as prescribed by financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of
