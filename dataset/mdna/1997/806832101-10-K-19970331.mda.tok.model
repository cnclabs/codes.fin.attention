overview john c 
wooley and jeffrey j 
wooley acquired the company in and for the next six years concentrated their efforts on improving the existing franchise system 
between and  management focused on expanding the company s business by developing company owned stores  as well as franchising 
during this period  company owned and franchised stores were opened 
in and  the company closed or sold of its company owned stores due to difficulties with operations  and beginning in the fourth quarter of  management adopted the strategy of developing only franchised stores and relying on area developers to recruit and support franchisees 
in late and  the company concentrated on building its network of area developers throughout the united states 
the addition of area developers has resulted in an increasing rate of store openings during the last three years 
the company derives its revenue from several sources royalties  franchise fees  developer fees consisting of area developer and master licensee fees  company owned restaurant sales  and other franchise related activities 
between and  developer fees and franchise fees grew to represent a significant portion of total revenue as the company sold development rights for most of the television markets in the united states and certain international territories 
franchise fees increased during this period as the rate at which stores opened increased 
management believes that as it completes the repositioning of the company which began in  developer fees derived from these non recurring transactions will decline as a percentage of total revenue  while franchise fees and royalties based on franchise store sales will continue to increase 
as of december   there were stores committed to be opened by franchisees within the two years ending december  there can be no assurance that franchisees will open the stores committed to be opened within this time period 
royalties are based on a percentage of franchisees net sales and are recognized by the company in the same period that the franchise store sales occur 
generally  royalties are earned at the rate of of sales for stores opened after the year end  and of sales for stores opened before that time 
royalties are paid by means of weekly automatic drafts by the company on franchisee bank accounts for royalty stores 
currently  approximately franchised stores pay royalties on a monthly basis at the rate of 
this number of stores will decline as older franchise agreements expire the majority of which will expire after 
a portion of the royalties received by the company are paid to its area developers as royalty service costs for providing on going services to franchisees in their territories 
as more stores open under franchise agreements  the company expects that royalty service costs will approach of royalties 
see business franchising area developers 
royalties have increased since due not only to the growth in the number of stores  but also to increases in average weekly sales 
the increase in average weekly sales is due primarily to the conversion of older franchise stores to the schlotzsky s deli restaurant concept  as well as the selection of more free standing locations for newer stores  which have better visibility and generally experience higher sales than the smaller in line stores located in strip shopping centers which are characteristic of stores opened prior to franchise fees are nonrefundable payments received by the company from franchisees and are typically recognized into revenue as stores open 
the franchise fee for a franchisee s initial store increased from  in to  as of july  the franchise fee for each additional store committed to and opened by a franchisee is  expenses associated with franchise fees are shown as franchise fee development costs and include the portion of the franchise fee paid to area developers 
the company generally pays area developers approximately one half of the franchise fees collected from franchisees in their development areas  although the company agreed to pay some area developers up to of certain franchise fees as an inducement to develop their territories more quickly 
as the number of stores covered by these enhanced arrangements begins to diminish  the company expects that franchise fee development costs will decrease as a percentage of franchise fees to approximately 
the company charges developers a nonrefundable fee for the exclusive rights to develop a defined territory for a specified term 
typically  a portion of the developer fee is paid in cash and the balance is paid with a promissory note 
see business franchising area developers and international master licensees 
when the company has fulfilled substantially all of its contractual responsibilities and obligations  such as training  providing manuals  and  in the case of master licensees  reasonable efforts to obtain trademark registration  the company recognizes as revenue the cash portion of the fee and the value of the promissory note  as determined by an independent third party valuation 
restaurant sales are reported from company owned stores  and declined from to as a result of the company s strategy adopted in to develop only franchised stores 
the number of company owned stores declined from at december  to only two stores at december  however  restaurant sales increased significantly in because the company s flagship restaurant in austin  texas was in operation the entire year  having opened in late  and because two additional stores were acquired from franchisees during currently  company stores are operated primarily for product development  concept refinement and provision of training to franchisees 
accordingly  management does not believe that the operating costs of sales for company owned stores is indicative of costs for franchised stores on a system wide basis 
restaurant sales were not a significant component of revenue from through  but contribute more significantly to revenue now that the flagship restaurant is fully operational 
other fees and revenue are generated from private label license fees and the turnkey program 
the company has licensed manufacturers to produce schlotzsky s private label supplies and began receiving licensing fees from sales of private label foods to franchisees in late the company believes that private label license fees will increase as system wide sales grow 
see business purchasing  private labeling 
turnkey program revenue consists of fees earned upon the sale of real estate developed by the company 
the company expects to receive fees ranging from approximately  to  per turnkey program transaction in addition to rental revenue where operations begin at completed sites prior to the completion of the sales to third parties 
turnkey program revenue was not significant prior to december  general and administrative overhead expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other overhead expenses 
these expenses also include commissions  such as those previously paid to deli marketing  inc and certain officers of the company 
in and  the company invested cash flow from developer fees in new financial and information systems and new administrative and executive personnel to establish the operating systems and management infrastructure that management believes is necessary to service the growing schlotzsky s system

results of operations fiscal year compared to revenue 
total revenue increased from  to  royalties and franchise fees increased and respectively  from  to  and  to  these increases were primarily due to the increased number of stores opened during the period as well as the stronger sales volume of the newer stores 
there were store openings in compared to openings in also  average annualized volumes for stores opened in was  compared to  for stores opened in developer income decreased by from  to  and decreased as a percentage of revenue from to 
this trend reflects the company s transition from one time nonrecurring transactions to a revenue stream driven principally by royalties and franchise fees 
during  four territorial agreements were executed for foreign territories 
in addition  six area developer agreements were executed for domestic territories where the prior area development agreement had been terminated due to failure to comply with the terms of the agreement or where the company bought back the development rights and subsequently resold the rights to new area developers 
restaurant sales increased from  to  fiscal year was the first full year of operations for the company s flagship store in austin  texas which opened in late  and the company operated two stores purchased from franchisees during the second quarter of it is the company s intention to re market the units acquired from franchisees  probably after  once operations and profitability are improved at those stores 
private label licensing fees increased from  to  because of an increase in the volume of these products purchased by franchisees and the re negotiated terms of two contracts from major suppliers 
turnkey development fees rose from  to  in of which  was rental revenue for periods of operations prior to the sales of the sites 
the completion of sixteen turnkey sites and the sale of ten of these sites accounted for the increase in the current year 
other fees and revenues increased from  to  due primarily to an increase in the overhead recovery from the company s national advertising fund and other nonrecurring miscellaneous fees 
costs and expenses 
royalty service costs increased from  to  this increase was a result of the growth in royalty revenue and the increasing percentage of schlotzsky s restaurants under the area developer program for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the prior year 
likewise  royalty service costs as a percentage of royalties increased from to 
franchise fee development costs increased from  to  this increase was a result of the number of stores opened during the period 
restaurant cost of sales  which consists of food  beverage and paper costs  increased from  to  this increase reflects the impact of full year operations at the company s flagship store which opened in austin  texas in november  and the operation of two stores acquired from franchisees in the second quarter of the company expects these costs to increase only slightly in as expenses level off at the flagship store  subject to opportunities to acquire  operate and improve other franchisee stores that are not performing well 
it is contemplated that the company would re market such stores after improvements are made 
restaurant labor cost and operating expenses also reflect the impact of full year operations at the company s flagship store and the addition of the two former franchisee restaurants now being operated by the company 
labor costs increased from  to  additionally  restaurant operating expenses grew from  to  for the twelve months ended december  due to the training and product development performed at the flagship store  the company does not anticipate these costs to be indicative of those of a franchised restaurant 
general and administrative expenses increased from  to  this increase was primarily due to the addition of staff at the corporate office  the strengthening of reserves for certain receivables  and other administrative costs 
in addition  a one time expense related to the exercise of certain stock options by a former employee was incurred in the second quarter of depreciation and amortization increased from  to  the increase was primarily due to first time depreciation of improvements and equipment at the company s flagship store and the two additional stores acquired from franchisees during the second quarter of amortization of pre opening costs for the flagship store and the royalty value related to remarketing the two newly acquired stores were the primary factors contributing to an increase in amortization expense 
other 
a portion of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering was used to retire debt  with a portion invested in short term liquid securities 
as a result  net interest income was  for  a  improvement from the net interest expense incurred during income tax expenses 
income tax expense for the year reflects a combined federal and state effective tax rate of in compared to the prior year s rate of 
current year expense is down slightly as a percentage due to an expense amount in from prior years 
based on projections of taxable income  the company anticipates that its effective combined tax rate will be approximately to 
fiscal year compared to the comparison of fiscal to has been revised to reflect the more detailed revenue line items now separately disclosed on the company s income statements 
total revenue and net income remain unchanged  but more specific types of revenue are compared for consistency with the comparison of fiscal to revenue 
total revenue increased from  to  royalties and franchise fees increased and respectively  from  and  to  and  largely due to an increase in stores open at period end from to in addition  royalties increased because of higher volumes experienced at new stores 
developer income decreased from  to  and decreased as a percentage of revenue from to  reflecting the decreasing contribution of transactional revenue  primarily as the result of growing royalty revenue 
during  master license agreements were executed for foreign territories and two area development agreements were executed 
the developer receivables were discounted by an aggregate of approximately  reflecting a third party s valuation of certain notes and obligations not yet performed by the company 
as the company s duties and obligations were completed during  the company recognized these developer fees 
restaurant sales increased from  to  the change was due to the opening of the company s flagship store in austin  texas in november of private label licensing fees increased from  to  the private label licensing program was initiated at the end of and this change is reflective of the effect of the program for a full year in turnkey development fees of  were generated in as this program began 
no such fees were generated in other fees and revenue increased from  to  primarily from an increase in the overhead recovery from the company s national advertising fund 
costs and expenses 
royalty service costs increased  during compared to because of the increased royalty base 
this represented an increase as a percentage of royalties from to  reflecting an increasing proportion of new store openings in area developer territories 
franchise fee development costs increased from  to  because of fees paid to area developers for stores opened in their territories  but declined from to as a percentage of franchise fees 
this reduction reflected a return to more typical arrangements with area developers compared to the period when several stores were opened in territories where area developers received of a limited number of the initial franchise fees paid in their territories 
restaurant cost of sales increased only from  to  this increase reflects the operational impact of the company s flagship store in austin  texas  which opened in november  but was offset somewhat by the disposition of a company owned restaurant in houston  texas that was operated during most of restaurant labor cost and operating expenses also reflect the impact of operations at the company s flagship store 
labor costs increased from  to  primarily because of operations at the flagship store where much of the staff was added several months prior to opening 
restaurant operating expenses decreased from  to  for general and administrative expenses increased from  to  reflecting increased executive and managerial staff expense and increased costs associated with new financial and information systems and franchisee and area developer manuals  as well as opening costs for the company s flagship store in austin  texas 
because costs associated with developer fees are substantially lower than costs associated with royalties and franchise fees and because there were significantly more developer fees in compared to  operating income margins were lower for other 
interest expense decreased because outstanding indebtedness in was repaid with the proceeds of the private placement of class b preferred stock 
other income was not material for either period 
the company expects interest expense to continue to be a small percentage of revenue as the proceeds of the company s initial public offering were used to repay  of outstanding indebtedness 
income taxes 
federal income tax expense together with the texas franchise tax increased from  to  due to higher earnings 
the effective tax rate was for both years

as stores are completed  the company intends to sell the properties to third party lessors and invest the sales proceeds into the next location 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell properties acquired under the turnkey program at a profit or at its cost 
see business turnkey real estate development program 
based upon its estimates of the costs associated with developing turnkey program properties  the company believes that resources currently available will be adequate to finance the ongoing turnkey program in the near term 
during  the company used net proceeds from its offering to finance a majority of the development activity under the turnkey program 
the company has also obtained a commitment from a financial institution for a line of credit of up to million to provide financing for the program 
the company believes that proceeds from the sales of the properties as they are developed over time should be adequate to finance the turnkey program at the contemplated level of development thereafter  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in november  the company obtained permanent financing from a financial institution for  to finance the company owned store in austin 
this loan is payable monthly  is secured by fixtures and equipment at the store  bears interest at per annum and is due in november bee cave westbank  ltd  a limited partnership in which the company and its subsidiary  schlotzsky s real estate  inc  own a combined interest in capital and profits  obtained an interim loan of  from a bank in december to finance the construction of a retail shopping center

substantially all of the company s royalties have been pledged to secure company debt in the past 
however  the proceeds of its offering were used to repay most of these obligations 
accordingly  these assets are available to secure future financings 
the company guarantees certain leases of its franchisees for limited periods of time  which may affect its ability to obtain financing in the future 
to the extent that the net proceeds from the turnkey program  credit facilities  and cash flow from operations are insufficient to finance the company s future expansion plans  the company intends to seek additional funds for this purpose from future debt financings or additional offerings of equity securities  although there can be no assurance of the availability of such funds on acceptable terms in the future

new accounting standards 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
earnings per share and no 
disclosure of information about capital structure 
sfas no 
specifies the computation  presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share and is designed to improve earnings per share information by simplifying the existing computational guidelines and revising the previous disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
consolidates the existing disclosure requirements to disclose certain information about an entity s capital structure 
both statements are effective for periods ending after december  management has not yet determined the impact that sfas no 
will have on earnings per share  and there are no changes in disclosures associated with adoption of sfas no 
quarterly comparisons since the adoption of the schlotzsky s deli restaurant concept in  the company has experienced growth in royalties and franchise fees 
the growth in franchise fees has been realized sporadically  as store openings have tended to occur in groups followed by periods of only isolated openings 
store openings typically mark the recognition of franchise fees and the beginning of the royalty stream to the company 
accordingly  a large increase in store openings has a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue 
the timing of store openings can also affect the same store sales and other period to period comparisons 
store openings increased from in to in and in at january   the initial franchise fee was increased from  to  and was further increased to  effective july  the net profitability from developer fees is substantially higher than that derived from royalties and franchise fees because of the relatively lower costs associated with developer fees 
therefore  quarters in which the company derived a high percentage of total revenue from developer fees reflect substantially higher margins 
while developer fees have been a significant portion of revenue in various quarters  it is not anticipated that they will continue to be material after because most of the attractive developer territories have been sold 
moreover  the company anticipates that royalty and other revenue will increase above historic levels so that developer fees will decline as a percentage of total revenue  resulting in more normalized margins 
also  the company believes turnkey and licensing fees will continue to increase as a percentage of revenue 
management believes that the company experiences only moderate seasonality 
the company attempts to make store sales less seasonal by offering a variety of products which tend to sell better during various seasons
