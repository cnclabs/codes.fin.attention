organization the company distributes  sells and transports natural gas and propane to residential  commercial  industrial and agricultural customers in thirteen states 
the natural gas distribution business is operated through its five utility divisions  rather than as a holding company 
such utility business is subject to regulation by state and or local authorities in each of the states in which the company operates 
in addition  the company s business is affected by seasonal weather patterns  competition within the energy industry  and economic conditions in the areas that the company serves 
with the completion of the merger with united cities gas company this year  atmos is the th largest natural gas distribution utility company in terms of total customers in the country  and the fifth largest pure natural gas utility 
since its organization in  the company has sought to expand its customer base and to diversify the weather patterns  local economic conditions  and regulatory environments in which it operates 
as part of this strategy  the company has completed major acquisitions in   and in addition to growing through acquisitions  the company s strategy includes building the atmos team  running the utility operations exceptionally well  increasing the size and market share of the non utility operations gas marketing and propane  and developing plans to participate in retail energy services behind the meter 
in connection with its merger with united cities gas company  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company acquired certain non utility subsidiaries which contributed approximately of net income and offer potential growth opportunities 
one non utility subsidiary  ucg storage  was formed in to provide natural gas storage services 
in  a natural gas storage field was purchased in kentucky to supplement natural gas used by customers in tennessee 
in addition  natural gas storage fields located in kansas were sold to ucg storage and are used to supplement natural gas requirements of kansas customers

a table of non utility net income for  and appears on page herein 
acquisitions and mergers the company has expanded its customer base and sought to diversify the regulations  weather patterns and local economic conditions to which it is subject through acquisitions in fiscal years    and the company plans to continue its acquisition strategy to add new customers and service areas for both natural gas and propane 
it has an excellent track record of acquiring ldc operations that provide diversity in weather  regulatory patterns  economies and markets 
it has achieved synergies and benefits quickly  while preserving brand equity 
ratemaking activity rates and regulatory initiatives are at the heart of atmos utility operations and are important to both shareholders and customers 
atmos objective is to achieve rates that provide for fair returns for its shareholders while having these rates at low  competitive levels for its customers 
as the energy environment and industry change  the process for setting rates in the future may also need to change 
in that regard  the company is participating in a performance based rates experimental program in tennessee  which is designed to reward the company for performing better than certain benchmarks relating to purchased gas cost 
a similar program is underway in georgia 
atmos believes that performance based rate programs benefit customers and reward efficient service providers like atmos  and atmos intends to seek gas cost incentive arrangements and incentive rates in every jurisdiction possible 
the company received rate increases totaling million  million  and million effective in fiscal  and  respectively 
for further information regarding these rate increases please see note rates in notes to consolidated financial statements 
weather and seasonality the company s natural gas and propane distribution businesses are seasonal due to weather conditions in the company s service areas 
sales are affected by winter heating season requirements 
sales to agricultural customers who use natural gas as fuel in the operation of irrigation pumps during the period from april through september are affected by rainfall amounts 
these factors generally result in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september of each year 
for further seasonality information  please see the supplementary quarterly financial data following the notes to consolidated financial statements herein 
the georgia public service commission and the tennessee regulatory authority have approved weather normalization adjustments wnas 
the wnas  effective october through may each year in georgia and november through april each year in tennessee  allow the united cities division to increase the base rate portion of customers bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal 
the net effect of the wnas was an increase decrease in revenues of   and  in  and  respectively 
the company has not sought weather normalization clauses in its other rate jurisdictions because of the effect of its geographical diversification strategy and the potential for increased profits in unusually cold years 
environmental matters the company is involved in certain environmental matters as discussed in note contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements

excluding the effect of these charges  the company s net income would have been million or per share in  compared with million  or per share for the results include united cities gas company  which merged with atmos effective july   and prior year operating results have been restated to reflect the pooling of interests accounting which was used for the merger 
non recurring charges the company completed a management reorganization in and recorded a charge of million million after tax in related costs 
the cost of the ucgc merger and integration totaled approximately million for the transaction costs and million for the separation and other costs 
there are substantial longer term benefits to the company s customers and shareholders from the merger of the two companies  which the company expects to result in cost savings over the next years totaling about million 
the company believes a significant amount of the costs to achieve these benefits will be recovered through rates and future operating efficiencies of the combined operations 
therefore  the company recorded as regulatory assets the costs of the merger and integration of ucgc 
however  the company has established a reserve of approximately million million after tax  to account for costs that may not be recovered 
the company recorded these costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal year when the merger was completed  separation plans were approved by the board of directors and announcements were made to employees 
for further information regarding the merger please see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
effects of weather annual sales volumes and revenues vary in relation to winter heating degree days and summer irrigation demand 
the company has weather normalization adjustments in its rates in georgia and tennessee  but not in the other states in which it has natural gas distribution operations 
the estimated effect on net income of weather different from year normals is included in the previous table 
the decline in net income  excluding the charges and reserves  was the result of the effects of warmer than normal weather during the winter months  which negatively impacted gas throughput and sales as well as propane sales 
in addition  the spring months were wetter than normal  which adversely impacted irrigation gas utilization 
normal weather conditions would have added

per mcf or increase in sales price  despite a slight decrease in volumes delivered
