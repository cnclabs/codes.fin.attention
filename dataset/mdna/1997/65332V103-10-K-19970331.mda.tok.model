during that time frame  the company encountered certain technology and system performance issues relating primarily to the voice transmission quality of the mobile telephone service 
in response to these issues  the company and motorola took action on several fronts to address system performance issues in general  and voice transmission quality concerns in particular 
see part i  item  business nextel s digital mobile networks experience with first generation iden systems implementation 
in  the company  together with motorola  began pursuing a program directed toward the development and deployment of modifications to the first generation iden technology platform  which modifications referred to herein as reconfigured iden were targeted specifically at improving the voice transmission quality of the mobile telephone service

in this connection  the company anticipates that purchases of motorola manufactured infrastructure equipment will represent the largest category of capital spending 
during the last six months of  nextel placed orders with motorola totaling more than million of products incorporating the reconfigured iden technology  including system infrastructure equipment and related software and the new  compact reconfigured iden handsets that the company plans to market nationally  principally under the powerfone tm brand name 
assuming the successful and timely completion of the company s build out plan  under either nextel s existing business plan or revised business plan  the company expects that its digital mobile networks would provide coverage to areas representing approximately of the united states population by the end of implementation of the more rapid and extensive nationwide deployment strategy contemplated pursuant to the revised business plan would significantly accelerate the company s use of and needs for capital resources beyond the levels associated with the existing business plan and would therefore be dependent on  among other things  the availability of necessary capital 
in the event nextel determines to implement the more accelerated and extensive deployment strategy contemplated by the revised business plan  the company s capital expenditures and operating losses would substantially increase over the next several years

for the most part  such activities have been  and are expected to continue to be  pursued through subsidiaries of the company that are classified as unrestricted for purposes of the company s nextel indentures  including mccaw international 
while such classification gives those subsidiaries the flexibility to participate in and structure transactions in ways that comply with the covenants in the nextel indentures that are applicable to the company and its restricted subsidiaries  the nextel indentures do contain certain limitations with respect to such unrestricted subsidiaries  including limits on the amount and type of financial support that they may receive from the company and its restricted subsidiaries 
currently  the company believes that these unrestricted subsidiaries have or can obtain in a manner consistent with the terms of the indentures adequate funding to satisfy their existing and reasonably expected commitments 
in march  mccaw international completed a private placement of units pursuant to which it received gross proceeds of approximately  the pursuit of international wireless communications opportunities in the future by such unrestricted subsidiaries  however  may be dependent on  among other factors  their ability to secure necessary equity and or debt financing from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such financing could be obtained or  if obtainable  would be made available on acceptable terms

the monthly churn rate for analog smr operations not including the onecomm  ams and motorola operations  for which comparable churn data for the period prior to the completion of the respective transactions is not available for the year ended december  was  up from the monthly rate of for the nine months ended december  this increase was due principally to reductions in analog capacity resulting from the migration of frequencies from the analog smr systems to digital mobile networks and higher churn rates experienced in the analog smr operations related to certain of the acquisitions 
there was insufficient history of customer activity on the digital mobile networks to derive a meaningful churn rate for the digital mobile networks for the respective periods 
analog equipment sales and maintenance revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the nine months ended december  cost of analog equipment sales and maintenance increased by  to  for the year ended december  as compared to the nine months ended december  the increase in analog equipment sales and maintenance and the related costs reflect primarily the full year impact of companies acquired in nextel s analog smr unit sales decreased as a result of the company s continuing focus away from the sale of smr analog radios and migration of analog smr customers to the digital mobile networks in the markets in which digital mobile networks have begun operating 
cost of radio service revenue for the year ended december  increased by  to  for the nine months ended december  as compared to the nine months ended december   reflecting primarily increased infrastructure costs associated with the digital mobile networks

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december  as compared to the nine months ended december  the increase other than the financial impact of the additional quarter in the current fiscal year principally related to additional selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the operations acquired in acquisitions and increased staffing and other activities to support the implementation and operation of the digital mobile networks 
selling  general and administrative expenses include a loss on digital mobile equipment sales of  compared to a loss of  for the nine months ended december   reflecting  in part  the effect of customer subsidies or discounts on increased sales of digital mobile units during the year ended december  expenses related to the corporate reorganization for the year ended december  result from accrual of estimated employee and facility related costs pursuant to the announced consolidation  resizing and relocation of the company s headquarters and customer care operations in connection with certain business combinations consummated during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
no such costs were incurred in depreciation and amortization increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to the nine months ended december   reflecting principally other than the financial impact of the additional quarter in the current fiscal year the effect of the additional depreciation and amortization charges associated with the operations acquired and the activation of digital mobile networks in additional market areas during system assets relating to the development of digital mobile networks represent the largest portion of capital expenditures incurred by the company 
depreciation and amortization of such assets begins upon commencement of commercial service in each market 
as the company anticipates that additional digital mobile networks may be activated during fiscal years and through growth and acquisitions  depreciation and amortization expense is expected to continue to increase significantly during these years 
interest income decreased by  to  for the year ended december  as compared to the nine months ended december   principally reflecting the company s utilization of cash for the development and implementation of its digital mobile networks and for acquisitions 
this utilization was partially offset by the cash investment from the mccaw transaction 
see part i  item  business agreements with significant stockholders the mccaw investor and note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense totaled  for the year ended december   up  from the nine months ended december   reflecting principally other than the financial impact of the additional quarter in the fiscal year increased interest expense attributable to the assumption of onecomm s senior redeemable discount notes due the increase in interest expense from such notes was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest relating to construction in progress of digital mobile networks 
during the year ended december   the company capitalized interest of approximately  as compared to  for the nine months ended december  other expenses of  primarily reflect the company s  write down of its investment in mobilcom as a result of the devaluation of the mexican peso during the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the nine months ended december  these benefits resulted from the utilization of net operating losses against deferred tax liabilities 
the effect of the acquisitions  the increase in digital mobile network related costs and increased depreciation and amortization other than the financial impact of the additional quarter in the fiscal year were the primary factors in the  increase in net loss to  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the nine months ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company had net losses of  and  for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the operating expenses associated with developing and operating the digital mobile networks have more than offset digital service revenues and the operating earnings of the analog smr operations  including those acquired in the acquisitions  and are expected to continue to offset such operating earnings for the next several years 
the company has consistently used external sources of funds  primarily from equity issuances and the incurrence of debt  to fund operations  acquisitions  capital expenditures and other non operating needs 
for the next several years  the company anticipates using its existing cash and investments  cash flow from analog operations and externally generated funds from debt and equity sources as discussed below to cover future needs including the design  implementation and operation of the digital mobile networks 
working capital was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the use of cash of  resulting from increased capital expenditures related to the digital mobile networks and increased operating expenses

effective september   nextel  nfc and certain subsidiaries of nextel entered into the bank credit facility 
concurrently therewith  nextel  nfc and certain subsidiaries of nextel entered into the vendor credit facility  which superseded the previous financing agreement among nextel  certain of its subsidiaries  motorola and ntfc 
the bank credit facility provides for up to  of secured financing  consisting of a  revolving loan and  in term loans 
the vendor credit facility provides for up to  of secured financing  consisting of a  revolving loan and  in term loans 
borrowings under the bank credit facility and the vendor credit facility are ratably secured by liens on assets of nextel s subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries under the terms of the nextel indentures 
as of december   nextel had drawn approximately  of its available financing under the bank credit facility  leaving an aggregate of approximately  available for borrowing under such facility  and had drawn  of its available financing under the vendor credit facility  leaving an aggregate of approximately  available for borrowing under such facility  subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of applicable borrowing conditions 
the proceeds from these borrowings were used primarily to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the prior financing agreements with motorola and to fund operations 
subsequent to  nextel and motorola reached agreement on the additional motorola financing  pursuant to which nextel could access up to an additional  of equipment financing through motorola 
see part i  item  business post fiscal year end transactions and developments nextel motorola agreements 
in order to access such additional motorola financing  nextel would be required to procure certain consents  waivers and or participation commitments from a number of third parties  and to obtain modifications to the terms of the bank and vendor credit facilities  the related security documents and the nextel indentures and to satisfy certain other conditions 
nextel is in the process of seeking certain of such consents  waivers  commitments and other actions to obtain access to a portion of the additional motorola financing  but there can be no assurance that nextel will be successful in this regard  or that other conditions to access such additional motorola financing  including those that nextel is not currently seeking to fulfill  will be satisfied or otherwise will be dealt with in a timely fashion 
on march   mccaw international completed a private placement of  units yielding approximately  of gross proceeds 
each unit is comprised of a year senior discount note and a warrant to purchase shares of mccaw international common stock 
the notes have a yield to maturity  are noncallable for five years  and require no interest payments for the first five years

cash flows 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase was the increase in costs incurred during the year ended december  related to the operation of the digital mobile networks 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   net of the  decrease in marketable securities and  received from the acquisition of dial page 
cash used in investing activities related principally to capital expenditures for the build out of the digital mobile networks and acquisitions and certain foreign investments made during the period 
financing activities during the year ended december  consisted primarily of the  net borrowings and proceeds from stock issuances of  the resulting decrease in cash and cash equivalents from december  was  to a balance of  at december  future capital needs and resources nextel anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  it will be utilizing significant amounts of its available cash for capital expenditures for the construction of digital mobile networks including the anticipated conversion of its existing digital mobile networks to utilize the reconfigured iden technology platform  operating expenses relating both to the digital mobile networks and to nextel s analog smr networks  potential acquisitions including the acquisition of rights to spectrum through the contemplated mhz spectrum auction process and corporate expenditures 
nextel anticipates that its cash utilization for capital expenditures and other investing activities and operating losses will continue to exceed its cash flows from operating activities over the next several years 
during fiscal year  nextel s average monthly cash utilization rate for investing activities principally attributable to capital expenditures for the build out of the digital mobile networks was approximately  and its average monthly operating losses exclusive of non cash items were approximately  such average monthly amounts are not necessarily representative of nextel s anticipated experience in such areas and would be expected to increase during and in connection with the deployment of the reconfigured iden technology platform  particularly if the company is able and decides to implement the revised business plan 
during the ongoing start up phase of its digital mobile networks  nextel expects that it will need to utilize its existing cash and funding from outside sources to meet its cash needs resulting from such activities and losses 
nextel s aggregate cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  totaled approximately at december   nextel had drawn approximately  of its available financing under the bank credit facility  leaving an aggregate of approximately  available for borrowing under such facility  and had drawn  of its available financing under the vendor credit facility  leaving an aggregate of approximately  available for borrowing under such facility  subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of applicable borrowing conditions 
the bank credit agreement contemplates that the company  with the consent of the lenders under the bank credit agreement and the vendor credit agreement  may borrow up to an additional  subject to certain limitations under the bank credit facility the additional bank borrowings 
the bank credit agreement also contemplates that borrowings under the vendor credit facility may be increased by up to  subject to certain limitations the additional vendor borrowings 
see post fiscal year end transactions and developments consent solicitation 
nextel is currently taking steps to obtain additional sources of funding in addition to the amounts currently available under the bank and vendor credit facilities  including the additional bank borrowings and additional vendor borrowings 
availability of the additional bank borrowings is subject  among other things  to the approval of a majority of the lenders under the bank credit agreement and the vendor credit agreement 
there are currently no legally binding agreements or understandings with any lenders with respect to the terms other than the provisions contained in the bank credit agreement and the vendor credit agreement that would permit such additional borrowing with majority approval of the lenders thereunder on which such additional bank borrowings may be made available 
nextel has also reached an understanding with motorola concerning the terms on which motorola would make the  in additional vendor borrowings available and the terms on which motorola would make additional secured equipment financing available 
see post fiscal year end transactions and developments nextel motorola agreements 
nextel believes that is has sufficient funds currently available pursuant to the bank and vendor credit facilities currently in place but excluding any amounts that would be available to it through the additional bank borrowings  the additional vendor borrowings  the second secured borrowings and the senior secured borrowings the availability of each of which is subject to certain conditions  including those described herein and pursuant to the assumed exercise of the currently outstanding warrants and options to acquire shares of class a common stock described below  to meet its cash needs for the remainder of and into early  based on continuation of its first stage nationwide digital mobile networks build out approach consistent with its existing business plan  in light of its current and currently committed business and investment activities and assuming a conservative ramp up in digital mobile systems subscriber growth 
to fully complete its first stage nationwide digital mobile networks build out in as envisioned in the existing business plan  and to adopt and implement the revised business plan  nextel would need to obtain additional amounts of debt or equity financing beyond that available under the bank and vendor facilities currently in place excluding amounts constituting additional bank borrowings  additional vendor borrowings  second secured borrowings and senior secured borrowings and equity proceeds of  associated with an assumed exercise in full of certain options held by the mccaw investor discussed below 
the additional financing that would be required to carry out the existing business plan activities through would primarily consist of equity or debt funding to substitute for the proceeds that would have been received upon an exercise in full of the warrants for  shares of class a common stock previously held by comcast fci 
to the extent such additional financing were in the form of debt rather than equity  it is likely that changes to the terms of the nextel indentures would be required to permit the company the needed flexibility to incur such debt 
see post fiscal year end transactions and developments consent solicitation and nextel motorola agreements 
see also forward looking statements 
significant additional financing would be required to adopt and implement the revised business plan 
as indicated above under post fiscal year end transactions and developments  the company is currently investigating and taking a variety of actions directed to obtain access to significant additional amounts of debt financing 
however  assuming i that the company obtains the relief it is seeking from the holders of the nextel notes  especially the changes in the provisions of the nextel indentures that relate to permitted debt  and ii that the company secures access to all of the available funds under the existing bank and vendor credit facility  and is able to structure satisfactory arrangements to make the additional  in second secured borrowings from motorola available including obtaining access to the  in additional bank borrowings and to the  in additional vendor borrowings  the company estimates that it would have sufficient financing available to meet its cash needs through and completion of the existing business plan 
the company estimates that approximately an additional  in financing would be required to meet the company s anticipated cash needs through  assuming implementation and completion of the revised business plan 
see revised business plan 
in all of such financing scenarios  nextel has assumed that all of the funds currently available pursuant to the bank and vendor credit facilities may be borrowed thereunder and that certain currently outstanding warrants and options to acquire shares of class a common stock described below will be exercised in full before their respective currently scheduled expiration dates 
see forward looking statements 
other than the arrangements summarized under post fiscal year end transactions and developments nextel motorola agreements  which are subject to a number of conditions  there are currently no commitments or understandings with third parties to obtain funding required to meet such funding shortfall 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the additional bank borrowings or any portion of the additional motorola financing will be available or that the outstanding warrants and options will be exercised 
both the bank and vendor credit facilities and the nextel indentures contain provisions that operate to limit the amount of borrowings that may be incurred by the company 
the company intends to seek the consent of the holders of the nextel notes to certain amendments to the nextel indentures that would  among other things  permit the company to incur additional indebtedness to meet the funding requirements associated with completion of its existing business plan and implementation of its revised business plan 
see post fiscal year end transactions and developments consent solicitation 
in addition  nextel s capital needs  and its ability to adequately address those needs through debt or equity funding sources  are subject to a variety of factors that cannot presently be predicted with certainty  such as the commercial success of nextel s digital mobile networks incorporating the reconfigured iden technology  the amount and timing of nextel s capital expenditures and operating losses  and the market price of the class a common stock 
see forward looking statements 
nextel currently is aware of numerous factors and considerations  any one or more of which could have a material effect on the timing and or amount of the future funding to be required by nextel  but nextel cannot currently quantify with precision either the magnitude or the certainty of the effects associated with any such factors 
these factors include i the timing of the anticipated mhz spectrum auction process  and the amounts required to be bid to acquire any or all of the available spectrum blocks in the major metropolitan market areas where nextel currently operates  or currently plans to operate  its digital mobile network and the amounts that may be required to accomplish retuning or acquisition of mhz incumbent channels in spectrum blocks that may be acquired by nextel in the mhz spectrum auction process  ii the uncertainty with respect to the success and or timing of the continuing development and deployment activities relating to the reconfigured iden technology format and  assuming successful and timely completion of such efforts  the uncertainty with respect to the successful commercial introduction and customer acceptance of nextel s digital mobile services in new market areas using such technology  iii the potential commercial opportunities and risks associated with implementation of nextel s revised business plan and iv the net impact on nextel s capital budget of certain developments currently expected to increase capital needs eg  the additional capital needed if nextel acquires for cash additional spectrum in certain markets to increase the capacity and or efficiency of nextel s operating digital mobile networks in such markets  the additional capital needed for more extensive construction of digital mobile networks in additional market areas acquired or that may be acquired by nextel in the future and in connection with the conversion of existing digital mobile networks to the reconfigured iden technology format  the expenditures associated with analog smr station construction requirements under the currently effective fcc mhz channel licensing approach that may be offset whether wholly or partially by other developments anticipated to or to have the potential to reduce capital needs eg  co location of antenna and or transmitter sites with other providers of wireless services in the relevant markets  reductions in infrastructure and subscriber unit prices obtained from motorola pursuant to the second equipment agreement amendment and the agreement  alternative and more economical means for increasing system capacity  other than constructing additional cell sites and or installing additional base radios  such as use of so called smart antennas  mini cells and software driven and or system design performance enhancements 
many of the foregoing involve elements wholly or partly beyond nextel s control or influence 
see forward looking statements 
other considerations in addition to the factors identified above may significantly affect nextel s decisions to seek additional financing  including general economic conditions  conditions in the telecommunications and or wireless communications industry and the feasibility and attractiveness of structuring particular financings for specific purposes eg  separate capital raising activities with respect to international activities and opportunities 
finally  nextel could obtain significant additional funds in connection with the exercise of outstanding warrants and options  and the amount and timing of receipt of such funds also would play a role in nextel s determinations concerning the need for or attractiveness of other potentially available sources of financing 
as nextel has disclosed previously  full exercise of the options granted to the mccaw investor at the july closing of the mccaw transaction would result in the receipt by nextel of approximately   and  of additional funds prior to july in the years  and  respectively  and full exercise of the warrants initially issued to motorola for  shares of class a common stock would result in the receipt by nextel of approximately  in additional funds  of which would be received in and substantially all of the remainder of which would be received prior to 
finally  proceeds from the exercise by the mccaw investor of its anti dilutive rights to acquire additional nextel equity in connection with certain issuances by nextel of its capital stock and proceeds from the exercise of other warrants and options currently outstanding and held by third parties  including options granted pursuant to the nextel amended and restated incentive equity plan including its predecessor plans and the nextel associates stock purchase plan  may provide other available sources of funding 
the foregoing discussion concerning potential exercise of various third party rights to acquire shares of class a common stock is subject to the qualification that no assurance can be given that any of such rights will be exercised or  if exercised  that the contemplated investment will in fact be consummated 
in the case of the bank credit facility and the vendor credit facility or the additional bank borrowing and or any of the additional borrowings contemplated by the additional motorola financing  if structured successfully  there can be no assurance that the conditions to access such facilities will be met 
to the extent any of the aforementioned proceeds from option and warrant exercises or financing arrangements are not available when required  it will be necessary for nextel to obtain alternate sources of financing to meet its anticipated funding needs 
nextel has had and may in the future have discussions with other parties regarding potential equity investments and debt financing arrangements to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs 
pursuant to the motorola transaction  nextel has agreed  under certain circumstances  not to grant superior governance rights to any third party investor without motorola s consent  which may make securing equity investments more difficult 
motorola consented with respect to the grant of superior governance rights by nextel in connection with the mccaw transaction 
the ability of nextel to incur additional indebtedness including  in certain circumstances  indebtedness incurred under the bank credit agreement and or under the vendor credit facility is and will be limited by the terms of the nextel indentures  the bank credit agreement and the vendor credit agreement
