the company continually reviews its product development activities in an effort to allocate its resources to those product candidates that the company believes have the greatest commercial potential 
factors considered by the company in determining the products to pursue include projected markets and need  potential for regulatory approval and reimbursement under the existing healthcare system  status of its proprietary rights  technical feasibility  expected and known product attributes  and estimated costs to bring the product to market

additions to products under development or changes in products being pursued can substantially and rapidly change the company s funding requirements 
the company expects to incur substantial additional expenditures associated with product development 
the company will seek additional collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners for its non licensed products 
there can be no assurance that such relationships  if any  will successfully reduce the company s funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing may be required  and there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate one or more of its product development programs  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
alliance anticipates that its current capital resources  expected revenues from the ortho license agreement  hmri license agreement  and schering license agreement and investments  will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements for at least the next months

the company s existing san diego facility currently produces material for clinical trials for imagent us 
the company is in the process of expanding its market launch production capacity in san diego for imagent us and is determining whether to expand within existing or additional facilities 
any expansion for any of its products may occur in stages  each of which would require regulatory approval  and product demand could at times exceed supply capacity 
the company has not selected a site or obtained any regulatory approvals for construction of a commercial production facility for its products  nor can there be any assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company cannot predict the amount that it will expend for the construction of such a production facility  and there can be no assurance as to when or whether the fda will determine that such facility complies with good manufacturing practices 
the projected location and construction of a facility will depend on regulatory approvals  product development  and capital resources  among other things 
the ortho license agreement provides an option for ortho to elect to manufacture the emulsion products referred to therein  or to require the company to manufacture such products at a negotiated price 
the hmri license agreement requires the company to manufacture liquivent at its otisville facility for a period of time after market launch and to sell the product to hmri at a negotiated price 
hmri will be responsible for establishing production capacity beyond the maximum capacity of the otisville facility 
the schering license agreement requires the company to manufacture products at its san diego facility for a period of time after market launch at a negotiated price 
schering will be responsible for establishing production capacity beyond the maximum capacity of the san diego facility
