to the extent that these projects are canceled or substantially delayed and not replaced  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s sales and earnings 
approximately of the company s gross revenues were derived from contracts with federal  state  municipal and other governmental agencies 
the termination of any of the company s significant contracts with such governmental agencies  or the failure to obtain either extensions or renewals of certain existing contracts or additional contracts with such governmental agencies  could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings and business 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  overview as discussed in more detail with the comparison of each segment s results  the company s net loss decreased from million during the year ended october  to million during the year ended october  the results for the year reflect decreases in operating margins primarily in psg and research cottrell due to the highly competitive marketplace and increases in selling and marketing expenses primarily psg which have been partially offset by overhead reductions within metcalf eddy  research cottrell and corporate 
sales increased from million to million primarily due to increased service revenues associated with psg s contract with prasa 
at october   the company s backlog was approximately billion and consisted of psg  metcalf eddy and research cottrell 
comparable operating results in the next fiscal year are contingent upon the level and timing of additional contracts in each segment  the achievement of the expected sales level increases  cost control  the execution of expected new projects and those projects in the backlog within the most recent cost estimates as well as the favorable resolution of claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
professional services group operating income was million for the year ended october  and reflects a million decrease from the comparable prior period due to additional selling  general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to growth initiatives which were partially off set by higher gross margins 
the increase in psg s sales is a result of the prasa contract which began september  and has not had a proportional impact on operating income 
although negotiations are progressing slower than previously expected  psg continues to pursue new business opportunities and currently has several proposals pending or under negotiation which if obtained  would significantly increase future sales 
metcalf eddy although sales have remained comparable to the prior year  metcalf eddy s operating income increased by million during the year ended october  the higher operating income was attributable primarily to personnel  facilities and insurance cost reductions which resulted in a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
in addition  estimated favorable pricing adjustments partially offset the impact of unfavorable sales mix to more design build and construction type projects 
research cottrell operating income decreased by 
million during the year ended october  from the comparable prior period 
the changes in operating income reflects the decreases in margin rates in most business units caused by price pressures from highly competitive markets  unfavorable product line mix and project execution 
partially off setting the reduced margins are lower selling  general and administrative expenses of million during the year ended october  primarily at its apcd and kvb operations 
international sales volume has continued to increase by million due to improved market penetration during the aforementioned period  however the higher sales related to international activities were more than off set by lower sales volume in kvb of million during the year ended october  kvb s lower volume  compared with the prior period  is due to the fulfillment of orders for equipment required by utility customers to comply with the clean air act amendments of corporate and other the corporate unallocated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by 
million during the year ended october  due to cost reduction efforts  including personnel related costs and professional fees 
the results for the year compared to the prior year were also favorably impacted by slightly lower financing costs and the favorable resolution of several pending tax issues 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  overview as discussed in more detail with the comparison of each segment s results  the net loss was reduced by million to million during the year ended october  excluding the million impact of unusual charges  losses from discontinued operations and the extraordinary loss  the million improvement of results reflects primarily a million increase in operating income 
this was achieved through better project execution resulting in higher gross margins on stable sales levels within the metcalf eddy and research cottrell segments 
in addition  the june acquisition of psg  cge s water wastewater management subsidiary  and new contract awards resulted in a million sales increase generating higher operating income in the psg segment 
various cost reduction efforts also improved results which are reflected in a million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses despite the effects of the psg acquisition and providing for improved employee fringe benefits including retirement and incentive plans 
backlog levels also increased to over billion due to the million five year contract with prasa to operate  maintain and manage puerto rico s water and wastewater treatment facilities 
professional services group excluding the impact of the million prior period unusual charges and the million proforma operating income impact assuming the june psg acquisition occurred on november   operating income increased during the year ended october  by million 
the increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to new business development which resulted in additional service contracts and cost reductions attained in connection with the consolidation of the metcalf eddy services and professional services group operations 
sales increased by million during the year ended october  the increase during the year is attributable to the proforma sales impact of the psg acquisition million and new business development which resulted in additional service contract revenues million  including revenues of million related to the new prasa contract 
on september   psg initiated operations under its five year contract with prasa to operate  maintain and manage puerto rico s water and wastewater treatment facilities 
this contract is expected to generate annual revenues in excess of million and its profitability thereunder is contingent upon achieving certain incentive revenues and operating efficiencies in which a significant amount is expected to be realized during the later years of the contract 
prasa has the right to cancel the contract after three years 
metcalf eddy excluding the impact of the million prior period unusual charges  operating income increased by million during the year ended october  the improved performance resulted from higher margin sales related to work executed directly by metcalf eddy excluding its sub contractors and other favorable mix impacts as well as improved execution on several projects as a result of obtaining contractual amendments and lower than previously anticipated direct project costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million primarily due to various cost reductions including facility  insurance and administrative overhead related costs partially off set by increased bid and proposal and other related selling costs as well as higher employee fringe benefits 
sales decreased by million during the year ended october  primarily due to changes in pass through sales volume  including its peace shield project  representing direct project costs passed through to the client 
the higher margin sales related to work executed directly by metcalf eddy excluding its sub contractors increased by million during the year 
research cottrell excluding the impact of the million prior period unusual charges  operating income increased by million during the year ended october  the increase resulted from higher gross margins of million primarily due to better execution resulting in the avoidance of additional costs required in the prior year to complete particulate and acid gas control systems  chimneys and emissions monitoring systems million as well as higher gross margins within the international and cooling tower operations primarily due to higher sales volumes and to a lesser extent improved execution million 
also impacting the favorable results were lower selling  general and administrative expenses million due to cost reductions in substantially all product lines primarily within the particulate and acid gas control equipment  emissions monitoring systems and cooling tower product lines which were partially off set with higher international selling activities 
sales increased by million during the year ended october  the increase resulted from higher international sales of particulate and acid gas control systems due to better geographical market penetration in europe and the far east million and higher sales from the cooling tower operations driven by higher orders million 
also contributing to the increase were higher sales of voc control systems due to higher demands driven by the requirements under the clean air act amendments million 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of emission monitors million and chimney products and services million primarily due to the timing of the demand requirements under the clean air act amendments 
in light of improvements in its current market climate and anticipated financial performance  management has decided to retain the company s cooling tower  heat transfer and certain service operations 
the company had previously contemplated selling these businesses and had recorded a charge for the difference between their net carrying value and management s estimate of the anticipated net sales proceeds 
the company is making progress in resolving software issues related to its emissions monitoring systems previously shipped to certain utilities 
the software issues have created problems in collecting receivables due to claims and back charges from certain utilities 
also  the company will continue to incur additional software  warranty and project close out costs in resolving this situation 
management believes that the previously provided reserves for the contemplated divestitures and emissions monitoring operations are adequate in the aggregate  therefore these issues have not had a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of its operations  taken as a whole as of october  and for the year then ended 
corporate and other the corporate unallocated selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization decreased by million during the year ended october  due to cost reduction efforts  including reductions in unallocated promotional and facility related costs 
the company sold its hazardous waste transfer station operations during october and as a result a million gain was recognized and included in other expense  net 
additional charges reflected in the prior year include unusual charges of million  losses from the discontinued asbestos abatement operations million and pamco operations million and an million extraordinary loss on the early retirement of the senior notes with the prudential insurance company of america 
financial condition cash provided by operations for the year ended october  amounted to 
million and was unfavorably impacted by the cash outlays of million for the previously established unusual charge reserves 
the company also utilized million of cash for capital expenditures  investments in environmental treatment facilities and other investment activities including start up costs during the period 
these cash requirements were funded principally through borrowings under the company s credit facilities discussed below and proceeds from the prior year sale of its hazardous waste transfer station operations and one of its emissions monitoring operations 
as a result of the above  net financial debt debt less cash increased by million during the year ended october  during august  the company entered into a seven year million unsecured revolving credit facility with anjou international company anjou credit facility  an affiliated company 
the borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor plus 
in conjunction with this new financing the company reduced its more expensive million senior secured credit facility bank credit facility to million 
as of october   the company s outstanding borrowings under the anjou credit facility totaled million 
the bank credit facility is primarily designed to finance working capital requirements and provide for the issuance of letters of credit  both subject to limitations and secured by a first security interest in substantially all of the assets of the company 
of the total commitment  borrowings are limited to the sum of a percentage of certain eligible receivables  inventories  net property  plant and equipment and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  and bear interest at libor at october   as defined  plus 
or at a defined bank rate approximating prime at october  
the bank credit facility also allows for certain additional borrowings  including  among other things  project financing and foreign borrowing facilities  subject to limitations and contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including  among other things  the maintenance of certain financial ratios  and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  acquisitions  the sale of assets  the payment of dividends and the repurchase of subordinated debt 
in addition  the related agreement requires cge to maintain its support of the company  including  a minimum ownership interest in the company and its right to designate its proportionate share of the company s board of directors as well as the chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
the company compensates cge for its support in an amount equal to 
per annum of the outstanding commitment of its credit facilities million and 
million for the years ended october  and 
under the bank credit facility at october   the company had no outstanding borrowings capacity of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 
the businesses of the company have not historically required significant ongoing capital expenditures 
for the year ended october   and total capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
at october   the company had no material outstanding purchase commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has obtained waivers relating to violations of certain financial covenants under the bank credit facility and other contractual agreements see note 
as of january   the company has borrowed an additional million during fiscal under its credit facilities 
management believes that it will be able to manage its near term cash requirements through its remaining bank credit facility capacity million  current cash balances and working capital reductions 
statement regarding forward looking disclosures statements contained in this report  including management s discussion and analysis  are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which may cause the company s actual operating results to differ materially from the projected amounts 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are risk factors listed from time to time in the company s sec reports including the company s highly competitive marketplace  changes in as well as enforcement levels of federal  state and local environmental legislation and regulations that change demand for a significant portion of the company s services  the ability to obtain new contracts some of which are significant from existing and new clients  the execution of the expected new projects and those projects in backlog within the most recent cost estimates and the favorable resolution of existing claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
inflation the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected in the near term to have  a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
significant portions of the company s sales and the related costs result from contracts that provide for escalation recovery on labor and material costs 
many other contracts are cost plus government contracts 
both types of contracts reduce the company s exposure to the adverse effects of inflation
