item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations information set forth in this report constitutes and includes forward looking information 
the accuracy of such information is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including product mix  the company s ability to obtain or maintain design wins  market conditions in the personal computer and semiconductor industries  product development schedules and other matters 
actual results may differ from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
overview opti has grown since its founding in to become a leading independent volume supplier of multimedia chipsets  including core logic and audio logic chipset products to the personal computer market 
the company s main products are chipsets that provide the core logic functions of a pc 
during  the company shipped more than nine million core logic and audio chipsets to over pc and motherboard manufacturers and add on board manufacturers located primarily in asia and the us compared to net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  
this decrease in sales was attributable to decreased sales of chipsets supporting the company s desktop core logic business segment 
this reduction was partially offset by increases in the company s notebook core logic and audio business segments 
in the company shipped approximately million chipsets as compared to approximately million chipsets in revenue from core logic products were approximately of net sales for as compared to approximately in the remaining of revenue in was from peripheral products audio and graphics 
the mix of revenues within the core logic area has shifted to notebook core logic products which represented approximately of total core logic sales in as compared with approximately in it is likely that the company will experience ongoing shifts in its revenue mix 
no assurances can be given that future revenues will reflect this product mix trend 
the company s declines in its desktop core logic business have been largely due to intel s aggressive push to dominate the desktop core logic market and the company s inability to compete successfully over this period 
this push from intel which began in corresponds to their aggressive marketing of the pentium platform and their successful attempts to control a significant share of the pentium motherboard market  which utilize their own processors and core logic 
gross margin for decreased to approximately of net sales as compared to approximately in this decrease in gross margin for the year was primarily attributable to inventory write downs taken on some of the company s pentium class desktop core logic products  reductions in selling prices for the company s pentium class desktop core logic products  increased overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue  and reductions in selling prices for the company s audio products 
the company is likely to face continued potential inventory risks and adjustments if anticipated sales and shipments do not occur when expected  as in the case of some of its desktop core logic products 
the markets for the company s products are also subject to severe price competition and price declines 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in reducing its product costs rapidly enough to increase it s gross margin level or that further substantial reductions in chipset prices will not result in future losses 
research and development r d expenses for increased approximately to million  compared with million for the increase in research and development expenses from to is primarily related to the company s shift in market focus over the last year as the company has focused more heavily on notebook directed technologies and in the multimedia areas 
the company has invested in technologies which  although not currently productized  may be integrated into future products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased approximately to million  compared with million in this increase in sg a expenses from to was primarily attributable to increased legal expenses related to the class action lawsuit brought against the company  partially offset by a reduction in sales expenses relating to decreased net sales 
net interest and other income for was million as compared to million for interest and other income consists primarily of interest income and has decreased primarily due to lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and lower average interest rates in versus the company s effective tax benefit was for and the company s effective tax rate for was 
the company has relied on future taxable income to benefit its deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded net deferred tax assets of million  reflecting the benefit of million in unrealized net operating loss carryforwards and million in credit carryforwards  which will expire in varying amounts between and realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
the company anticipates an effective tax rate for of approximately 
compared to net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  
this increase in sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of chipsets supporting the microprocessor during the first half of the year  the ramping up of sales of chipsets designed for the pentium microprocessor during the second half of the year  and the sale of audio chipsets 
in the company shipped approximately million chipsets as compared to approximately million chipsets in revenue from products related to core logic were approximately of net sales for as compared to approximately in the remaining of revenue in was from peripheral products audio and graphics 
from through the first half of a large majority of the company s revenues were derived from sales of products for the based pc market 
in the second half of  the pc market almost completely transitioned to pentium class products 
this rapid transition had an adverse effect on the company s operating results in the second half of the year due to a decrease in based revenue  which could not be offset by the company s pentium based products  primarily due to supply constraints on the delivery of those products 
gross margin for decreased to approximately of net sales as compared to approximately in this decrease in gross margin for the year was primarily attributable to activity in the second half of gross margins in the second half of decreased to approximately from approximately in the first half of due to write downs of certain inventories  the costs of ramping up production of the pentium viper m chipset and decreased selling prices in both core logic and audio chipsets 
the markets for the company s products are subject to severe price competition and price declines 
price competition in the audio controller area  for example  had a material adverse effect on gross margins in the second half of as compared with the first half of the year 
research and development r d expenses for increased approximately to million  compared with million for this increase in r d expenses was primarily attributable to additional headcount and their related expenses as well as expenses incurred for initial new product development 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased approximately to million  compared with million in the increase in sg a expenses from to was primarily attributable to additional headcount and their related expenses and increased sales expenses relating to increased net sales 
net interest and other income for was million as compared to million for interest and other income consists primarily of interest income and has increased primarily due to larger average balances of cash and cash equivalents and higher average interest rates in versus the company s effective tax rate was for and liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations through cash generated from operations and an initial public offering of equity in in  the company generated cash from operating activities of million primarily due to reductions in inventories and accounts receivable 
this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and a net loss for the year 
in  the company generated cash from operations of million primarily due to net income and an increase in income taxes payable  offset  in part  by an increase in accounts receivable due to timing differences between shipments that occurred in q as compared with q financing activities provided cash of approximately million and million in  and  respectively  due to proceeds from the sale of stock and proceeds from the sale and leaseback of fixed assets  partially offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations 
the company s investing activities used cash of million and million in and  respectively 
during and the company made capital expenditures  including obligations under capital lease  of approximately million and million  respectively 
these expenditures related primarily to the acquisition of computer equipment and high speed circuit testers for use in the development and testing of chipset products 
in  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement and foundry venture agreement with united microelectronics corporation umc 
under the original terms of the agreements  the company received an immediate supply of wafers from umc and the company committed to invest the equivalent of million in cash for a equity interest in the foundry venture 
the company made a payment of approximately million in january per the original agreement 
the terms of the agreement were subsequently changed so that the company s commitment to invest any additional funds to the venture have been eliminated and the company will retain a prorated share of wafer supplies and equity ownership  based on its reduced total investment 
the company does not have board of director or management representation in the foundry venture 
due to the company s small percentage ownership and little influence on the operations of the foundry venture  the company will continue to account for this investment on the cost basis 
the company has an agreement with a wafer foundry that guarantees minimum volumes of 
micron eight inch wafer capacity and turnkey products through the end of the company  in turn  commits to purchase minimum levels of wafers and turnkey products through this period 
the company s manufacturing plans and expenditure levels are based primarily upon sales forecasts 
typically  the company orders products from foundries pursuant to non cancelable purchase orders on a rolling twelve week basis while its customers generally place product orders approximately four weeks prior to delivery  which orders may be canceled without significant penalty 
the company anticipates that the rate of new orders will vary significantly from month to month 
as a result  backlog can fluctuate significantly 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments do not occur when expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of million 
the company believes that the existing sources of liquidity as well as its million line of credit will satisfy the company s projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the end of
