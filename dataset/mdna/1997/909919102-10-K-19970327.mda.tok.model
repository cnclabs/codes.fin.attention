provision for income taxes income before taxes was  a  or  reduction from total income taxes were  a  or  decrease compared to this disproportionate decrease in taxes  compared to the decrease in pre tax earnings  was due primarily to the bank utilizing the federal statutory bad debt deduction to lower the marginal federal corporate tax rate in  compared to no bad debt deduction in the bank s bad debt deduction reduced federal taxes by approximately  for both and  the marginal montana corporate license tax was 
regulatory developments as required by the firrea  the ots requires that the bank maintain minimum levels of capital under three separate standards see part iv  item notes to consolidated financial statements regulatory capital 
at december   the bank s stockholders equity was million resulting in a capital ratio of approximately 
the bank  as demonstrated by the referenced footnote  is in substantial compliance with  and far exceeds  each of the three minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the balance of the bank s operations are in compliance with the many other firrea provisions  none of which materially restrict the bank s present operational plans 
however  firrea compliance has resulted in higher deposit insurance premiums  increased regulatory compliance expense and reduced fhlb stock dividends 
the regulatory focus on capital as the primary measurement of an institution s strength was reemphasized by the fdicia 
the fdicia introduced a capital framework resulting in the classification of an institution as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized  and critically under capitalized 
other fdicia provisions address individual capital components for the risk from changes in interest rates  concentrations of credit  nontraditional activities  and the capital impact of fair value adjustments associated with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
fdicia provisions also provide for prompt corrective supervisory action  as well as mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions for those institutions failing to meet minimum thresholds 
fdicia provisions significantly expand the scope of operating regulations and widen the application of regulatory guidelines over the operations of federally insured financial institutions 
the bank s fdicia capital rating exceeds well capitalized and its operations are in compliance with fdicia provisions  none of which materially restrict the bank s present operational plans 
however  fdicia compliance has increased the bank s regulatory burden and increased regulatory compliance expense 
legislation over the past year  regulatory and legislative changes have continued to have a dramatic effect on the bank and all other federally regulated depository institutions 
regulatory agencies have become more aggressive in their oversight role and have been implementing a get tough approach to compliance examinations and fair lending law interpretation and enforcement 
the current administration is focusing on consumer compliance issues  in particular fair lending  while congress continues to focus on areas that pose potential safety and soundness problems 
it is doubtful that the complexity of the laws  regulations and guidelines facing the bank  and all other federally regulated depository institutions  will materially abate in the near future 
their impact on the bank has become clear 
the bank will continue to be burdened with regulatory compliance issues that add to the bank s costs of operations  while at the same time providing a distinct competitive advantage to nonregulated competitors 
enacted into law in was legislation providing for a special assessment against fdic saif member institutions which capitalized the saif insurance reserve to the prescribed of insured deposits level 
for the bank  this one time special assessment was  or basis points per of the bank s insured deposit base on march  the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the expense and payment of this  special assessment 
based upon the bank s year end a fdic risk classification  the bank s fdic saif assessment rate  beginning january   will decrease from basis points to basis points per of insured deposits 
most commercial banks  insured under the fdic bank insurance fund bif will  beginning january   be assessed basis points per of insured deposits 
in addition  legislation provides for the merger of the saif and bif insurance funds on january   provided the bank and savings association charters have been merged by that date 
the us treasury department is required to present its common insurance fund recommendations to congress by march  what ultimate impact this new legislation  and other potential changes in federal law regarding interstate banking and branching  glass stegall act revisions  the potential merger of federal regulatory agencies  the continued consolidation of the banking industry  increasing competition from non regulated competitors  and other regulatory changes will have on the bank s operations cannot be predicted at this time 
asset liability management the bank s earnings depend to a large extent on the level of its net interest income 
net interest income depends upon the difference referred to as interest rate spread between the yield on the bank s loan and investment portfolios and interest earning cash balances interest earning assets  and the rates paid on its deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is further affected by the relative amounts of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
when the amount of interest earning assets is less than the amount of interest bearing liabilities  the net yield on interest earning assets is less than the interest rate spread 
should this difference in amounts become too great  the bank could incur a net interest expense despite a positive spread 
one of the primary objectives of the bank s management over the past several years has been to restructure the bank s balance sheet to reduce its vulnerability to changes in interest rates interest rate risk 
savings institutions historically have suffered from a mismatch in the term to maturity of their assets and liabilities  with mortgage loan assets tending to be of a much longer term than deposits  the primary liabilities of savings institutions 
in periods of rising interest rates  this mismatch can render savings institutions vulnerable to increases in costs of funds deposits and borrowings that can outstrip increases in returns on longer term fixed rate loans and investments  resulting in a decrease in positive interest rate spread and lower earnings 
several strategies have been employed by the bank to minimize the mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
for the past several years  the bank has maintained the policy of selling all newly originated long term to year maturity fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
these loans are sold at their outstanding principal balance  which is the prearranged contract purchase price  and therefore  no gain or loss is realized at sale 
the bank promotes the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions 
the bank also emphasizes investment in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
liquidity not utilized for retained loan production has resulted  over the past several years  in an increase in the relative percentage to total assets of shorter term investments versus longer term loans 
in the very low market interest rate and flat yield curve environment of the past few years  no real opportunity existed to extend loan portfolio or investment maturity purchases for a higher yield 
longer term to year fixed rate mortgage loan retention  or greater than year to maturity investment purchases would have provided only a marginal increase in interest income while exposing the bank to significant declines in market values if interest rates rose substantially 
during  the bank decided to retain selected portfolio loans for higher earnings by engaging in increased multi family and commercial estate lending  as well as increased non mortgage commercial and consumer lending 
multi family  all commercial real estate lending and commercial and consumer non mortgage lending is generally shorter term in nature than single family residential lending and  although typically fixed rate  bears higher interest rates 
while the bank believes that its ongoing asset liability management strategies have reduced exposure to interest rate risk  future earnings and stockholders equity will continue to be influenced by changes in levels of market interest rates  competition  and other economic factors beyond the control of the bank s management 
management believes that its conservative short term maturity and adjustable rate investment and loan portfolio policies  enable the bank to minimize portfolio market value declines  and maintain earnings  while providing the liquidity to reprice assets to offset higher market interest rates and increased deposit costs 
interest rate risk exposure irr exposure seeks to establish a methodology to measure the potential for the reduction of earnings and stockholders equity resulting from both lower net interest income nii and lower net portfolio value npv caused by changes in market interest rates 
the earnings of most financial institutions are exposed to irr because typically a larger dollar amount of liabilities primarily deposits reprice faster than do loans  investments  or other interest earning assets 
therefore  when interest rates rise  the cost of deposits reprice and often do so more rapidly than the yield on interest earning assets  thereby reducing nii 
typically  a financial institution s interest earning assets are of a longer duration or term than its interest bearing liabilities  and therefore net portfolio value  ie the present value of all expected cash flows from assets less the present value of all expected cash flows from liabilities will decline as interest rates rise 
npv thus provides a leading indicator of future potential changes in both nii and stockholders equity 
given that irr  is the most important component of the bank s earnings  and given ots mandates including thrift bulletin no 
 the bank has established a formal written board of director s approved irr policy 
the bank has also established an asset liability management committee and an investment committee which meets at least quarterly to review and report in writing to the bank s board of directors management s efforts to minimize irr 
irr exposure measurement the most effective method of measuring irr is via asset liability computer simulation 
inputting comprehensive detailed raw data concerning assets and liabilities  along with a variety of assumptions  forecasts  and pricing changes  simulation compares the effects of a variety of interest rate environments on an institution s nii and npv 
while the bank has the option of buying  and producing its own asset liability program  the problems with such computer models are four fold high cost  rapid obsolescence as requirements and data change over time  extremely labor intensive  and most importantly  the product derived is only as good as the time available to devote to the assumptions and forecasts inputted 
the bank s management has determined that the cost versus benefit to be derived from an in house model is not worth the manpower and software costs involved 
also given the bank s asset size  less than million the bank falls under an ots exemption that allows utilization of an asset liability computer simulation program prepared and distributed by the ots 
the ots thrift financial report includes schedule cmr which provides detailed information about the balances  interest rates  repricing  and maturity characteristics of the bank s financial instruments 
by utilizing the bank s provided schedule cmr data  the ots runs computer simulations net portfolio value model utilizing ots assumptions 
received quarterly is an interest rate risk exposure report detailing the bank s interest rate sensitivity under various instantaneous changes in interest rates 
this ots computer simulation report displays first the present value of the bank s total assets and net portfolio value with no change in rates  then displays the changes expected to occur with four instantaneous basis point increases and four instantaneous basis point decreases in interest rates 
the bank s board of directors  per ots requirements  has established the following maximum precentage changes  or policy limits for npv change net portfolio value instantaneous basis point change in rates npv the following table demonstrates the bank s december  npv amount  change  and change for the four instantaneous increases and the four instantaneous decreases in interest rates dollars in thousands net portfolio value npv change in rates amount change change bp   bp   bp  bp  bp  bp  bp  bp  the following table demonstrates the bank s december  present value pv of total assets  npv ratio  and basis point change for the four instantaneous increases and the four instantaneous decreases in interest rates dollars in thousands change in rates pv of total assets npv ratio basis point change bp  bp bp  bp bp  bp bp  bp bp  bp bp  bp bp  bp bp  bp the ots has also established an irr capital component

as of december  and december   the bank s liquidity ratios were and  respectively 
the same regulations also require the bank to maintain a short term liquid assets ratio equal to at least of its average daily balance of net withdrawable deposits and borrowings payable in one year or less 
as of december  and  the bank s short term liquid asset ratios were and  respectively 
during the fiscal years and  the bank consistently maintained both ratios far in excess of regulatory requirements 
the bank s liquidity investments for regulatory purposes were approximately million at december   and consisted primarily of cash  interest earning bank accounts  fhlb certificates of deposit  us treasuries and us government agencies with maturities of five years or less 
the primary sources of funds are deposits  fhlb borrowings  loan and mortgage backed securities repayments  proceeds from loan sales  investment securities interest payments and maturities  and net operating revenues 
the principal uses of funds are loan originations  mortgage backed securities and other investment securities purchases  maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals  repayment of fhlb borrowings  cash dividends  maintaining liquidity and meeting operating expenses

in addition  during  the mix of investing activities changed with increased loans originated for  and retained for portfolio in compared to or the bank can borrow from the fhlb in an amount not to exceed of assets 
the company currently has no material commitments for loan fundings or other expenditures 
at december   the company s stockholders equity was approximately million  or over of assets 
additionally  the bank s regulatory capital is over million more than the highest of three regulatory capital standards required by federal regulations 
the company s current level of capital and liquidity provides it with the opportunity to manage its balance sheet with a great deal of flexibility while still complying with regulatory requirements 
this operating advantage has provided management with the ability to restructure its balance sheet over the past several years 
as a result  the bank has become more profitable and has better matched its assets and liabilities to react to and take advantage of changes in market conditions 
management believes that the present facilities and equipment required to conduct its business are more than adequate for the foreseeable future 
effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historic dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services
