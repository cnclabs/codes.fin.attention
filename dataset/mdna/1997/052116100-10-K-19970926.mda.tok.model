the following table sets forth the principal components of the company s revenues years ended june  product revenue    service and other revenue    total revenues 
   product revenue increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were attributable to higher average system prices and increased sales of upgrades to the company s installed base

sales to aol accounted for of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  additionally  sales to fuji xerox accounted for of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  no other customer accounted for or more of total revenues for any of the three years in the period ended june  in addition to direct purchases from the company  intel or its affiliates have from time to time made significant purchases of the company s products through indirect channels 
intel  aol and fuji xerox are not obligated to purchase any minimum level of products from the company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that sales of products and services to intel  aol  and fuji xerox will not decline  either in absolute dollar amounts or as a percentage of total revenues  in future periods and that any such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
gross margin the company s gross margin was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
costs of revenues include material costs  manufacturing and service overhead costs  installation and warranty expenses  obsolescence  the cost of spare parts and other related costs 
the decrease in gross margins in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to pricing on systems sales and lower margins on service 
this was partially offset by a significant increase in software revenue 
the improvement in margin in fiscal was attributable to engineering related cost reductions in successive new product designs  increased production volumes  and improved manufacturing and service related efficiencies 
operating expenses marketing and sales expenses increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and were  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars is the result of additional headcount in the north american direct sales operations and the growth of direct sales operations of the company s international subsidiaries 
research and development expenses  net of capitalized software development costs  increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in net research and development expenses both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the addition of employees and related project costs to support the company s new product development efforts 
the decrease in net research and development as a percent of total revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal relates primarily to the increase in revenues 
software development expenses have been accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 under which the company is required to capitalize software development costs after technological feasibility is established 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company initiated several software development projects which resulted in the capitalization of million in fiscal and million in fiscal no amounts were capitalized in fiscal the amount of capitalized software development costs in any given period may vary depending on the exact nature of the development performed 
the company believes that in order to remain competitive  it will need to continue to make substantial investments in new and enhanced products  and anticipates that research and development expenses will increase in both absolute amounts and as a percentage of total revenues from current levels 
general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
although general and administrative expenses remained generally flat in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the company anticipates that the cost of expanding infrastructure including new facilities will increase in fiscal to support the company s growth 
on june   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of alphatronix  inc alphatronix  a market leader in the development and marketing of open systems based storage management solutions for a total purchase price of million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was million and million  respectively 
in addition  million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no probable alternative future uses  which the company expensed at the date of the acquisition as a one time non recurring charge 
the remainder of the purchase price  million  was allocated to goodwill and will be amortized over five years on a straight line basis 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
alphatronix s in process r d projects relate primarily to developing significant enhancements to the current product offering as well as introducing advanced new products 
the incomplete projects include a new user interface  enterprise management support  a hierarchical storage management function  database journalizing  database insertion  differential dataset recovery  and on demand restore ability 
given the uniqueness of the tasks and the technologies involved  alternative future uses for these projects  apart from the objectives and economies of the projects for which they are intended  do not exist 
the company believes that the efforts to complete the acquired in process r d projects will consist of internally staffed engineering costs over the next one to two years 
these costs are estimated to be approximately  to complete the r d 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in making commercially viable products from the alphatronix research and development 
other income other income and expense resulted in income of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
other income and expense includes interest income  interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses 
interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily relates to an increase in the cash and short term investments balances 
provision for income taxes as of june   the company had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million 
management has determined  based on the company s history of prior operating earnings and its expectations for future years  that the deferred tax asset is realizable 
however  no assurances can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated in future years for the utilization of the deferred tax asset 
the provision for income taxes was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  representing effective tax rates of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to the fact that the company will not receive any tax benefits related to the write off of in process research and development expenses of approximately million resulting from the acquisition of alphatronix

quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial information for the company s last eight quarters 
this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and in management s opinion reflects all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
based on the company s operating history and factors that may cause fluctuations in the quarterly results  quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
although the company s revenues are not generally seasonal in nature  the company has experienced decreases in first quarter revenue versus the preceding fourth quarter which is believed to result primarily from the capital asset purchase cycle of the company s customers 
the level of the company s operating expenses is partially based on its expectations of future revenue 
the company s results of operations may be adversely affected if revenue does not materialize in a period as expected 
since expense levels are usually committed in advance of revenues and because only a small portion of expenses vary with revenue  the company s net income may be impacted significantly by lower revenue 
the company s revenue increased each quarter in fiscal as compared to the equivalent quarter in the prior year 
this increase was due principally to increased sales volume or higher average selling prices of the company s products

factors that may affect future results the last two sentences in the sixth paragraph of the section entitled the company in part i  the first sentence in the fourth paragraph of the section entitled distribution in part i  the last sentence in the second paragraph of the section entitled operating expenses in part ii  the second sentence of the first paragraph of the section entitled provision for income taxes in part ii  the third sentence of the second paragraph under the section entitled liquidity and capital resources in part ii and the last sentence of the fourth paragraph under the section entitled liquidity and capital resources in part ii contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the company may also make oral and written forward looking statements from time to time 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below 
the company undertakes no obligation to update such information 
potential significant fluctuations in quarterly results the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a combination of factors 
these factors include the timing of orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold 
the company generally realizes higher gross margins on sales of systems to end users and on single system sales than on systems sold through distributors and oems and on multiple system sales 
in addition  given the company s focus on highly configured enterprise class systems  the loss or delay in a given quarter of a relatively limited number of system sales could adversely effect the company s revenues 
historically  the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of any given quarter 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of revenues could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
intensely competitive market the market for the company s products is intensely competitive 
the company experiences substantial competition  principally from sun microsystems  hewlett packard company and silicon graphics  inc also  emc corporation has recently introduced proprietary products to provide network attached storage 
in addition  smaller companies such as network appliance  inc have introduced products at the low end of the company s target markets 
most of the company s competitors are better known and have substantially greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than the company 
while the company believes that the price performance characteristics of its products are competitive  price competition in the markets for the company s products is intense 
any material reduction in the price of the company s products without corresponding decreases in manufacturing costs and increases in unit volume would negatively affect gross margins which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of product upgrades to its installed base  including additional processors  and memory and disk and tape drives 
increased competition for the company s products that result in lower product sales could also adversely impact the company s upgrade sales 
in addition  decisions by customers not to increase capacity to their current systems could adversely impact the company s revenues and results of operations 
the company s ability to maintain its competitive position will depend  among other factors  upon its success in anticipating industry trends  investing in product research and development  developing new products with improved price performance characteristics and effectively managing the introduction of new products into targeted markets 
dependence on key personnel competition for employees with highly technical  management and other skills is intense in the computer industry and is particularly intense in the san francisco bay area 
the company has in the past encountered some difficulties in fulfilling its hiring needs and retaining key employees in this employment market  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring and retaining qualified employees in the future 
the company s failure to retain the services of key personnel or to attract additional qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
software product risks with the release of its driveguard tm and fastbackup tm software products along with current software products serverguard tm and dataguard tm  the company now markets software products in addition to its line of network file servers 
the company also expects to release enhancements and new features for these products from time to time 
although the company performs extensive testing prior to releasing software products  such products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first released 
these may not be discovered until the product has been used by customers in different application environments 
failure to discover product deficiencies or bugs could delay product introductions  require design modifications to previously shipped products  cause unfavorable publicity or negatively impact system shipments  any of which could result in a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new products new product introductions by the company or its competitors carry the risk that customers could delay or cancel orders for existing products pending shipment of the new products 
the company s strategy is to continue to introduce new products and upgrades to existing products on an ongoing basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of these products and enhancements or that these new products and enhancements will adequately address market requirements and achieve market acceptance 
any delays in the launch or availability of new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on established standards the rapid emergence of new or alternate standards such as nt which replace or diminish the market acceptance of unix operating systems or nfs  on which the company s products are currently based  could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations unless the company is able to incorporate any such standards in the company s products in a timely manner 
dependence on certain customers distributors for fiscal year and  direct sales of products and services to intel represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
in addition to direct purchases from the company  intel or its affiliates have from time to time made significant purchases of the company s products through indirect channels 
also in fiscal year  direct sales of products and services to aol represented approximately of the company s revenues 
for fiscal year  sales to fuji xerox  the company s non exclusive master value added distributor in japan  represented approximately of the company s revenues 
intel  aol and fuji xerox are not obligated to purchase any minimum level of products from the company 
a significant reduction in product sales to intel  aol or fuji xerox would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on certain suppliers certain of the company s products contain critical components supplied by a single or a limited number of third parties 
while the company has an inventory of these critical components  any significant or prolonged shortage of these components or the failure of the third party suppliers to maintain or enhance these components could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
risks of international sales  european and japanese market risks during fiscal year and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were derived from markets outside of north america 
the company expects that sales to the pacific rim and europe will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
there can be no assurance that the company s pacific rim or european operations will continue to be successful 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from localized economic and market conditions 
in addition  the company s international business may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency restrictions as well as by risks such as trade restrictions  increases in tariff and freight rates and difficulties in obtaining necessary export licenses and meeting appropriate local regulatory standards 
for example  the company has had to modify its products in minor respects in japan to comply with local electromagnetic emissions standards  and must also comply with corresponding european economic community standards 
in marketing its products to the european economic community  the company also must face the challenges posed by a fragmented market complicated by local distribution channels and local cultural considerations 
for international sales  the company has largely relied on distributors or oems  most of who are entitled to carry products of the company s competitors 
intellectual property and proprietary rights  pending litigation the company currently relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its hardware and software products 
the company currently holds six united states patents and has filed applications for additional patents 
the company has also filed applications for counterpart patents in foreign countries  including japan 
there can be no assurance that the company s present or future competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s patent applications will result in issued patents  or that the company s issued patents will be upheld if challenged 
additionally  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future projects or that any such assertions may not require the company to refrain from the sale of its products  enter into royalty arrangements or undertake costly litigation 
the company s adherence to industry standards with respect to its products limits the company s opportunities to provide proprietary features which may be protected 
in addition  the laws of various countries in which the company s products may be sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims which arise in the normal course of business 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate dispositions of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position  liquidity or results of operations of the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million as of june   compared to june   and increased million as of june   compared to june  the company generated approximately million  million and million in cash from operating activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase of cash from operating activities in each year was due primarily to an increase in net income in each year 
the company s principal investing activities consisted in the purchase of property and equipment which were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily for leasehold improvements  equipment for research and development  manufacturing test equipment  office equipment and spare parts to support customer service contracts 
the company currently anticipates capital expenditures of approximately to million in fiscal year  primarily for leasehold improvements  engineering  manufacturing and office equipment and spare parts support 
the company also used cash of million  million and million for short term investments in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s primary financing activities included proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to employee benefit plans of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the company made principal payments on capital leases of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of june   working capital was million as compared with million as of june  the company anticipates that its current cash and short term investment balances and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through fiscal
