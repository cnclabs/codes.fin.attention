overview redwood trust  inc is a mortgage finance company which acquires mortgages and seeks to earn spread income while holding and managing the mortgages to maturity 
the company uses both its equity and borrowed funds to acquire mortgages 
the company s source of earnings is net interest income  or the interest income earned on mortgages less interest expense paid on borrowed funds and hedging costs 
the company believes its primary competitors are other financial institutions  such as banks and savings and loan institutions  which seek to earn spread income from managing mortgage assets 
compared to most of its competitors  the company believes it benefits from a lower cost of operations and from its status as a real estate investment trust reit 
as a reit  the company does not pay corporate federal income taxes so long as the company pays out as dividends an amount equal to at least of its taxable income and satisfies certain other conditions 
the company has sought to structure its business to achieve operational efficiencies and to minimize fixed costs 
instead of maintaining an in house mortgage origination staff  the company acquires mortgage assets from mortgage origination companies  savings and loans  banks and from the secondary mortgage market 
the company out sources mortgage servicing functions 
rather than build a retail branch banking system to gather deposits which would require the company to obtain a bank or savings and loan charter  pay taxes and be regulated  the company accesses borrowed funds in the capital markets 
this strategy enables the company to keep its operating costs low 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s operating expenses to assets ratio was and its efficiency ratio operating expenses to net interest income was 
as of december  all of the company s mortgage assets consisted of adjustable rate  first lien mortgages on single family properties or mortgage securities evidencing an interest in such mortgages 
in the future the company may acquire fixed rate single family mortgage loans as well as mortgage loans on multi family or commercial properties 
the company acquires individual whole mortgage loans of total mortgage assets as of december   mortgage securities evidencing an interest in pools of mortgage loans which have been fully insured against credit losses by one of the government sponsored mortgage entities such as gnma  fhlmc and fnma of total  mortgage securities which have partial private sector credit enhancement through insurance  subordination  or other means sufficient to warrant an investment grade credit rating from one of the nationally recognized credit rating firms of total  and mortgage securities which are subordinated and have higher levels of credit risk such that they have received a rating below bbb of total 
the average credit rating equivalent of the company s mortgage assets is aa 
the company is an a quality mortgage lending company the company does not own mortgages originated to b  c  or d quality origination or documentation standards except in limited circumstances when the company has a degree of credit protection sufficient to eliminate most of the potential credit risk from such loans 
the company seeks to acquire a quality single family mortgage assets consisting of jumbo mortgages which  in general  have loan balances greater than  because of their size  these jumbo loans are not eligible to be acquired or guaranteed by the government sponsored mortgage entities 
the company also acquires fnma and fhlmc mortgage securities and smaller balance a quality whole loans when such acquisitions are deemed attractive by management 
as of december   of the whole mortgage loans owned by the company were secured by single family residential properties located in california 
in addition  of the properties underlying the mortgage pools in which the company owned an interest that was rated less than aa were located in california 
management believes that the economy and the trend of residential housing values in california were generally stable to improving in the coupon rate the company earns on its adjustable rate mortgage assets of all mortgage assets as of december  increases or falls in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates  as does the rate the company pays on its borrowings 
the coupon rate on each mortgage generally adjusts on a one  six or twelve month cycle  the average term to next adjustment for all of the company s mortgage assets was five months as of december  borrowings have maturities ranging from one to twelve months  the average term to next adjustment for borrowings was approximately two months as of december  the company s interest rate agreement hedging program is designed to reduce the impact of negative effects that could occur in a rising interest rate environment as a result of mismatches between the adjustment dates of the company s assets and liabilities 
such mismatches averaged three months at december  changes in the coupon rates earned on the company s mortgages are limited by periodic and lifetime caps  the company s hedging program also seeks to mitigate the negative effects such mortgage coupon caps may have on spread income should short term interest rates increase rapidly 
because the company s adjustable rate earning assets exceed its liabilities  the company believes that rising short term interest rates may lead to higher net earnings after a lag period  all other factors being equal 
similarly  falling short term interest rates may lead to reduced net earnings after a lag period 
the company seeks to generate secular growth in earnings and dividends per share in a variety of ways  including through i issuing new equity and increasing the size of the balance sheet when opportunities in the mortgage market are likely to allow growth in earnings per share  ii seeking to improve productivity by increasing the size of the balance sheet at a rate faster than operating expenses increase  iii changing the mix of mortgage asset types on the balance sheet in an effort to improve risk adjusted returns  iv seeking to benefit by an increased market value of assets and lower borrowing costs should mortgage asset quality improve with seasoning  mortgage principal repayments  and improvements in real estate markets and the general economy  and v increasing the efficiency with which the company utilizes its equity capital over time by increasing the company s use of debt when prudent and by issuing subordinated debt  preferred stock or other forms of debt and equity 
the company has grown rapidly by issuing new capital and acquiring new mortgage assets 
while the company believes such growth has significantly increased its long term earnings per share potential  the near term effect has been a reduction in reported earnings per share as compared to what earnings likely would have been without such growth 
the company intends to continue to pursue additional growth in the future when management believes that growth is likely to be additive to earnings per share potential 
results of operations fourth quarter vs 
fourth quarter total net income total net income  as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap  to common and preferred shareholders increased by  from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of total net income available to common shareholders after preferred dividends increased by  from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of growth in total net income was driven primarily by growth in average assets 
from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  average assets grew by to billion  interest income revenue grew by to million  net interest income grew by to million  credit provision expenses rose by to million and operating expenses grew by to million 
average total equity grew by to million 
growth in revenues and net interest income have lagged average asset growth somewhat as the company has changed its asset mix towards lower credit risk assets with narrower spreads and as the company has utilized a higher percentage of debt rather than equity to fund its mortgage assets 
credit provision expenses have not increased pro rata with growth in average assets as the company has not added to its portfolio of securitized mortgages rated less than aa since on average  the company has moved towards an asset mix that  through december   has required a lower average level of credit provisions 
growth in operating expenses has lagged asset growth as the company has become more efficient in its operations

as a reit  the company deducts its dividend distributions from taxable income and is required to pay federal taxes on any remaining undistributed taxable income 
since the company intends to distribute of its taxable income as dividends and as a reit is required to distribute at least  the company is not generally subject to federal income tax 
as a result of these reit issues  the company s total dividends will reflect its taxable income rather than its total net gaap income 
taxable income differs from gaap because i taxable income credit expense equals actual credit losses rather than credit provisions actual credit losses through december  have been minor  ii amortization methods differ for discount that has been created when mortgages have been acquired at a price below principal value  iii dividend equivalent rights which accrue on some stock options are deducted from gaap income as an operating expense but are not deducted from taxable income  and iv operating expenses differ in certain other aspects 
management believes taxable income is a closer approximation of current cash flow generation than is gaap income 
taxable income before preferred dividends in the fourth quarter of was million and was higher than gaap net income before preferred dividends of million during the same period 
the table below presents the major differences between gaap and taxable income for the company 
table taxable income taxable operating gaap expenses taxable taxable taxable taxable net income taxable and income income income income before credit mortgage before after return return preferred expense amortization preferred preferred on common on total dividends differences differences dividends dividends equity equity dollars in thousands fiscal  quarter  quarter  quarter    quarter     quarter     quarter     quarter     quarter    dividends the company declared a dividend of per common share in the fourth quarter of resulting in a total dividend distribution including preferred dividends of million  or of taxable income earned during the quarter 
through december   cumulative taxable income has exceeded cumulative dividends paid or declared by million  the company intends to distribute this excess taxable income as part of the company s march dividend 
the fourth quarter common stock dividend of per share represented a slight increase over the per common share declared in the third quarter of and an increase of over the declared for the fourth quarter of dividend per share growth from the third to the fourth quarter of did not mirror the increase in total taxable income after preferred dividend from million to million due to a large increase in common shares eligible to receive a dividend at year end stemming from the november common stock offering of  shares and warrant exercises leading to the issuance of  shares of common stock in december 
the company s  shares of class b preferred stock receive a quarterly dividend of per share or  if greater  the common stock dividend

over the same period  the company s cost of funds declined by basis points from to and the company s cost of hedging declined by basis points from to 
as a result of these changes  the spread the company earned between the yield on its assets and its cost of borrowed funds and hedging declined from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the asset mix of the company  and therefore the earning asset yield and the spread the company earned  changed from to during  the company ceased the acquisition of higher yielding  wider spread  higher credit risk assets such as mortgage securities rated below aa and focused on the acquisition of lower yielding  narrower spread  lower credit risk assets such as high quality whole loans and mortgage securities rated aaa and aa 
a competitive return on equity can be achieved by the company on these new higher quality assets  despite a lower yield and a narrower interest rate spread  as the company makes a smaller internal capital allocation to these assets and expenses a lower level of credit provisions 
rapid asset growth has also led  on a temporary basis  to lower asset yields and a narrower spread for the company 
newly acquired adjustable rate mortgages typically have lower initial mortgage coupon rates than the company earns on its existing mortgage portfolio 
typically the coupon rates on newly acquired mortgages are lower than average for six to twelve months 
thus the company s average spread has been narrower on a temporary basis during periods of rapid balance sheet growth 
table earning asset yield and interest rate spread average effect of coupon net rate average average discount net earning interest during cost coupon premium mortgage cash asset cost of cost of rate period basis yield amortization yield yield yield funds hedging spread fiscal  quarter  quarter  quarter  quarter  quarter  quarter  quarter  quarter the company s earning asset yield and spread were also diminished in due to an increase in the rate of mortgage principal repayments on those assets for which the company paid a premium price 
as shown in table  the company wrote off its premium balances at an annual rate of in the fourth quarter of and in the fourth quarter of the company writes off premium as an amortization expense at a rate equal to or greater than the actual monthly rate of principal repayment on those assets  so increases in principal repayment rates cause an increase in amortization expense 
the mortgages the company acquired at a discount also had rapid rates of mortgage principal repayment  the company does not amortize its discount balances into income at a correspondingly rapid rate  however  as the discount balance acts as a form of credit reserve for these assets

mortgage prices rose more than would usually be expected given changes in interest rates 
management believes mortgage prices have risen due to strong demand from banks  savings and loans  and other financial institutions stemming from a continued state of over capitalization  an increase in the prices of financial assets in general  a decrease in interest rate volatility  and other factors 
the effect on the company s earnings of this increase in mortgage prices for new assets was offset to some degree by a reduced cost of hedging 
at the same time that the company s spread has narrowed for a variety of reasons  some of which are temporary  the company has significantly improved its operating and capital efficiencies 
these efficiencies have allowed the company to increase return on equity over this period despite lower yields and spreads 
net interest income net interest income  or interest income revenues less the cost of funds and hedging  increased from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of the net interest margin net interest income divided by assets declined from to over this period as the company funded an increasing percentage of its assets with debt rather than equity 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s average equity to assets ratio was  in the fourth quarter of  the average equity to assets ratio was 
as a result of this increase in leverage utilization and capital efficiency  net interest income as a percentage of equity increased from to 
it is this ratio  rather than net interest margin  which the company seeks to maximize with its balance sheet management program while at the same time seeking to manage risk 
the company was able to increase its asset size relative to its equity base  and thus increase net interest income profitability  as it reduced its average internal capital allocation due to reductions in credit and liquidity risk on the balance sheet and as the company more efficiently matched the timing of inflows of capital and mortgage asset acquisitions so that it was less under leveraged on average as compared to its target size 
in the fourth quarter of  the actual average equity to assets ratio of greatly exceeded the target equity to asset ratio of 
the average balance sheet capacity utilization during that period was 
in the fourth quarter of  average balance sheet capacity utilization was  the average equity to assets ratio was and the target ratio was 
management expects  based on market conditions as of december   that the company may seek to continue to reduce its balance sheet risks and  in a corresponding manner  reduce its target equity to assets ratio 
in addition  the company hopes to further improve its capital efficiency and balance sheet capacity utilization by seeking to make further improvements in matching the timing of inflows of capital with the acquisition of mortgage assets 
if these goals can be achieved  management believes that the net interest margin would continue to decline but that net interest income as a percentage of equity might increase 
two other significant factors  discussed in earning asset yield and interest rate spread  contributed to changes in the net interest margin and net interest income as a percentage of equity 
the decline in the earning asset yield from to as a result of declining interest rates and other factors reduced earnings on that portion of the balance sheet which was funded directly with equity capital 
the negative effect of this drop in earning asset yield on return on equity was approximately 
in addition  the company s interest rate spread decreased  although this effect was overwhelmed by the positive effect of the greater use of leverage which was made possible by the shift in asset mix towards lower risk  narrower spread mortgage assets 
the net effect of having a greater amount of spread funded assets but at narrower spreads can be seen in table by looking at the spread lending contribution to return on equity interest rate spread times the ratio of spread funded assets to equity 
the spread lending contribution to return on equity increased from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the remainder of the net interest income return on equity not contributed by spread lending was contributed by mortgage assets funded directly with equity

the company expects realized credit losses to increase in the company reduced reported net income by  in the fourth quarter of to provide for possible future credit losses 
the credit provision in the fourth quarter of was  in each case the bulk of these provisions related to potential future credit losses in the company s portfolio of securitized mortgages rated below bbb 
as shown in table below  credit provisions declined as a percentage of assets and equity from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its policy regarding credit provisions for whole loans 
formerly  the company took a provision for a quality whole loans at the time of acquisition equal to of the principal value of the mortgages 
such provisions were minor in the fourth quarter of as the volume of whole loan acquisitions in that quarter was small 
in the fourth quarter of  the company started taking whole loan credit provisions on an on going  rather than a one time  basis in order to avoid large unwarranted swings in reported income that could be caused by acquisitions of bulk loan portfolios 
under the new policy  the company will take on going credit provisions at an annual rate of of the principal value of a quality whole loans 
since most whole loan acquisitions in the fourth quarter of closed at the end of december  whole loan provisions were minor in that quarter as well

after giving effect to this mortgage insurance  the average original ltv ratio of the company s whole loans was at december  the ratio of the current loan balance to original home value is lower than the original ltv ratios detailed here due to pay downs of mortgage principal over time 
the company defines non performing assets npas as whole loans which are delinquent more than days  in foreclosure or real estate owned reo 
as of december   the company s npas were million  with six loans in foreclosure and one real estate owned 
at december  the company had no non performing assets 
through december   the company has experienced no actual whole loan credit losses 
management expects actual credit losses to occur in and eventually expects its whole loan credit losses to mirror the experience of the a quality single family residential mortgage market as a whole 
the company is building a reserve for potential future credit losses  see credit reserves 
securitized mortgages rated aaa to bbb at december   of the company s mortgage assets were securitized interests in pools of single family mortgage loans which had an investment grade credit rating of aaa through bbb from one or more of the nationally recognized rating agencies  or  if not rated  had equivalent credit quality in the view of management 
at december   these types of mortgage securities represented of the company s mortgage assets 
each of these investment grade mortgage securities has credit enhancement from a third party which provides the company with full or partial protection from credit losses in addition to the protection afforded by the value of the properties underlying the individual mortgages and any primary mortgage insurance on individual loans 
given the quality of the mortgage loans in these pools and the levels of additional credit enhancement  management believes the level of credit risk for these mortgage assets is low 
in the event  however  that credit losses in these pools exhaust the credit enhancement or in the event of default of fnma  fhlmc or another third party guarantor  credit losses to the company could result 
through december   the company has experienced no actual credit losses from these mortgage assets 
securitized mortgages rated below bbb in and  the company acquired a limited amount of securitized mortgage assets with a credit rating equivalent of less than bbb 
a substantial majority of the mortgages in the pools underlying these securities were underwritten to a quality standards 
the company may acquire additional such assets when management believes that the cash flow and return on average equity over the life of the asset  net of expected credit losses  will be attractive 
these assets have high potential yields but also have higher levels of credit risk  are costly to finance and require a large allocation of capital under the company s risk adjusted capital system 
such assets had an estimated bid side market value at december  of million 
these assets may be highly beneficial to the company over their life  although any such benefits are likely to be realized chiefly in later years 
future benefits may include possible credit rating upgrades and market value improvements as the mortgage interests senior to the company s position prepay 
this would lead to lower borrowing costs  an expanded equity base for the company and a lower internal risk adjusted capital allocation 
another potential benefit is the eventual return of principal net of credit losses which was purchased at a discount 
this would tend to increase the company s earnings as it amortizes these discount balances into income 
approximately of the company s securitized assets with a credit rating equivalent below bbb are credit enhanced to some degree 
these assets are credit enhanced to a lesser degree than higher rated assets 
credit losses will not be incurred by the company on these assets until total credit losses in the related mortgage pool exhaust the credit enhancement 
at that point  however  the rate of loss to the company s interest is likely to be significant as these interests are subordinated to and provide credit enhancement for other  more senior  interests issued from the same mortgage pool 
in effect  the company is providing a form of mortgage credit insurance to the senior interests in each of these pools and therefore the company would bear the credit risk of the entire pool which would be many times the size of the company s interest in the event that the credit enhancement junior to the company s interest is exhausted 
total potential credit losses to the company are limited to the company s cost basis in these assets 
in some of the mortgage pools underlying these securities  delinquencies currently exceed management s original expectations 
delinquency levels in most of these pools appeared to have stabilized during actual pool credit losses which have reduced the credit enhancement protection to the company s below bbb rated interests have occurred  but most of the aggregate credit enhancement in these pools that existed at the time of acquisition was still intact at december  the company has experienced no credit losses from these credit enhanced assets in   or in  the company acquired two first loss assets 
these are subordinated interests with no credit enhancement 
at december   the estimated market value of these assets approximated their historical amortized cost of million  at december   the estimated market value was million 
all credit losses in the related pools of mortgages will reduce the principal value of these first loss assets and will be recognized as an actual credit loss by the company 
as the company s cost basis in its first loss assets is low relative to the mortgage principal value  the company s realized credit loss will equal only of the principal value of any mortgage credit losses in the pools 
the limit of the company s potential credit losses on these assets is equal to the amortized cost of million 
total actual credit losses realized by the company on these first loss assets were  in and  in credit reserves the company has been building a credit reserve for future potential credit losses through taking quarterly credit provisions 
these credit provisions reduce reported gaap earnings but only future actual credit losses will reduce taxable earnings and dividends 
the first step the company takes in its on going review of the adequacy of its credit reserve is to assess potential credit risk arising from whole loans and loans in the mortgage pools underlying the company s securitized mortgage assets which are seriously delinquent days delinquent  foreclosures and real estate owned 
future credit losses from these loans will depend on the number of these loans actually defaulting  the loss severity experienced on default of the loan net of recoveries from any individual loan private mortgage insurance  the level of credit enhancement at the pool level  and the company s amortized cost basis in that asset 
the table below shows the credit losses that could be incurred by the company if all the seriously delinquent mortgage loans in the company s whole loan and mortgage securities portfolios at december  were to default and result in a loss 
for example  if these seriously delinquent loans were to default and the loss severity experienced was of the loan balance  credit losses to the company would be  of the current credit reserve 
if such losses happen  most of them would likely occur over the next twelve months during which time the company will continue to take credit provisions and build its reserve 
the amount of actual credit losses that will be incurred from these loans is unknown 
this table below addresses the potential credit risk arising from serious delinquencies as of december  only  it does not purport to reflect potential losses that may occur over the life of these assets 
in order to complete the evaluation of the adequacy of its reserve levels  the company also considers additional credit losses that may arise from future delinquencies 
see also results of operations  credit provisions

to the extent such losses are not incurred  this million discount will be amortized into the company s reported income over time as the mortgage principal of these assets pay down 
due to their subordinated status  many of these below bbb rated assets are not currently receiving significant principal pay downs  unless impacted by poor credit performance  the company should start to receive a reasonable flow of principal pay downs from these assets in three to ten years and thus may be able to accelerate its amortization of its discount balances into income 
interest rate agreements the company s interest rate agreements had a historical amortized cost basis of million at december  and million at december  there is a risk that the counter parties to the interest rate agreements will not be able to perform to the terms of these contracts 
if this were to happen  the company s total accounting exposure would be limited to its historical amortized cost basis in these assets  although the true economic opportunity cost to the company could be higher 
each of the twelve counter parties to the company s interest rate agreements had a credit rating of at least a as of december  see note interest rate agreements in the notes to financial statements for additional information 
borrowings at the end of  the company s debt consisted of collateralized borrowing arrangements of various types reverse repurchase agreements  notes payable  revolving lines of credit 
all such borrowings were short term 
during  the company borrowed from fourteen different collateralized lenders 
the company s ability to roll over such borrowings when they mature depends on the market value  liquidity and credit quality of its assets  the soundness of the company s balance sheet as a whole  the state of the collateralized lending market  and other factors 
see note short term borrowings in the notes to financial statements for additional information 
the company has established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market in amounts in excess of its current requirements 
on average  the company believes that its average total borrowing capacity has been to of the market value of its mortgage assets 
the company  however  has limited its borrowings  and thus its potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of its balance sheet 
the term to maturity of the company s borrowings have ranged from one day to one year 
for some borrowings  the cost of funds adjusts to a market level on a monthly basis during the term of the borrowing  so the term to next rate adjustment may be shorter than the term to maturity 
at december   the weighted average term to maturity was days and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days  at december   the average term to maturity was days and the average term to next rate adjustment was days 
the company adjusts the maturities and other terms of its borrowings over time based on the interest rate characteristics of its balance sheet  the degree to which interest rate risk has been reduced through the use of interest rate agreements and other factors

liquidity allows the company to purchase additional mortgage assets and allows the company to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for the company include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity is defined as estimated borrowing capacity as shown above in table less total borrowings and is based on the market value of the company s assets and market conditions in the collateralized lending markets at period end 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of the company s mortgage assets and market conditions fluctuate and due to other factors 
potential immediate sources of liquidity totaled million at december  and million at december  the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of the company s risk adjusted capital policy  under this policy  asset growth is limited in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
the company s balance sheet generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
the company s operations through december  have been cash flow positive 
should the company s needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  management believes that the company s mortgage assets and interest rate agreements could be sold in most circumstances to raise cash although such sales could cause realized losses

the company has sought to maintain an equity to assets ratio of to for assets which have low credit risk  relatively low interest rate risk  good liquidity  and low lender over collateralization requirements 
for less liquid assets with credit risk  the company has sought to maintain an equity to assets ratio of to 
the company s per asset capital requirements have not changed significantly since the founding of the company  the decline in target equity to assets ratio during was a function of a change in asset mix 
these target levels of equity capitalization are higher than that of many banks  savings and loans  federal government mortgage agencies  insurance companies  and reits that act as mortgage portfolio lenders 
the target equity to assets ratio is determined through a board level process determined by the company s risk adjusted capital policy 
since these factors on which the guidelines are based do fluctuate  the company expects that at times its actual capital levels will fall below its capital guidelines from time to time 
when this occurs  management will cease the acquisition of new mortgage assets and will make plans to bring the company s capital levels back into compliance with its guidelines over time 
in certain limited circumstances and in limited amounts  the company may  prior to a planned equity offering  acquire or commit to acquire assets in excess of the levels proscribed by its risk adjusted capital levels 
for example  the company ended with assets of million in excess of what could have been supported by its capital base in the absence of this special provision 
the company s capital ratios were brought back within its standard risk adjusted capital guidelines through the company s january secondary common stock offering 
the company attempts to hold what it believes to be a reasonable amount of capital given the risks in its balance sheet  target capital levels could rise or fall over time 
if the company could continue to move towards a lower risk balance sheet through acquiring higher quality more liquid mortgage assets  acquiring mortgages with no periodic caps  replacing short term debt with long term debt  or other such means  the company would seek to lower its target equity to assets ratio in what it believes to be an appropriate manner 
in general  the company has been operating on average with significantly fewer assets than would have been allowed under its risk adjusted capital system 
the average equity to assets ratio has exceeded the target equity to assets ratio  the company s balance sheet capacity has been under utilized 
average balance sheet capacity utilization was in  with an average equity to assets ratio of as compared to an average target equity to assets ratio of 
average balance sheet capacity utilization was in  with an average balance sheet capacity utilization of as compared to an average target equity to assets ratio of 
the company s rate of asset growth makes it difficult for the company to achieve optimum capital efficiency 
the company generally raises equity capital before the acquisitions of related mortgage assets settle on its balance sheet 
the company hopes to increase its capital efficiency in the future through use of its equity shelf registration and through committing to acquire some assets in advance of planned equity offerings as described above

asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates management continually reviews the company s asset liability strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage principal repayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
the company seeks attractive risk adjusted shareholder returns while seeking to maintain a strong balance sheet and long term pattern of net income which grows over time relative to its competitors in the banking and savings and loan industries 
changes in interest rates  mortgage principal repayment rates  and other factors are likely  however  to cause short term volatility in the company s reported eps results  the company generally does not seek to hedge away or otherwise significantly reduce this potential short term earnings volatility 
the company has sought to manage the extent to which net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate liabilities and by hedging through the use of interest rate agreements to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime caps coupon adjustment restrictions in the assets 
should the company acquire other types of mortgages including fixed rate mortgages in the future  the company anticipates it will seek to reduce interest rate risks through funding with appropriately matched debt  through hedging  or other means 
in general  the company does not seek to anticipate future changes in interest rates 
the company seeks to prepare itself for a variety of possible future interest rate environments 
a primary goal of the company s asset liability strategy is to preserve liquidity by managing the net market value of the company s balance sheet as shown in the stockholders equity account 
through december   all of the company s borrowings were secured by the market value of its mortgage assets 
in seeking to preserve liquidity and the company s ability roll over short term borrowings  the company allocates what it believes to be a sufficient amount of capital to each mortgage asset and the company has undertaken a hedging program utilizing interest rate agreements 
in the event of an increase in short term and or long term interest rates  the market value of the company s mortgage assets would likely fall  particularly in the short term 
the company anticipates that  in such an event  the market value of its interest rate agreements would likely rise and partially offset decreases in mortgage values 
management believes that the combined effect of the company s equity allocations and its hedging program are likely to preserve liquidity for the company in most interest rate environments 
see asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates equity duration below 
the market value of the company s mortgage assets can also fluctuate as a function of changes in supply and demand  market volatility  and other factors which may be difficult or impossible to hedge 
changes in interest rates also may have an effect on the rate of mortgage principal repayment  the company has sought in the past to mitigate the economic effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets purchased at a premium with assets purchased at a discount 
such balancing was not possible in  however  as virtually all mortgage assets which were available for acquisition from the secondary mortgage market and which were otherwise attractive to the company were priced at a premium 
as a result  the company has significantly increased its net unamortized premium balance relative to the size of its balance sheet 
potential short term earnings volatility with respect to changes in mortgage principal repayment rates has increased as a result 
at december   the company estimates that its quarterly eps in the short term would be decreased by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the company s rate of mortgage principal repayment  all other factors being equal  eps would increase in a similar manner should principal repayment rates slow 
although the net effects on earnings of changes in interest rates  mortgage prepayment rates  and other factors cannot be determined in advance  management believes  given the balance sheet as of december   that some of the following effects may occur in an environment of rising short interest rates i earnings on that portion of the balance sheet funded with equity may rise over time as the coupons on adjustable rate mortgages adjust upwards  ii earnings on that portion of the balance sheet funded with borrowings spread lending may be initially reduced as borrowing costs rise more quickly than the coupons on adjustable rate mortgages  although most or all of the spread might be restored over time as the mortgage coupons fully adjust to the rate change  iii earnings may benefit from net hedge income or reduced net hedge expense from interest rate agreements  iv premium amortization expenses may be reduced if the rate of mortgage principal repayment diminishes 
all other factors being equal  the net effect of an increase in short term interest rates may be an initial drop in earnings followed by increased earnings after a lag period 
the length of any such lag period would likely be determined by the speed and extent of the change in interest rates 
management believes that most of these effects would likely be reversed in an environment of falling short term interest rates 
all other factors being equal  therefore  the net effect of falling short term interest rates  given the balance sheet as of december   could be an initial increase in earnings followed by decreased earnings after a lag period 
the company s change in its mix of assets throughout increased the company s basis risk between libor interest rates and us treasury bill interest rates 
the majority of the company s assets at year end had coupons which changed as a function of us treasury bill rates while all the company s borrowings had a cost of funds which tends to change in conjunction with changes in libor rates 
the company believes its interest rate agreements mitigate to some degree the extent to which a reduced spread for the company would result from libor rates rising relative to us treasury interest rates 
see note interest rate agreements in the notes to financial statements for additional information 
should the company continue its funding strategy in effect at december   the company s short term earnings will also fluctuate to some extent with changes in the relationship between six and twelve month interest rates off of which the coupons on company s mortgage assets adjust and one to six month interest rates on which the company s cost of funds is based 
all other factors being equal  a flatter yield curve in the short end of the yield curve when six and twelve month rates are low relative to one to six month rates may have a negative effect on the company s spread earnings 
in general  the company s goal is to stabilize spread lending income over longer periods of time and allow income from equity funded lending to rise as short term interest rates rise and fall as short term interest rates fall 
if the company were to achieve this goal  the company s return on average equity  earnings and dividends would  over longer periods of time  rise as short term interest rates rise  fall as short term interest rates fall  and thus maintain a constant or widening spread to the level of short term interest rates over time 
should long term interest rates rise while short term interest rates remain stable  management expects  based on the company s balance sheet as of december   that mortgage principal repayment rates may slow thus benefiting earnings but the market value of the company s assets  net of hedges  would likely fall thus potentially reducing the amount of assets the company could carry on its balance sheet 
other effects may occur in such a circumstance as well 
interest rate sensitivity gap before hedging the table below shows the company s cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  or maturity gap  for periods of one month to five years as a percentage of total assets 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is a tool used by financial institutions such as banks and savings and loans to analyze the possible effects of interest rate changes on net income over time 
the gap measures the amount of assets that mature or have a coupon adjustment in a particular period as compared to the amount of liabilities similarly adjusting during that time 
a negative gap implies that rising interest rates will lead to lower earnings  while a positive gap implies that rising interest rates will lead to higher earnings 
lower interest rates would have the opposite effect 
in each case  these effects are limited to the particular time period for which the gap is calculated 
as applied to the company  this gap analysis ignores the effect of the company s hedging activities interest rate agreements  the effect of the periodic and lifetime caps in the company s assets  the effects of lookbacks whereby coupons on company assets are set based on interest rates one to three months prior  the effect of changes in mortgage principal repayment rates and other factors 
nevertheless  the gap analysis can provide some useful information on the company s interest rate risk profile 
the company s three month cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets was negative at december  this suggests that the initial impact on the company s earnings of rising interest rates would be negative 
falling interest rates would have the opposite effect 
the company had a cumulative twelve month gap of positive at december  this implies that the impact on net interest income of increasing interest rates may be positive after several quarters even though the initial impact could have been negative 
falling interest rates would likely have the opposite effect 
although the company s balance sheet does have these characteristics  since a variety of factors such as interest rate agreements have not been taken into account in the gap analysis  it is not possible to assess  solely on this basis  what the actual impact of such interest rate changes on the company s net income would be  especially over shorter time periods 
the company has a positive interest rate sensitivity gap for periods of one year or longer even though virtually all assets and liabilities adjust within one year because the company has more earning assets than interest bearing liabilities a portion of the company s earning assets are funded with equity

see results of operations cost of borrowed funds and hedging and the interest rate spread above and note interest rate agreements of the notes to financial statements for further detail and information 
the interest rate agreements are designed to produce income for the company as short term interest rates rise to partially or fully offset possible losses of net interest income from the spread lending portion of the company s balance sheet 
these agreements can be thought of as serving to limit potential increases in the costs of the company s borrowings or  alternatively  as serving to remove some of the periodic and lifetime caps imbedded in the company s assets 
these agreements also serve to remove some of the short term risk arising from funding assets that have fixed coupon adjustments for six to twelve months with liabilities that are fixed  on average as of december   for a three month shorter period of time 
in addition  the interest rate agreements are designed to appreciate in market value in most circumstances in which short term and or long term interest rates rise sharply  thereby partially offsetting likely concurrent declines in the market value of the company s mortgage assets 
interest rate futures and options the company has used interest rate futures and may use listed options on interest rate futures as part of its on going interest rate risk management process 
these instruments are in some ways similar to the interest rate agreements  the company uses them in a similar manner and for hedging purposes only 
the company currently limits the aggregate amount of funds that the company will deposit as original margin on futures plus premiums on listed options to less than of the company s total assets  after taking into account unrealized gains and unrealized losses on any such contracts 
the company currently limits its use of futures and listed options so that its profits from such instruments will be limited to or less of the company s gross taxable income on an annual basis 
the company had no positions in futures or options on futures at december  or december  equity duration the company uses equity duration to measure the stability of the market value of its assets with respect to the size of its equity base as interest rates fluctuate 
equity duration is a theoretical calculation of the projected percentage change in the reported equity base of the company that would occur if short term and long term interest rates moved up or down by overnight 
the company s goal is to maintain an equity duration of less than 
in practice  the company believes it has maintained an equity duration of less than 
should interest rates increase by more than  the company believes its equity duration would increase 
inflation virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive the company s performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals and the company s dividends are determined by the company s net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  the company s activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
seasonal effects there are three factors that management has identified which may have seasonal effects on the company s earnings 
first  management believes that in many years there may be more mortgage assets for sale by motivated sellers in the fourth quarter of the year than at any other time 
if this is true  in many years the company could grow at a faster rate in the fourth quarter than at other times of the year 
secondly  mortgage principal repayment rates have a seasonal pattern of slowing in the winter and accelerating in the summer 
since the company s premium amortization expenses are based on the company s actual monthly principal repayment experience  overall earnings may be higher  all other things being equal  in the winter months 
finally  there is a mismatch in the day count method that is used each month to determine the company s interest income from mortgages and its interest expense from collateralized borrowings 
as a result  given the characteristics of the company s balance sheet as of december  and assuming all other factors are equal  net interest income should tend to be higher in quarters  such as the first and second quarters of the year  that have fewer days
