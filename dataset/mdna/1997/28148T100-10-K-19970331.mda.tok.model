quarterly information and seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal 
typically  sales and operating income are highest during the third and fourth quarters and are lowest during the first and second quarters 
this seasonal pattern is primarily due to the increased demand for the company s products during the back to school and year end holiday selling season 
the company has typically experienced losses during the first quarter in the past and may experience such seasonal losses in the future  including the first quarter of the following table sets forth unaudited statement of operations data for each of the company s last eight quarters

the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
net income per share computations for each quarter are independent of the year end computations

quarterly sales and operating results are also affected by the timing of new product introductions  the product mix  the timing of orders placed by the company s distributors and dealers  and the timing of marketing expenditures 
the company s quarterly gross profit margins have fluctuated as a result of such factors as customer and product mix and changes in the purchased cost of products 
products are generally shipped as orders are received and accordingly the company has historically operated with little backlog 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed and are budgeted based primarily on the company s annual sales forecast 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company s working capital needs have been met through funds generated from operations and from the company s revolving line of credit 
the company s principal need for working capital has been to meet peak inventory and accounts receivable requirements associated with its seasonal sales pattern 
the company increases inventory levels during the spring and summer months in anticipation of increasing shipments in the late summer and fall 
accounts receivable typically increase during the summer and fall because of the company s use of dating programs  wherein sales are made to the company s customers for which payment is deferred for one to three months based on the size of the sales orders 
due to said sales patterns  the largest customer orders are shipped during the summer and fall  hence increasing accounts receivable balances during the third and fourth quarters

the company currently has a revolving line of credit with a bank which is collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
under the revolving line of credit agreement  which expires june   the company may borrow up to million 
the agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  minimum annual net income amounts and tangible net worth amounts  and provides for various restrictions including limitations on advances to the company s subsidiary  capital expenditures and additional indebtedness
