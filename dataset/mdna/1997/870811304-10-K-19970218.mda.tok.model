the company operates in four principal business segments hygiene  maids and surface doctor services conducted through franchise operations which generate franchise sales and annuity revenues ie  services fees  product sales  royalties and marketing fees  and each of the company s wholly owned hygiene  swisher maids and surface doctor operations 
the company acquired surface doctor effective july   and the company s financial statements reflect the surface doctor franchise operations and certain company owned surface doctor operations for the four month period ended october  company owned surface doctor operations were sold to a franchisee in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
in february  the company s wholly owned swisher maids subsidiary began operating in charlotte  north carolina in preparation for initiating the maid service franchise marketing program 
in october  the company sold its first swisher maids franchises 
prior to and during a majority of the year ended october   the company derived its revenues exclusively from company owned hygiene operations 
during the fiscal year  the company commenced selling its existing majority owned hygiene subsidiaries as franchises in their existing markets and began selling other franchises in new markets 
this repositioning of the company was a direct result of management s determination in late that an opportunity existed to accelerate the company s penetration of the national hygiene market and increase its profitability through a program of selling franchises 
as the company implemented its plan to operate as a franchise business  including the sale of majority owned subsidiaries as franchises  revenues from company owned hygiene operations declined  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
at october   the company had substantially completed its repositioning to a franchise business as a result of the sale as franchises of all of its majority owned subsidiaries and had commenced an international franchise sales program 
the company nevertheless continues to maintain company owned hygiene operations servicing portions of north and south carolina  florida and oklahoma 
in addition  the company repurchased and currently owns and operates hygiene franchises located in jacksonville and space coast  florida and tulsa  oklahoma 
the company also continues to operate a swisher maids business in portions of charlotte  north carolina 
management s decision to reposition the company has resulted in substantial increases in revenues from franchise operations since the fiscal year ended october  revenues from franchise operations  including franchise sales  product sales  royalties  service fees  marketing fees and interest income  have increased consistently from  in the fiscal year to  in the fiscal year 
the company experienced a decrease in net income during fiscal  due to the cost of expanding the company s infrastructure to support its present and future growth in hygiene services and products 
net income increased during fiscal due largely to the increase in hygiene franchise revenues  particularly revenues attributable to product sales and royalties 
from april to october  the total number of swisher hygiene and maid franchises had grown from to  also at october   the company had surface doctor franchises 
assets held for sale consist of assets purchased by the company from certain franchisees who failed to comply with the terms of their franchise agreements 
the company intends to sell such assets as soon as possible 
notes receivable consist of all or a portion of the initial franchise fees financed by the company 
the notes are collateralized by the franchisees assets and  in some cases  are personally guaranteed by the franchisees
