item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company maintains its records on a fiscal year ending on september of each year and all references to a year refer to the fiscal year ending on that date 
overview the company was incorporated in january to design  develop  manufacture and market a broad range of electronic components based on saw technology and used in telecommunications  data communications  video transmission  military and space systems and other applications 
the company s focus has been on the high end performance spectrum of the market  and its primary products are saw bandpass filters  resonators  delay lines  oscillators and saw based subsystems 
the company s products were initially concentrated in the military and space systems market  with over half of net sales in attributable to this market segment 
since then  the company made a strategic decision to target commercial markets  which accounted for approximately of its net sales in the company has also witnessed significant growth in its international markets over the last five years 
international sales represented less than of net sales in  of net sales in and approximately of net sales in the company derives revenue from high volume commercial production components  military industrial production components and engineering services and products 
non recurring engineering revenue is included in engineering services and products and relates to the design and development of custom devices and delivery of one or more prototype parts 
in all cases  revenue is recognized when the parts or services have been completed and units  including prototypes  have been shipped 
net sales increased from to  and from to the growth in net sales is attributable to growth in the wireless communications market to which the company supplies saw bandpass filters for cellular telephone base stations and handheld subscriber telephones

the company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of its net sales in the foreseeable future 
there is a trend toward lower average selling prices for base station filters due to competitive pricing pressures and to the installation of more micro base stations which use less expensive  lower performance saw filters 
the company is uncertain whether an increase in the number of base station filters sold in the future will offset the decrease in the average selling price for these filters so as to maintain or increase revenues from the sale of base station filters 
the company believes that its sales of saw filters for subscriber handsets in the cdma market will increase significantly in fiscal year handset filters typically produce lower gross margins than the gross margins produced by base station filters

these esop shares are accounted for in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  which uses cost as the basis for valuing shares as they are released and allocated to participants accounts 
in  the company borrowed an additional million and loaned it to the esop to enable it to purchase  shares of common stock 
in  the loan was repaid resulting in the allocation of the related shares to participants accounts 
these shares are accounted for in accordance with the aicpa s sop  which uses market value as the basis of valuing shares 
the impact of this was a charge to esop compensation expense of million reflected in the financial results for of the million  million was a one time  non cash charge amounting to per share 
the company does not anticipate contributing additional shares of common stock beyond those that already have been placed in trust for the esop
