friedson  the president and chief executive officer of the company  us philips corporation  north american philips corporation and nv philips gloellampenfabrieken together  philips 
this action concerns the settlement the philips settlement of certain claims  primarily a federal antitrust claim  made by the company against philips  which resulted in an  judgment in favor of the company 
pursuant to the philips settlement  philips paid the company  in may as part of the philips settlement  the company and philips agreed that the company s money judgment against philips in connection with such antitrust litigation would be vacated 
izumi is claiming  among other things  that the philips settlement  including the agreement with philips to cooperate to vacate the related judgment in favor of the company  constitutes a breach by the company of a customary indemnification agreement between izumi as seller of goods and the company as buyer of goods dated february  this indemnification agreement covered certain claims against the company and was entered into more than eight months prior to the commencement of the philips litigation in connection with the routine purchase by the company of goods from izumi 
izumi advanced certain legal fees and costs to the company in connection with the philips litigation 
izumi is further claiming that it is entitled to recover from the company an unspecified portion of the philips settlement  punitive damages and reimbursement of litigation and other related costs and expenses 
a pre answer motion by the company resulted in the dismissal of some of izumi s claims  and the company answered the remaining claims 
a mediation was held on february  to consider settlement of the case

prior to the filing of westinghouse s complaint against the company  white consolidated  on november   filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio against westinghouse and another corporation for trademark infringement  dilution  false designation or origin and false advertisement  seeking both injunctive relief and damages 
procedural motions concerning the jurisdiction in which the dispute should be heard have been filed by the parties 
the action by westinghouse seeks  among other things  a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from using the trademark  un specified damages and attorneys fees 
pursuant to the indemnification agreement dated january  by and among white consolidated  kmart corporation  and the company  white consolidated is defending and indemnifying the company for all costs and expenses for claims  damages  and losses  including the costs of litigation 
pursuant to the license agreements with white consolidated  white consolidated is defending and indemnifying salton maxim and new m tech for all costs and expenses for claims  damages  and losses  including the costs of litigation 
on january   on joint motion of the parties  the court issued an order staying future proceedings for sixty days in order to give the parties an opportunity to pursue settlement discussions 
the company is also subject to other legal proceedings  product liability and other claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  in excess of applicable insurance coverage  is not likely to have a material effect on the financial position of the company 
however  as the outcome of litigation or other legal claims is difficult to predict  significant changes in the estimated exposures could occur 
manufacturing operations the company s products are primarily manufactured by durable  its wholly owned hong kong subsidiary  in bao an county  guandong province of the people s republic of china  which is approximately miles northwest of central hong kong 
the company has a significant amount of its assets in the people s republic  primarily consisting of inventory  equipment and molds 
substantially all of the company s products are manufactured by durable and unrelated factories in the people s republic 
approximately percent to percent of the company s revenues are currently derived from products manufactured by durable 
the supply and cost of these products  as well as finished products  can be adversely affected  among other reasons  by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  increased import duties  imposition of tariffs  imposition of import quotas  interruptions in sea or air transportation and political or economic changes 
from time to time  the company explores opportunities to diversify its sourcing and or production of certain products to other low cost locations or with other third parties or joint venture partners in order to reduce its dependence on production in the people s republic and or reduce durable s dependence on the company s existing distribution base 
however  at the present time  the company intends to continue its production in the people s republic 
in june  the people s republic experienced civil disturbances 
although such disturbances have dissipated since that time  there continues to be pressure for political reform 
no assurance can be given  however  that civil disturbances will not recur 
if it becomes necessary to relocate the company s manufacturing facilities from the people s republic as a result of civil disturbances in that country or otherwise  the company believes the production currently conducted in the people s republic could be relocated to other far east locations  including hong kong  or other low cost manufacturing locations  with only temporary disruption and delay in such production and possible short term operating and capital losses  provided that the company is able to move substantially all of its manufacturing equipment and other assets currently in the people s republic to another location 
if the company is unable to remove such assets  due to confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  embargoes or governmental restrictions  it would incur substantial operating and capital losses  including losses resulting from business disruption and delays in production 
in addition  as a result of a relocation of its manufacturing equipment and certain other assets  the company would likely incur relatively higher manufacturing costs 
a relocation could also adversely affect the company s revenues if the demand for the company s products currently manufactured in the people s republic decreases due to a dis ruption in the production and delivery of such products or due to higher prices which might result from increased manufacturing costs 
furthermore  earnings could be adversely affected due to reduced sales and or the company s inability to maintain its current margins on the products currently manufactured in the people s republic
