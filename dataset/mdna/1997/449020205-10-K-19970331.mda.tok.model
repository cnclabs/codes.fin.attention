item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hytech sells specialty personal care cosmetic products  primarily for skin care  and to a lesser extent oral health care products  most of which are covered by patent  license and royalty agreements 
the amended qvc license agreement provides that qvc will purchase licensed products solely from hytech  and the license agreement with national patent provides that hytech will generally pay royalties on its sales to national patent and receive royalties from national patent from sales of certain of that company s products 
hytech is developing other personal care cosmetics for consumers and health care products for professionals using hydron polymers  and anticipates using its patented technology as a drug delivery system in proprietary products  in which hydron polymers act as a drug release mechanism 
hytech intends to either seek licensing arrangements for its drug delivery technology with third parties  or develop and market proprietary products through its own efforts 
hytech commenced marketing its products on qvc in april results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal year ended december  fiscal of  reflect a increase of  or from the  of net sales for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal 
this increase is primarily the result of qvc s purchasing patterns  along with increased sales to the infomercial joint venture and qvc europe 
qvc s purchasing patterns are primarily affected by the timing of the hydron care programming 
approximately and of hytech s sales during fiscal and fiscal  respectively were to qvc and its related entities  including the infomercial joint venture and qvc europe 
management anticipates that sales to qvc will continue to grow as hytech further extends its skin care line  adds other product lines  and broadens its marketing efforts to include other forms of electronic and conventional retailing 
absent the consummation of marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties other than qvc  the percentage of sales to qvc and hytech s dependence upon qvc as a substantial customer will remain significant 
hytech s gross profit margin decreased percentage points to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to fluctuations in the mix of products sold to qvc in those periods  increased to the infomercial partnership at lower gross margins  and reduced pricing on products sold to qvc as a result of the amended license agreement 
management anticipates gross profit margins  relating to sales to qvc  to remain at approximately 
research and development r d expenses reflect hytech s efforts to identify new product opportunities  develop and package the products for commercial sale  perform appropriate efficacy and safety tests  and conduct consumer panel studies and focus groups 
r d expenses increased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the amount of r d expenses per year varies  depending on the steps taken towards development during such year  as well as the number and type of products under development at such time 
included in r d expense in fiscal is approximately  of royalty fees paid to a consultant relating to product development under a contract expiring on december  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase is attributable to an overall increase in salary requirements  expansion of full time staff  including customer service personnel  additional office and warehouse rent and increased advertising expense  primarily relating to the production  distribution and advertising for hytech s new magalog  a direct mail catalog launched in november distribution agreement expense of  pertains to costs incurred in connection with the execution of the amended license agreement 
in connection with the execution and delivery of the amended license agreement  hytech granted dtr an option to purchase million shares of the company s common stock at 
per share  resulting in a one time non cash charge against earnings of approximately million 
this non cash charge has no effect on the company s shareholders equity 
interest and investment income in fiscal decreased percent  to  from  in fiscal  primarily as a result of lower interest rates 
hytech maintains a conservative investment strategy  deriving investment income primarily from us treasury securities 
net income for fiscal decreased to a net loss of  from net income of  for fiscal  primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 
discounting the effect of the expenses associated with the amended license agreement  hytech would have reported net income of  or 
per share for fiscal forward looking statement in its quarterly report on form q for the period ended september   hytech made the forward looking statement to the effect that  based upon proposed increases in air time that qvc would be required to make if it is to meet the minimum purchase levels necessary to maintain its exclusive rights  then management believed that hytech would have record sales and earnings for fiscal such statement was qualified by the following this assumes  however  that qvc makes its purchases on a pro rata basis over the annual term of the amended license agreement 
further  no obligation exists for qvc to promote or purchase product  and no assurances can be given that qvc will meet escalating minimum purchase levels for subsequent years in order to maintain exclusive rights 
as of march   qvc has made purchases of approximately million during the first term of the amended license agreement  and based upon present purchasing patterns  it appears that qvc will be approximately million short of making the minimum purchase level necessary to maintain its exclusive license 
management of qvc has requested that hytech waive the minimum purchase requirement of the first year of the amended license agreement  which expires on may  if an agreement is reached on waiving the minimum purchase levels for the first term of the amended license agreement  then no assurance can be given that hytech will have record sales and earnings for fiscal if no agreement is reached with regard to waiving the minimum purchase requirement for the first term  then either  qvc will not make the minimum purchases and hytech will be able to terminate such relationship  or qvc will make an usually large purchase in order to maintain its exclusive rights prior to the end of the term or the following thirty day cure period 
if qvc does not meet such minimum purchase levels  then hytech has the right to terminate the agreement and seek other marketing and distribution arrangements for its products 
the loss of qvc as a customer would have a material  adverse impact upon the financial condition of hytech 
if qvc were to cease acting as hytech s exclusive marketing agent in the western hemisphere  then hytech would attempt to reach the existing base of hydron customers utilizing various alternative methods of marketing  as well as other access to direct response television 
no assurance can be given that hytech could reach any substantial portion of such existing customer base in the foreseeable future utilizing any such alternative methods 
if qvc makes an unusually large purchase of hydron products in order to maintain its exclusive rights for the next twelve month term of the amended license agreement  then hytech may experience unusually disparate quarters  as it may take a substantial time for qvc to sell the products purchased in the unusually large purchase order 
further  it will be highly unlikely that qvc would make the minimum purchase levels for the following term 
therefore  qvc may not provide hytech with any substantial quantity or quality of on air hours in view of the impending termination of the relationship 
end of forward looking statement results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal of  reflect a decrease of  or from  in net sales for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal 
this decrease is primarily the result of qvc s purchasing patterns  partially offset by increased sales to the infomercial joint venture and qvc s european affiliate qvc europe 
qvc s purchasing patterns  which are primarily affected by the timing of hydron care programming  resulted in qvc holding approximately million more of hytech s inventory  at qvc s cost  at december  than it held in inventory at december  retail sales of hytech s products by qvc to consumers increased thirty percent in fiscal over retail sales in fiscal no obligation exists for qvc to purchase product under the terms of the qvc license agreement  except to maintain such exclusive rights  and no assurances can be given that qvc will meet the escalating minimum purchase levels for subsequent years in order to maintain such exclusive rights 
management is actively pursuing opportunities to increase on air programming on qvc in fiscal  focusing primarily on new program formats  line extensions and special promotions 
in fiscal  special one day promotions of hydron products conducted by qvc in february and july generated million and million in retail sales to consumers during two hour periods  respectively 
however  no assurances can be given that qvc will grant hytech additional on air selling time  and the failure to receive such additional on air selling time could negatively impact sales 
management anticipates that increased sales to the infomerical joint venture  albeit at lower gross margins  together with an increase in back end sales  may offset any such decrease in sales  if any 
approximately of hytech s sales during fiscal and fiscal were to qvc and its related entities  including the infomercial joint venture and qvc europe 
management anticipates that sales to qvc will continue to grow as hytech further extends its skin care line  adds other product lines  and broadens its marketing efforts to include other forms of electronic and conventional retailing 
absent the consummation of marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties other than qvc  the percentage of sales to qvc and hytech s dependence upon qvc as a substantial customer will remain significant 
hytech s gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to fluctuations in the mix of products sold to qvc in those periods 
during fiscal  hytech introduced five new products  three of which were hair care or bath and body products which provide a lower profit margin than hytech s skin care products 
further  management  in conjunction with qvc  made the decision to package several of hytech s individual skin care products in a collection and agreed to price such collection at a substantial discount from the aggregate costs of all of the individual items 
this marketing strategy is a concerted effort by management to further broaden the number of consumers using hytech s products  as well as to increase the distribution of the complete hydron product line 
management believes that once consumers sample a wider variety of hytech s products  they are more likely to reorder more of such products  either the entire collection  or individual products at higher prices 
research and development r d expenses reflect hytech s efforts to identify new product opportunities  develop and package the products for commercial sale  perform appropriate efficacy and safety tests  and conduct consumer panel studies and focus groups 
r d expenses decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the amount of r d expenses per year varies  depending on the steps taken toward development during such year  as well as the number and type of products under development at such time 
substantially all of the r d activities have been performed for hytech by charles fox associates inc the consultant pursuant to a series of one year agreements 
hytech has entered into an agreement with the consultant providing for research and development services for a one year period commencing march in return for a monthly fee of  plus reimbursement of expenses 
in addition  such agreement provides that the principal of the consultant  charles fox  will make live appearances on qvc  and will appear for taping of one or more infomercials for hytech products 
in return for such personal appearances  during calendar year hytech will pay a royalty to the consultant equal to two and one half percent of the net sales of hydron polymer based products  with a maximum royalty of  such royalty will be paid quarterly  with a minimum quarterly sales royalty to the consultant equal to 
finally  the consultant has agreed that such royalty payments will be used solely to exercise three outstanding stock options held by charles fox to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock of hytech 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase is attributable to an overall increase in salary requirements  expansion of full time staff  including customer service personnel  and increased advertising expenses  primarily relating to the production and mailing of hytech s quarterly newsletter 
this increase in overall selling  general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a non recurring  predominantly non cash charge in fiscal of approximately  in legal and miscellaneous costs related to the settlement of a lawsuit 
interest and investment income in fiscal increased percent  to  from  in fiscal  resulting from the investment of additional cash from operations 
hytech maintains a conservative investment strategy  deriving investment income primarily from us treasury securities 
net income for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal  primarily a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and financial resources hytech s overall financial condition remains strong as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december  compared to december  working capital at december  was approximately million and cash flow from operations in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal hytech s cash flow from operations is a direct result of its marketing efforts with qvc 
the qvc license agreement provides that qvc purchase products directly from hytech for resale to consumers  and that hytech receive payment from qvc thirty days after qvc s receipt of such goods 
investing activities used  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the fiscal investing activities consisted primarily of leasehold improvements for hytech s new administrative office and hytech s investment in the infomercial joint venture 
financing activities in fiscal and fiscal related primarily to the payment of cash dividends totaling  and  respectively 
financing activities in fiscal also generated  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
based on hytech s absence of any short or long term debt  present cash position  relatively small accounts payable  third party contractual approach to manufacturing and r d  and present business strategy  management believes that hytech has adequate resources to meet normal  recurring obligations as they become due 
further  in view of the thirty day payment terms in connection with sales to qvc  management does not anticipate any difficulty in financing foreseeable inventory requirements 
in november management commenced marketing of its products through its catalog and has supported such marketing efforts with print advertisements in national women s magazines  as well as athletic sponsorships and community events 
however  management recognizes that hytech may not have the financial resources to sustain a major  national advertising campaign to successfully market its products 
in view of the foregoing  management has obtained with qvc  and continues to seek internationally  marketing  licensing and distribution agreements with third parties which have greater financial resources and that can enhance hytech s product introductions with appropriate national marketing support programs 
in the event of the termination of the qvc license agreement  hytech may seek other access to direct response television to market its products 
the effect of inflation has not been significant upon either the operations or financial condition of hytech
