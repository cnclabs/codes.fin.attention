net sales and shipments the company generated record sales of  on record aluminum shipments of approximately million tonnes in sales of  in and  in were generated on aluminum shipments of approximately and million tonnes  respectively 
the company s net sales are sensitive to changes in the world pricing of primary aluminum 
the price sensitivity impacts substantially all of the company s products to varying degrees  with less impact on the more specialized and value added products 
the lme cash price averaged  per tonne in compared with  and  per tonne in and  respectively 
the lme price declined during from a january average of  per tonne to a december average of  per tonne 
net sales for reflect the impact of the annual average price decline 
sales growth of percent in is attributable to improved pricing offset somewhat by a decline in shipments 
primary products external net sales in decreased nine percent on shipment declines of ten percent directly resulting from higher internal consumption from downstream operations

primary products external net sales in increased percent on shipment declines of two percent  having benefited from overall higher realized selling prices in as compared to primary production declined four percent in  reflecting the sale of a percent undivided interest in the intalco and eastalco aluminum reduction facilities on march  semi fabricated products net sales in increased percent over  principally due to shipment increases of percent 
substantially all of the increase in shipments was generated through the acquisition of cressona  which more than doubled the capacity of the company s extrusion business  creating an organization regarded as having the world s largest soft alloy extrusion manufacturing capacity 
slightly offsetting the impact of higher shipments were lower prices in the company s sheet mill operations 
the sheet industry continues to experience low pricing due to overcapacity which has resulted primarily from displaced can sheet capacity 
to address the issue of low prices  the company is upgrading its sheet facilities and is focusing its manufacturing and marketing efforts on higher margin niche products while transitioning away from commodity sheet products 
semi fabricated products net sales in declined two percent from on shipment declines of percent 
the decline in shipments principally reflects the closure of two sheet mill operations at joliet  illinois  and riverside  california  along with the impact of the august disposition of an aluminum distribution business 
the decline in shipments was offset by higher realized prices in all businesses  particularly from strong demand of extruded products in the transportation industry 
fabricated products net sales in declined percent on a seven percent decline in shipments 
the company sold fab products  which had sales of in and in through the date of disposition  on september  this decline in sales was partially offset by an increase in sales to the domestic building and construction market 
general economic conditions in the united states have had a positive impact on the domestic building and construction markets  while european architectural sales declined because of sluggish economic conditions in major european markets 
fabricated products net sales increased eight percent on a decline in shipments of percent 
higher realized pricing at all the fabricated products businesses more than offset lower volumes 
approximately percent of the volume decline in resulted from lower external billet sales in a secondary aluminum operation in europe 
cost and expenses the company s cost and expenses were  for compared to  for and  for the increase in total cost and expense levels in reflects the expanded volume from the company s extrusion operations combined with increases in raw material  research  business and product development costs  partially offset by a volume reduction associated with the fab products disposition 
in  the company incurred certain costs associated with the effects of production curtailments  higher raw material and power costs  and external aluminum purchases 
however  total cost of goods sold remained flat in in comparison to due to lower shipments 
primary production during and was below total nameplate capacity due to curtailments at the company s intalco and mt 
holly primary aluminum reduction facilities 
these curtailments were made in response to certain power curtailments initiated by the bonneville power administration  a supplier of power to the intalco facility  and the then prevailing low world pricing of aluminum 
during the fourth quarter of  in response to the anticipated increase in demand for primary aluminum from the company s downstream businesses and the availability of favorably priced power  the company announced the restart of its curtailed capacity 
the restarts were completed by january and the facilities are currently operating at capacity

interest on outstanding balances will be based on either a base rate or libor option 
at december   the entire amount of the facility was available to the company 
the credit agreement contains provisions for restricting the incurrence of indebtedness by subsidiaries  as well as financial and other covenants 
under the credit agreement  the company and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively are required to maintain tangible net worth of at least at any time  and the company and certain of its subsidiaries  excluding the lauralco project group see note to the financial statements included elsewhere herein  are collectively required to maintain a ratio of tangible net assets to funded debt of at least to at any time

under this restriction  at december   of retained earnings were available for the payment of dividends on common stock 
management believes current cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and available funds from the revolving credit facility described above are sufficient to meet the company s planned level of capital spending and to service its debt 
as a result  in april  the company withdrew its shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission covering the issuance of up to million shares of common stock 
on november   the company announced that it was redeeming all of the outstanding shares of its series a convertible preferred stock preferred stock  par value per share  on december  each share of the preferred stock was redeemable at a price of per share  plus an amount equal to the quarterly dividend accrued on each share through the redemption date for a total cash redemption price of per share 
as an alternative to redemption  each share of the preferred stock was convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the company s common stock until the close of business on december  in december  the outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into approximately million shares of alumax common stock 
income taxes the internal revenue service the irs has asserted that alumax and certain of its subsidiaries were improperly included in the  and consolidated income tax returns of amax inc  the company s former parent company  and on that basis has asserted a federal income tax deficiency against alumax of approximately interest on the deficiency through december   would be approximately in response to the irs notice of deficiency  the company filed a petition in the united states tax court the court  seeking a redetermination in respect of the purported deficiency 
the parties have waived their rights to a trial and the matter has been submitted to the court for decision based upon the pleadings  stipulations  memoranda and other documents submitted  or to be submitted  to the court by the parties 
a decision by the court is expected in late payment of the deficiency with interest thereon would provide certain tax benefits to the company that would offset in part  in the year of payment and within the carryforward period  the cost of paying the deficiency and interest 
the company believes that it has adequate reserves so that any unprovided for net deficiency would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
risk management the company utilizes certain financial instruments in connection with its risk management 
the risk of loss related to counterparty nonperformance under financial instrument agreements at december  is not significant 
the company enters into forward fixed price arrangements that are required by certain customers and suppliers 
the company may utilize futures contracts which effectively convert forward fixed price arrangements to market prices in order to meet overall strategic objectives 
such contracts covered approximately  tonnes of aluminum at december  and mature at various dates through gains or losses with respect to these positions are reflected in earnings concurrent with consummation of the underlying fixed price transaction 
periodic value fluctuations of the futures contracts approximately offset the value fluctuations of the underlying fixed price transactions 
the company also may  from time to time  establish a floor selling price for varying quantities of future production  while preserving the opportunity to participate in upward price movements 
this may be accomplished by entering into forward sales of primary aluminum and purchases of call options  which together provide the same price protection as purchasing put options  or by purchasing put options alone  in a manner which correlates with the company s production and sales of primary aluminum 
the strategy may be modified from time to time 
at december   the company s commitments with respect to these financial instruments covered approximately  tonnes of future production 
the book value and market value of these financial instruments were and  respectively  at december  certain of the company s foreign operating expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the operations functional currencies  which expose the company to exchange rate risks 
in order to mitigate its exposure to exchange rate risk where these conditions exist  the company may utilize forward foreign currency contracts 
at december   the company had outstanding in forward foreign currency contracts which principally mature during the gains or losses related to these contracts are deferred and included in the measurement of the related foreign denominated transactions 
if these contracts had been terminated at december   the company would have received approximately the company s debt instruments and related interest rate hedges are susceptible to market fluctuations based on changes in the cost of borrowing 
at december   the fair value of total debt approximated book value 
the lauralco credit facility  which has a variable interest rate  required the company to establish facilities to effectively limit the interest rate exposure of the commitment 
to meet this requirement  the company has obtained interest rate swaps with notional amounts totalling through october  and an interest rate cap with a notional amount of expiring october  this program is designed to effectively cap interest rate exposure at a maximum of approximately nine percent through october  the effective rate on this debt amounted to percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company would have paid approximately to terminate these interest rate agreements at december  the company also purchases natural gas for its operations and enters into forward contracts to eliminate the volatility in prices 
at december   none of these contracts is material 
environmental matters the company has been named as a defendant or identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and similar state laws by governmental agencies and private parties at pending waste disposal sites which  in most instances  were owned and operated by third parties 
management periodically evaluates such matters and records or adjusts liabilities for remediation and other costs and potential damages when expenditures for such costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company s ultimate liability in connection with present and future environmental claims will depend on many factors  including its volumetric share of the waste at a given site  the remedial action required  the total cost of remediation and the financial viability and participation of the other entities which also sent waste to the site 
based upon current law and information known to the company concerning the size of the sites known to it  their years of operation  and the number of other past users  management believes that it has adequate reserves for the company s probable share of the estimated aggregate liability for the costs of remedial actions and related costs and expenses and that such liability and related costs and expenses should not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or ongoing results of operations of the company 
in addition  the company establishes reserves for remedial measures required from time to time at its own facilities 
any expenditures for remediation programs it may be required to undertake  either individually or in the aggregate  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or ongoing results of operations of the company 
the company s environmental reserves totalled and at december  and  respectively at december  with the inclusion of cressona 
management believes that the reasonably probable outcomes of these matters will not materially exceed established reserves 
although the company believes it has coverage for some environmental claims under certain insurance policies  insurance recoveries are not considered in estimating the company s share of remediation costs at a site unless an insurance carrier has agreed to pay a portion of such costs 
insurance recoveries were not considered in establishing reserves for any of these sites absent an agreement between the carriers and the company 
management does not anticipate that commitments  operating expenses or capital expenditures for environmental compliance through and including the next fiscal year will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or ongoing results of operations 
based on historical trends toward tighter environmental standards  however  it appears likely that the company will incur additional expenditures to remain in compliance with federal and state environmental laws
