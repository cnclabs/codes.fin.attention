item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein  under general and potential factors affecting future operating results 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the statement under general regarding the company s expectation of continuing to incur operating losses as well as negative cash flows  the statement under sales and marketing regarding the company s anticipation that sales and marketing expenses will increase  the statement under research and development regarding the company s anticipation that research and development expenditures will increase and the statement in the third paragraph under liquidity and capital resources regarding the length of time that the company s resources will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements 
general the company develops  manufactures and markets a proprietary platform technology the cholestech ldx r system which in the preventive care market measures specific analytes to detect various diseases and disorders within five minutes using a single drop of whole blood 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of march   had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company is developing certain additional tests designed to extend the cholestech ldx system s capabilities 
the company believes that its future growth will depend  in part  upon its ability to complete development and successfully introduce these new tests 
the company expects to continue to incur negative cash flows from operations as it expands product research and development efforts for new test panels  pursues regulatory clearances and approvals  expands sales and marketing activities to address the therapeutic monitoring market  and develops and expands manufacturing capacity for existing and new test panels 
the development and commercialization of the new tests will require additional development  sales and marketing  manufacturing and other expenditures 
the required level and timing of such expenditures will have an impact on the company s ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operations 
results of operations years ended march  and march  revenues 
the company s revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while international revenues remained constant at million in both fiscal and the increase in domestic revenues reflects a continuing unit increase in sales of the disposable test cassettes and the cholestech ldx system to hospitals  managed care organizations  public health departments  corporations  physician office laboratories and other health care providers in the diagnostic screening and therapeutic monitoring markets 
as of march   the company had approximately  active health promotion accounts 
in april  the company launched its clinical laboratory improvement amendments of waived product line 
the company had shipped approximately  cholestech ldx systems into the physician office laboratory market as of march  the company is represented in the physician office laboratories market segment by physician sales and service  inc and general medical 
in the pharmacy market segment of therapeutic market the company is represented by amerisource health corporation 
international revenues as a percent of total revenues declined to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in international revenues as a percentage of total revenues reflects the substantial increase in domestic revenues from sales of the cholestech ldx system after the company s product had been granted waived status 
during fiscal  a single european distributor accounted for of the company s international revenues  a slight increase over in fiscal the company expects that international revenues will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as the company continues to increase sales and marketing efforts in the united states 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as sales of disposable test cassettes and the cholestech ldx system increased 
gross margin was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the improvement in the gross margin was primarily attributable to improved cassette manufacturing yields  growth in the volume of disposable test cassettes and the cholestech ldx system sold  without corresponding increases in costs  and improved quality assurance procedures 
the company has obtained rights to use certain technology in the manufacturing of certain of its products 
the related agreements  which expire at various times in calendar through  provide for the company to pay royalties ranging from to of net sales of the applicable products 
total royalty expense in fiscal  and were   and  respectively  and was charged to cost of products sold 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to continued development of additional tests and the increase in headcount to fourteen from four at the end of fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal year such decrease as a percentage of revenues resulted from faster revenue growth than the company s ability to responsibly build infrastructure 
the company is currently developing additional tests to detect disease states such as renal function  kidney function  metabolic bone diseases and disorders  liver function  prostate cancer and diabetes 
each of these new tests is at an early stage of development and the company will be required to undertake time consuming and costly development activities and seek regulatory approval for these new tests before such tests can be marketed 
however  the company believes that its future revenue growth and profitability will depend  in part  upon its ability to complete development and successfully introduce new test panels designed to extend the cholestech ldx system s capabilities to include additional tests useful in the diagnostic screening and therapeutic monitoring markets 
the company currently anticipates that research and development expenditures will increase significantly in future periods as product development and manufacturing scale up efforts for new tests increase 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase in sales and marketing expense were primarily attributable to continued expansion of the company s domestic sales and marketing organization  increased expenses related to the penetration in the therapeutic monitoring market  increased commissions associated with increased revenues and  to a lesser extent  participation in domestic conferences and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense fell to of total revenue in fiscal from of total revenues in fiscal due to revenue growth that out paced the company s ability to responsibly build its sales and marketing infrastructure 
the company currently anticipates that sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as the company continues to expand sales and marketing activities to address the therapeutic monitoring market  in particular the physician office laboratory and the pharmacy segments 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from higher professional fees relating to recruitment of key personnel  legal fees relating to business development efforts  and an increased investment in the company s information systems 
general and administrative expenses fell to of total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues occurred due to faster revenue growth than the company s ability to responsibly build its infrastructure 
interest income 
interest income reflects income from the investment of cash balances and marketable securities 
interest income rose to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the growth in interest income in fiscal over fiscal is primarily the result of investing the proceeds from the company s public offering of common stock in june interest expense 
interest expense is incurred on capital lease financings  the bank line of credit and long term debt 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the rise in interest expense in fiscal resulted primarily from the imposition of a prepayment penalty of  when the company retired its long term debt in the second quarter of fiscal years ended march  and march  revenues 
the company s total revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while international revenues increased by to million in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in total revenues reflected increased unit sales of the cholestech ldx system and disposable test cassettes to hospitals  managed care organizations  public health departments  corporations and other health care providers in the diagnostic screening market 
the company s product sales to the united states therapeutic monitoring market were minimal in each fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended march   international revenues increased  to million from  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in international revenue reflects the shipment of an unusual number of cholestech ldx system to europe in the fiscal year ended march  international revenues as a percent of total revenues declined slightly to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decline of international revenues as a percent of total revenues reflects the increase in domestic revenues in fiscal from fiscal during fiscal  a single european distributor accounted for of the company s international revenues 
no single international distributor accounted for a material percentage of international revenues in fiscal costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as unit sales of the cholestech ldx system and disposable test cassettes increased 
gross margin was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the improvement in the gross margin was primarily attributable to improved cassette manufacturing yields  improved quality assurance procedures and growth in the volume of units sold 
during fiscal  the company improved cassette manufacturing yields and quality assurance procedures and reduced staffing levels by eliminating technical and engineering positions specific to initial product development and scale up of manufacturing capacity 
the resulting manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions were reflected for the full year of fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses remained nearly constant at  from  between fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a result of the company s decision to concentrate available resources on expansion of sales and marketing activities for existing test panels 
as a result of the company s expanding sales of the cholestech ldx system and its cassettes without a corresponding increase in research and development expenditures  research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues fell to in fiscal from in fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to expansion of the company s domestic direct sales and marketing organization  increased commissions associated with increased product sales and  to a lesser extent  participation in domestic conferences and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense fell to of total revenues in fiscal from of total revenues in fiscal due to revenue growth that out paced the company s ability to responsibly build its sales and marketing infrastructure 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of reduced headcount and reduced expenditures for rent and insurance 
general and administrative expenses fell to to total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal these decreases in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues occurred due to faster revenue growth than the company s ability to responsibly build its infrastructure 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses included a one time charge of approximately  as a result of headcount reductions 
absent such one time charge  general and administrative expenses for fiscal would have been million 
interest income 
interest income was earned on investment of cash balances generated from prior equity financings of the company 
interest income rose slightly to  from  in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was incurred on capital lease financings  the bank line of credit and long term debt obtained by the company 
interest expense rose three fold to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to capital lease financings obtained by the company 
income tax carryforwards 
as of march   the company had net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce taxable income through for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  the company had research and development credit carryforwards available to reduce income taxes through for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and  respectively 
there is an annual limitation of approximately million for federal and state income tax reporting purposes on the use of approximately million and million of net operating losses  and of  and  of tax credit carryforwards  respectively 
the company s net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards incurred prior to december are subject to an annual limitation of approximately million for federal and state income tax reporting purposes on the use of approximately million and million of net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  and of million and  of tax credit carryforwards  respectively 
if the amounts of these limitations are not utilized in any year  the amount not utilized increases the allowable limit in the subsequent year 
impact of adoption of new accounting standards 
the company continues to account for its stock option and employee stock purchase plans in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board s opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas which established a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
under the terms of sfas  companies can elect to account for stock based compensation plans using the fair value method or continue measuring compensation expense for those plans using the intrinsic value method must make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method defined in sfas had been applied 
the company has adopted the disclosure method of sfas in fiscal and  consequently  sfas had no impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  through capital lease financing and a long term note payable 
through march   the company had raised approximately million in net proceeds from equity financings 
as of march   the company had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
in addition  the company has a million revolving bank line of credit 
while the agreement is in effect  the company is required to maintain on deposit assets with a collective value  as defined in the line of credit agreement  equivalent to no less than of the outstanding principal balance 
amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit agreement expires on november  and is renewable 
as of march   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary factor contributing to decrease in cash used in operations from year to year was the decrease in net losses  offset in part by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
accounts receivable  net  increased due to increased sales volume 
inventory increased primarily to support increased production ramps to meet increasing demand for products and for increases in finished goods inventory to support a larger installed base 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities reflected the company s purchases of property and equipment and purchases of short term marketable securities 
during fiscal  net cash used in investing activities reflected the company s purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the sales of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million reflects issuance of common stock  primarily from the public offering  offset in part by principal payments on capital leases  repayment of long term debt and repayment of short term bank borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal reflected approximately million in net proceeds from a note payable  borrowing under the line of credit and issuance of common stock while the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal reflected the repayment of capital lease obligations 
the company intends to expend substantial funds for product research and development  continued expansion of sales and marketing activities  expansion of manufacturing capacity and other working capital and general corporate purposes 
although the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities balances as of march   available bank line of credit  together with amounts to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing 
the company s actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of manufacturing capacity  the number and type of new tests the company seeks to develop  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the extent to which the company s existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the progress of commercialization efforts of the company s distributors  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters and clinical laboratory improvement amendments of  and other factors 
in the event that additional financing is needed  the company may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary  to raise additional funds  may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories 
the failure of the company to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
potential factors affecting future operating results history of losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since inception and as of march   had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations on annual and or a quarter to quarter basis in the future 
annual and or quarterly operating results will fluctuate due to numerous factors  such as i the timing and level of market acceptance of the cholestech ldx r system  particularly with respect to the therapeutic monitoring market  ii the timing of introduction and availability of new tests  iii the timing and level of expenditures associated with new product development activities  iv the timing and level of expenditures associated with expansion of sales and marketing activities and overall operations  v the company s ability to cost effectively expand cassette manufacturing capacity and maintain consistently acceptable yields in the manufacture of disposable test cassettes  vi the timing of establishment of strategic distribution arrangements and the success of the activities conducted under such arrangements  vii variations in manufacturing efficiencies  viii changes in demand for its products based on changes in third party reimbursement  competition  changes in government regulation and other factors  ix the timing of significant orders from and shipments to customers  and x general economic conditions 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in annual and or quarterly demand for products may adversely affect the continuity of the company s manufacturing operations  increase uncertainty in operational planning  and or affect cash flow from operations 
the company s expenses are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenue levels and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
if actual revenues do not meet expectations  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
uncertainty of market acceptance of the cholestech ldx system 
the company has generated revenues to date  primarily from sales of the cholestech ldx system to hospitals  public health departments  corporate wellness programs  health promotion service providers  managed care organizations  community health centers  the military  others in the diagnostic screening market and therapeutic monitoring market 
in order for the company to increase revenues  achieve sustained profitability and maintain positive cash flows from operations  the cholestech ldx system must achieve a significant degree of market acceptance among health care providers in the therapeutic monitoring market  particularly physician office laboratories 
physicians and other health care providers are not likely to use the cholestech ldx system unless they determine that it is an attractive alternative to other means of diagnostic screening or therapeutic monitoring blood detected diseases 
even if the advantages of the cholestech ldx system in diagnosing and therapeutic monitoring patients with blood detected diseases are established  physicians  medical clinics  pharmacists and other health care providers may elect not to purchase and use the cholestech ldx system for any number of reasons 
as a result  there can be no assurance that demand for the cholestech ldx system  particularly in the therapeutic monitoring market  will be sufficient to allow for profitable operations 
dependence on development and introduction of new products 
the company is in the early stages of developing tests designed to extend the cholestech ldx system s capability to include additional tests useful to health care providers  particularly physician office laboratories 
the company believes that its revenue growth and future profitability will depend  in part  upon its ability to complete development of and successfully introduce these new tests 
the company will be required to undertake time consuming and costly development activities and seek regulatory approval for these new tests 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new tests  that regulatory clearance or approval of any new tests will be granted by the fda or the centers for disease control and prevention for waived status on a timely basis  if at all  or that new tests will adequately meet the requirements of the applicable market or achieve market acceptance 
in order to successfully commercialize any new tests  the company will be required to establish and maintain reliable  cost efficient  high volume manufacturing capacity for such tests 
the company has in the past encountered difficulties in scaling up production of new test cassettes  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  variations and impurities in the raw materials and performance of the manufacturing equipment 
if the company is unable for technological or other reasons to complete the development  introduction and scale up of manufacturing of any new tests or if such new tests do not achieve a significant level of market acceptance  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
limited sales  marketing and distribution experience  dependence on third party distributors 
in order for the company to increase revenues and achieve sustainable profitability  the cholestech ldx system must achieve a significant degree of market acceptance among health care providers in the monitoring market  particularly physician office laboratories and pharmacy market segments 
the company has only limited experience in marketing and selling to the monitoring market in the united states 
the company has recently entered into distribution arrangement with two national distributors  general medical and amerisource 
the company may be required to enter into additional distribution arrangements in order to achieve broad distribution of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into and maintain arrangements with additional distributors on a timely basis  if at all 
the company will be dependent upon these distributors to assist it in promoting market acceptance that these distributors will devote the resources necessary to provide effective sales and marketing support to the company 
in addition  the company distributors may give higher priority to the products of other medical suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell the company s products 
if the company is unable to establish appropriate arrangements with distributors or if any of the company s distributors become unwilling or unable to promote  market and sell the cholestech ldx system and disposable test cassettes  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with cassette manufacturing 
the company internally manufactures all the disposable test cassettes that are components of the cholestech ldx system 
the manufacture of the disposable test cassettes is a highly complex and precise process 
such manufacturing is sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including variations and impurities in the raw materials  difficulties in the manufacturing process  performance of the manufacturing equipment and the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment 
the company has in the past experienced lower than expected production yields that have adversely affected gross margins and delayed product shipments 
the company believes that it may be required to expand manufacturing capacity for new and existing test cassettes 
there can be no assurance that such expansion of cassette manufacturing capacity can be completed in a timely fashion  if ever 
in addition  the company may be required to build a new cassette manufacturing line for the immunoassay test cassettes under development 
to date  the company has not developed the core technologies  processes and productions equipment for an immunoassay cassette manufacturing line 
to the extent the company does not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of disposable test cassettes or experiences product shipment delays  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
highly competitive industry  rapid technological change 
the diagnostic screening and therapeutic monitoring markets in which the company competes is intensely competitive 
the company s competition consists mainly of independent clinical laboratories and hospital based laboratories  as well as manufacturers of bench top and other preventive care systems 
in order to achieve market acceptance for the cholestech ldx system  the company will be required to demonstrate that the cholestech ldx system is an attractive alternative to the clinical laboratory and hospital based laboratory  as well as bench top and other preventive care systems 
this will require physicians to change their established means of having such tests performed 
the company expects that the reclassification of the cholestech ldx system as waived under clinical laboratory improvement amendments of will result in competitors seeking to develop products that qualify for waived classification 
the company expects that such competitors will compete intensely to maintain and increase their market shares 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in obtaining clinical laboratory improvement amendments of waived status for their products or in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective and commercially attractive than the company s current or future products  or that would render the company s technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
there can be no assurance that the cholestech ldx system will be able to compete with the testing services provided by these laboratories and analyzers 
dependence on proprietary technology  uncertainty of patent and proprietary technology protection  dependence on license of technology of third parties 
the company s ability to compete effectively will depend in part on its ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of its technology  and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
cholestech has eight united states patents and one foreign issued patent and is currently prosecuting several patent applications with certain foreign patent offices 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents  or that  if issued  any assurance that any patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future or that the rights created thereunder will provide a competitive advantage 
the medical products industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings conducted in the uspto to determine the priority of inventions 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which the company may become a party could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties or require the company to seek licenses from parties which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
government regulation 
the manufacture and sale of diagnostic products  including the cholestech ldx system  are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
the company will not be able to commence marketing or commercial sales in the united states of any of the new tests until it receives clearance or approval from the fda 
additionally  certain material changes to medical products already cleared or approved by the fda are also subject to further fda review and clearance or approval 
the loss of previously obtained clearances  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in general  the company intends to develop and market tests that will require k clearance 
it generally takes from four to twelve months from the date of submission to obtain k clearance  but it can take longer 
in addition  certain of the company s products under development  such as the psa test  may require submission of a pre market approval application which is much longer and more costly process and involves the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information 
a pre market approval application may be submitted to the fda only after clinical trials and the required patient follow up for a particular test are successfully completed 
upon filing of a pre market approval application  the fda commences a review process that generally takes one to three years from the date on which the pre market approval application is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer 
there can be no assurance that the company s products under development will require only k clearance rather than the more lengthy pre market approval approval 
a requirement that the company file a pre market approval application for a new test would significantly delay the company s ability to market such test and significantly increase the costs of development 
sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval to market medical devices may be shorter or longer than that required for fda approval  and the requirements could differ 
such requirements could adversely effect the company s ability to sell its products internationally 
the use of cholestech s products and those of its competitors is also affected by clinical laboratory improvement amendments of and related federal and state regulations  which provide for regulation of laboratory testing 
the scope of these regulations includes quality control  proficiency testing  personnel standards and federal inspections 
clinical laboratory improvement amendments of categorizes tests as waived  or as being moderately complex or highly complex  on the basis of specific criteria 
in january  the cholestech ldx system and the total cholesterol  high density lipoprotein cholesterol  triglycerides and glucose tests in any combination were reclassified as waived under clinical laboratory improvement amendments of in order to successfully commercialize the tests that are currently under development  the company believes that it will be critical to obtain waived classification for such tests under clinical laboratory improvement amendments of there can be no assurance that any new tests developed by the company will qualify for the waived classification 
any failure of the new tests to obtain waived status under clinical laboratory improvement amendments of will adversely impact the company s ability to commercialize such tests  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement 
in the united states  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians  that purchase diagnostic products such as the company s system  generally rely on third party payers  principally private health insurance plans  federal medicare and state medicaid  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the product is being used 
the company s ability to commercialize its products successfully in the united states will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatment will be available from government health authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
such third party payers can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of the company s products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement provided by such payers for testing services 
reimbursement is currently available for the company s current product line of disposable test cassettes 
the cost of the cholestech ldx system is generally not subject to reimbursement by government and other third party payers 
in addition  the tests performed by public health departments  corporate wellness programs and other large volume users in the screening market are generally not subject to reimbursement 
in addition  certain health care providers are moving towards a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per patient 
failure by physicians and other users to obtain reimbursement from third party payers  or changes in government and private third party payers policies toward reimbursement of test employing the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
given the efforts to control and reduce health care costs in the united states in recent years  there can be no assurance that currently available levels of reimbursement will continue to be available in the future for the company s existing products or products under development 
in addition  market acceptance of the company s products in international markets is dependent  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
dependence on suppliers 
certain key components and raw materials used in manufacturing of the company s products are currently provided by single source vendors 
any supply interruption in a single source component or raw material would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture products until a new source of supply were qualified 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in qualifying additional sources on a timely basis or at all  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  an uncorrected impurity or supplier s variation in a raw material  either unknown to the company or incompatible with the company s manufacturing process  could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture products 
also  because the company is a small customer of many of its suppliers  there can be no assurance that suppliers will devote adequate resources to supplying the company s needs 
any interruption or reduction in the future supply of any key components or raw materials currently obtained from single or limited sources could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition in any given period 
dependence on retention and attraction of key employees 
the company s success depends in significant part upon the continued service of certain key scientific  technical  regulatory and managerial personnel  and its continuing ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified scientific  technical  clinical  regulatory and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain such personnel or that it can attract or retain other highly qualified scientific  technical  clinical  regulatory and managerial personnel in the future  including key sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of product liability  product liability insurance may be insufficient or unavailable 
sale of the company s products entails risk of product liability claims 
the medical testing industry has historically been litigious  and the company faces financial exposure to product liability claims in the event that use of its products result in personal injury 
the company also faces the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of its products might necessitate a product recall 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and million annually in the aggregate  and there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of the company s insurance policies will be adequate 
such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
no assurance can be given that product liability insurance can be maintained in the future at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect the company against losses due to liability 
in addition  a product liability claim in excess of relevant insurance coverage or product recall could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
issuance of preferred stock could delay or prevent corporate takeover 
the board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
to date  the board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with the company s shareholder rights plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of common stock 
on january   pursuant to a preferred shares rights agreement the rights agreement between the company and chasemellon shareholder services  l 
l 
c 
the rights agent  the company s board of directors declared a dividend of one right a right to purchase on one thousandth share of the company s series a participating preferred stock series a preferred for each outstanding share of common stock of the company 
the dividend was payable on march  the record date to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that day 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company on one thousandth of a share of series a preferred at an exercise price of the purchase price  subject to adjustment 
the rights approved by the board are designed to protect and maximize the value of the outstanding equity interests in the company in the event of an unsolicited attempt by an acquirer to take over the company  in a manner or on terms not approved by the board of directors 
the rights have been declared by the board in order to deter coercive tactics  including a gradual accumulation of shares in the open market of a or greater position to be followed by a merger or a partial or two tier tender offer that does not treat all stockholders equally 
the rights should not interfere with any merger or business combination approved by the board of directors 
however  the rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the company deemed undesirable by the board of directors 
the rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the company on terms or in a manner not approved by the company s board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights 
potential volatility of stock price 
the market price of shares of common stock  like that of the common stock of many other medical products and high technology companies  has in the past been  and is likely in the future to continue to be highly volatile 
factors such as fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by the company or competitors  government regulation  changes in the current structure of the health care financing and payment systems  developments in or disputes regarding patent or other proprietary rights  economic and other external factors and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock 
moreover  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market prices for medical products and high technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
