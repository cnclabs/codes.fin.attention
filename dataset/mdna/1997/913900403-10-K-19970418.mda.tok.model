gross margins for for only deals were of net sales compared to of net sales for gross margins for for odd s n end s were of net sales compared to of net sales for  excluding the impact of intercompany profit under the supply agreement with universal  which has been eliminated in consolidation 
retail gross margins decreased due primarily to higher than planned markdowns of seasonal merchandise in the first quarter of and increased promotional pricing during the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in this increase primarily resulted from the significant increase in retail operations  which incur higher operating costs than wholesale operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the wholesale business to of net sales compared to of net sales in the increase in these expenses as a percent of sales in the wholesale business was primarily due to the decline in wholesale sales  since most of the wholesale operating costs are relatively fixed 
selling  general and administrative expenses for only deals increased by million in due primarily to the addition of nine and retail stores during and  respectively

selling  general and administrative expenses for asset based services were  for interest expense interest expense increased to  in compared to  in due to an increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility to support the only deals expansion and to fund odd s n end s working capital needs

the company recorded  of equity in net loss of the joint venture  its proportionate share of the joint venture s net loss through december  management believes that the equity in net income loss of the joint venture will not be significant in income taxes the company is in a net operating loss carryforward position with no remaining carryback available 
net loss the company incurred a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in the net loss in was primarily due to costs incurred to build the infrastructure necessary to implement the significant increase in retail stores  costs incurred to open new only deals stores in  lower than planned retail sales and gross margins  a highly promotional retail environment  lower wholesale net sales  and equity in the net loss of the joint venture 
other while an increase in competition has impacted the company s business  the effects of this competition are minor compared to weakness in the retail environment and overall consumer demand 
additionally  although the close out industry is growing as consumers become more value conscious  the industry is becoming more competitive  thus making sales growth harder to achieve 
as more companies enter the wholesale close out industry  the company expects that there will be increased competition to both buy and sell goods 
compared to net sales overall net sales for the company in increased to million  a increase from net sales of million for net sales for in the wholesale business decreased million to million  a decrease from  due primarily to sales to odd s n end s which were eliminated in consolidation in sales to odd s n end s reflected as wholesale sales in totaled million 
accordingly  excluding the effect of sales to odd s n end s in  the company realized approximately a  increase in wholesale sales in net sales for by only deals increased to million  an increase from this increase was primarily due to the addition of nine new stores in the second half of and because two stores were open the entire year of versus a partial year in  offset by a decrease resulting from closing six stores in early net sales for  therefore  increased primarily due to the full consolidation of net sales of odd s n end s of million 
at december   the company had only deals retail stores in operation including two stores reserved for closing compared to including eight stores reserved for closing at december  at december   odd s n end s had retail stores in operation 
one only deals store and one odd s n end s store were closed in january gross margins gross margins for increased to million  a increase over gross margins of million for gross margins for in the wholesale business were of wholesale net sales  versus in the increase in wholesale gross margins as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to maintaining targeted selling price levels  the improvement in the overall quality of the company s inventory  and a broader selection of higher margin merchandise 
gross margins for for only deals were of net sales compared to of net sales for gross margins for for odd s n end s were of net sales  excluding the impact of intercompany profit under the supply agreement with universal  which has been eliminated in consolidation 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  in the wholesale business to of net sales compared to of net sales in the increase in these expenses in the wholesale business was primarily the result of increased costs relating to supplying merchandise to odd s n end s for the full year in versus only a partial year in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  for only deals in to of net sales compared to of net sales in this decrease was primarily due to reduced costs related to closing six stores in early and the reduction in the provision for losses on store closings from  in to zero in offset by increased costs related to opening nine stores in the second half of selling  general and administrative expenses in  therefore  increased primarily due to the consolidation of selling  general and administrative expenses in the odd s n end s subsidiary of million or of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses are lower in the odd s n end s subsidiary as a percentage of net sales compared to only deals due to the elimination of the warehousing and transportation functions at odd s n end s because those functions are provided by the company 
interest expense interest expense increased to  in compared to  in due primarily to higher borrowing levels of the company to support increasing business as well as to fund advances to odd s n end s 
in addition  interest expense in includes  from odd s n end s bank notes payable 
income taxes the company utilized net operating loss carryforwards in to reduce the provision for income taxes 
the  provision recorded in represents alternative minimum taxes due for federal and state tax purposes 
the company is in a net operating loss carryforward position with no remaining carryback available 
net income loss the company generated net income of million in versus a net loss of million during the improved results of operations in are primarily due to improved wholesale margins  additional sales from nine new only deals store openings and improved comparable store sales 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company entered into a borrowing arrangement whereby a financial institution agreed to lend the company up to million under a revolving credit agreement originally expiring in january the company may borrow against a borrowing base derived from the level of qualifying accounts receivable and inventory 
the amount available at december   based on the borrowing base  was  of which there were outstanding borrowings of  and outstanding letters of credit of  the line of credit agreement and related documents restrict the company from declaring cash dividends  require maintenance of a minimum net worth amount  limit the amount of advances to odd s n end s and limit the amount of annual capital expenditures 
during  the lender waived certain technical defaults under the agreement  and the expiration date of the agreement was amended to march  subsequent to december   the company was in technical default on several provisions of the amended loan agreement 
as a result of these defaults  the lender reduced the credit line to million and increased the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings from prime plus the prime rate at december  was to prime plus 
the loan agreement is continuing subject to monthly renewals  however  the lender has indicated its intent to further reduce the credit line to million as of april  and million as of may  the outstanding borrowings on the line totaled  as of march  the company is currently in the process of negotiating financing with a number of new potential lenders to replace its current credit line and to refinance the odd s n end s bank notes payable  which currently include balloon payments of  on january  management believes that a new credit facility will be obtained in the near future 
the above described conditions  as well as the company s operating results for  raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the company is also in the process of substantially reducing the wholesale inventories and restructuring and downsizing wholesale operations to minimize the impact of the reduction of the credit line and to focus more company resources on retail operations 
management believes that a significant reduction in inventories together with a new credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy the company s planned operating requirements through december  however  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain replacement financing or  if available  that the amount obtained will be equal to the present line of credit or that the terms will be satisfactory 
at december   the company had working capital of million compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to classification of million of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement as a current liability at december  that was reflected as a long term liability at december  net cash used by operating activities was million for the year ended december  versus net cash used by operating activities of million for the year ended december  inventories increased million in  net of shrink and obsolescence  and accounts payable increased million 
inventories increased million in  net of shrink and obsolescence  and accounts payable increased approximately  inventories increased million in in the odd s n end s retail locations to a more historically normal level 
in addition  only deals inventories increased to support the increased retail space in and  and wholesale inventories increased to support the increased needs of only deals and odd s n end s 
accounts payable increased due to substantially increased operations and increased inventory levels in net cash used by investing activities of million in was primarily related to opening new only deals stores 
net cash used by investing activities of million in was primarily related to opening nine new only deals stores and partially remodeling a majority of the odd s n end s stores 
the million used by operating activities  the million for additions to equipment and improvements  primarily for expansion of the only deals chain  and the million payments of long term debt were funded by a million increase in borrowings under the revolving credit agreement during the company has an agreement which  as amended  provides for advances of up to million to odd s n end s  collateralized by a secondary interest in substantially all assets  with interest payable at prime plus 
there were advances totaling  under this agreement as of december  in march  the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire the leases and inventory of approximately retail stores and a warehouse from perry brothers  inc  of lufkin  texas 
the purchase agreement is contingent upon further due diligence and the company obtaining both equity and debt financing to complete the transaction 
to complete the perry brothers acquisition  the company will need an investor who will purchase a significant equity position in the company 
if the company issues equity securities to such an investor  existing shareholders will experience dilution 
the company does not intend to open any new only deals stores in the company expects to focus its attention on obtaining new financing  managing the substantial growth in new only deals stores from  and pursuing the potential acquisition of perry brothers 
the company does not expect to have any significant capital expenditures in effects of inflation in the company s business of buying and selling close out merchandise  each purchase is individually negotiated based upon the price at which the company feels the product can be resold 
therefore  since inflation generally will affect overall price levels similarly in the types of merchandise the company purchases  the impact of inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s overall buying or selling opportunities 
new accounting standard the company plans to adopt the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share  in the fourth quarter of the company does not believe that the adoption of this new accounting standard will have a significant impact on its financial statements
