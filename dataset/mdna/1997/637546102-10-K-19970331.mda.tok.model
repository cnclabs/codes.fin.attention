item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
results of operations consolidated results of operations consolidated net income from the national security group was million in compared to  in million in 
consolidated revenues were million in compared to million in million in 
industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s three segments life and accident and health insurance  property and casualty insurance  and other is summarized as follows premium revenues life and accident and health insurance    property and casualty insurance    income before taxes and cumulative effect adjustment life and accident and health insurance  property and casualty insurance   other life and accident and health insurance operations premium income was million in  down from million in  as a result of decreased sales of both  life insurance  and accident and health insurance 
the primary reason for the decrease is due to reductions in field agents and losses of significant amounts of business in mississippi 
premium income was down for compared to the primary reason for this decrease was due to a reduction of more than in the life insurance sales force during and early as it is becoming increasingly difficult to hire and maintain high quality home service agents  the life company expects to make some changes in its method of selling new life insurance products in the near future 
as a result of the decrease in the life insurance sales force  general expenses before litigation and sales commissions fell slightly in compared to sales commissions dropped from million in to million in general expenses before litigation costs decreased in compared to primarily due to decreased legal expenses and insurance expenses 
general expenses before litigation cost in declined  compared to  a decrease 
pretax earnings were much improved in at million compared to  in the primary reason for the improvement was that litigation expenses decreased by over million 
pretax earnings of  in compared to  in  reflected a decrease in realized investment gains  and a continued hostile legal environment 
litigation expenses totaled million and million in and respectively 
property casualty operations premium income was million in compared to million in the primary reason for the increase was due to the increase in premiums from new commercial and private passenger automobile programs in the states of louisiana  and georgia 
growth from these programs is expected to continue in though at more moderate levels than in the property casualty subsidiaries are expected to expand automobile insurance into two additional states by mid to late these programs are still in the planning stages at this point and premium projections are not yet available 
premium income of million in  was down nearly from the total of million  a result of the decision to discontinue a commercial automobile program during and a private passenger automobile program in pretax earnings were million in up from  in earnings were up primarily due to the adverse impact of hurricane opal on earnings 
earnings in were still below previous levels due to increased fire and windstorm losses in the low value dwelling program 
pretax earnings of  in were down from the total of million 
several factors contributed to the decrease in earnings in  the most noteworthy of which was hurricane opal which ripped through alabama  where more than of property and casualty net written premiums are produced 
total property losses incurred by the company exceeded million 
however  after catastrophe reinsurance recoveries  the pretax loss was about million 
also contributing to the decrease in pretax earnings was a change in alabama s insurance premium tax law which led to an increase in premium taxes of more than  litigation settlements and legal expenses were more than  in  and the decrease in premium revenues accounted for the remainder of the decrease in pretax income 
a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the statutory combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measurers losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premiums earned 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measurers underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums written during the year 
the results of these ratios for the past three years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the combined ratio for  though improved over was still higher than historical averages for the property casualty subsidiaries 
the primary reason for the high combined ratio was higher than normal incurred losses in the low value dwelling program in the first quarter of these losses were attributable to the colder than normal winter which led to more fire losses and several tornado producing storms which hit the southeastern united states 
the combined ratio for increased significantly over due to losses sustained in hurricane opal 
maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane  such as opal  hitting the coast of alabama  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the fire casualty subsidiary maintains catastrophe insurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
asset portfolio review the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to national association of insurance commissioners naic securities valuation office svo rating standards  and the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of moody s and standard and poor s svo equivalents of total svo class moody s standard and poor s bond portfolio aaa to a aaa to a baa to baa bbb to bbb ba to ba bb to bb b to b b to b caa to ca ccc to c c ci to d as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement and reclassified a portion of its fixed maturity securities portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder being classified as held tomaturity 
with that reclassification  the fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and changes in fair values  net of related income taxes  are charged or credited to shareholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed bonds  primarily collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  of million at december  and the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
the company limits the extent of its credit risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are guaranteed by us government sponsored entities 
also  substantially all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higherrisk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of loss of principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on net worth for a sustained period of time  and low price to book value or low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investment  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicate that operating activities provided used cash of million  million  million in   and respectively 
those statements also classify the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities  and financing activities and disclose the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet the company s obligations 
the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by operating activities for was the increased cash flow from the new automobile programs 
the primary reason for the large increase in cash used for operating activities in was hurricane opal which hit alabama in early october 
the cash provided from the sale of available for sale securities helped offset the increase in cash required to pay hurricane claims 
the company has standby letters of credit in the amount of  these letters are used to guarantee obligations of the property casualty subsidiary under assumed reinsurance contracts 
the letters of credit are secured by certain invested assets of the company 
the company also routinely incurs liability for declared but unpaid dividends 
long term liquidity needs of the company constitute only those items which are directly related to the principal business operations of the company 
the company has no long term debt 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
on december   the company had no known impairments of assets or changes in operation which would have a material adverse effect upon liquidity 
approximately of the company s assets are invested in cash  investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and broadly traded equity securities which are highly liquid 
the values of these investments are subject to the conditions of the markets in which they are traded 
past fluctuations in these markets have had little effect on the liquidity of the company 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect in its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and million in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
however  that condition poses no short term or long term liquidity concerns for the parent company 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula will be used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of eight to one at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements
