see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for international segment data concerning revenues  operating income loss and identifiable assets 
the recovery audit industry large businesses with substantial volumes of purchase transactions involving multiple vendors  numerous discounts and allowances  fluctuating prices and complex pricing arrangements find it difficult to detect all payment errors 
these businesses include retailers  such as discount  department  specialty  grocery and drug stores  wholesale distributors  manufacturers and distributors of high technology products and certain governmental agencies and healthcare providers 
although these businesses process the vast majority of payment transactions correctly  a small number of errors occur principally because of communication failures between purchasing and payables departments  personnel turnover and changes in information and accounting systems 
these errors include vendor pricing errors  missed or inaccurate discounts  allowances and rebates  incorrect freight charges and duplicate payments 
in the aggregate  these transaction errors can represent meaningful lost profits  especially for businesses with relatively narrow profit margins 
although internal recovery audit departments identify some accounts payable errors  independent recovery audit firms often are retained by these businesses to identify additional overpayments 
in the us  large retailers routinely engage independent recovery audit firms as standard business practice 
outside the us  large retailers increasingly are retaining independent recovery audit firms 
the us retailing industry represented approximately trillion in revenues in the top retailers worldwide had aggregate revenues of approximately trillion in the company believes that a typical us retailer makes payment errors that are not discovered internally  which in the aggregate can range from several hundred thousand dollars to more than million per billion dollars of revenues 
in addition  the company believes that large transaction intensive businesses other than retailers also make accounts payable errors 
increasingly  businesses use technology to manage complex accounts payable systems and realize greater operating efficiencies 
many businesses worldwide communicate with vendors electronically to exchange inventory and sales data  transmit purchase orders  submit invoices  forward shipping and receiving information and remit payments 
these paperless transactions are widely referred to as edi electronic data interchange and the company believes that implementation of this technology is accelerating 
edi streamlines processing large numbers of transactions  but does not eliminate payment errors because operator input errors may be replicated automatically in thousands of transactions 
edi systems typically generate significantly more individual transaction details in electronic form  making these transactions easier to audit than traditional paper based accounts payable systems 
recovery audit firms  however  require sophisticated technology in order to audit edi accounts payable processes effectively 
many transaction intensive businesses historically have maintained internal recovery audit departments that review transactions before engaging independent recovery audit firms 
the company believes that these businesses increasingly are outsourcing internal recovery functions to independent recovery audit firms 
factors contributing to this trend include i a need for significant investments in technology  especially in an edi environment  which the company believes are greater than even large businesses often can justify  ii an inability to duplicate the breadth of industry and auditing expertise of independent recovery audit firms  iii a desire to focus limited resources on core competencies  and iv a desire for larger and more timely recoveries 
the domestic and international recovery audit industry is characterized by several large and many small  local or regional firms 
most local and regional recovery audit firms lack the centralized resources or broad client base to support technology investments required to provide comprehensive recovery audit services for large  complex accounts payable systems 
these firms are even less equipped to audit large edi accounts payable systems 
in addition  because of limited resources  most of these firms subcontract work to third parties and may lack experience and the knowledge of national promotions  seasonal allowances and current recovery audit practices 
as a result  the company believes significant opportunities exist for recovery audit firms with a national and international presence  well trained and experienced professionals and the advanced technology required to audit increasingly complex accounts payable systems 
the profit recovery group solution the company provides its domestic and international clients with comprehensive recovery audit services by using sophisticated proprietary technology and advanced audit techniques and methodologies  and by employing highly trained  experienced recovery audit specialists 
as a result  the company believes it is able to identify significantly more payment errors in both traditional paper based and edi accounts payable systems 
by leveraging its technology investment across a large client base  the company is able to continue developing proprietary software tools and expand its technology leadership in the recovery audit industry 
the company is a leader in developing and utilizing sophisticated software audit tools and techniques that enhance the identification and recovery of payment errors 
in edi accounts payable systems  the company s proprietary software audit tools and data processing capabilities enable auditors to sort  filter and evaluate transactions in greater line item detail 
the company has developed and continuously updates and refines its proprietary databases that serve as a central repository reflecting its auditors experiences  vendor practices and knowledge of regional and national pricing information  including seasonal allowances  discounts and rebates 
these proprietary databases do not include confidential client information 
the company s technology provides a uniform platform for its auditors to offer consistent and proven audit techniques and methodologies regardless of the client s size  industry or geographic scope of operations 
the company also is a leader in establishing new recovery audit practices to reflect evolving industry trends 
the company s auditors are highly trained and many have joined the company from finance related management positions in the retailing industry 
to support its auditors  the company provides data processing  marketing  training and administrative services 
the profit recovery group strategy the company s objective is to become the leading worldwide provider of recovery audit services 
the company believes that it will have to increase significantly its revenues to achieve this objective 
its strategy consists of the following elements expand international presence 
the company believes international markets represent significant business opportunities and intends to expand its international presence 
for example  based on sales  of the top retailers worldwide were headquartered outside the us through sales and marketing efforts  the company targets countries having a concentration of large transaction intensive businesses 
the company also enters new international markets by supporting its us clients international operations 
during  the company commenced operations in australia  germany and new zealand 
expand client base 
the company seeks to increase its worldwide retail client base and expand its recovery audit services to other transaction intensive industries such as transportation  telecommunications and financial services 
the company recently has expanded its recovery audit services to the healthcare and high technology industries 
the company believes that its proprietary technology and audit techniques and methodologies also can be applied to these industries 
the company believes that its ability to attract new clients is enhanced because under the typical fee arrangement  the client pays a contractually negotiated percentage of overpayments recovered for clients 
the company intends to leverage existing client relationships into new audit engagements for clients other operating units 
based on retail sales  of the top retailers worldwide  each of which had sales of at least billion  were clients of the company in although the company targets clients principally with million or more in annual revenues  smaller businesses may be suitable clients if they are sufficiently transaction intensive and offer significant growth prospects 
maintain high client retention rates 
the company intends to maintain and improve its high client retention rate by providing comprehensive recovery audit services  utilizing highly trained auditors  and by continuing to refine its advanced audit technology 
of the company s accounts payable audit clients in from which the company derived revenues exceeding  continued to utilize the company s services in maintain technology leadership 
the company believes its proprietary technology provides a significant competitive advantage  especially in audits of edi accounts payable systems 
the company intends to continue making substantial investments in technology to maintain its leadership position and systems capabilities 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
the company intends to pursue the acquisition of domestic and international businesses including both direct competitors and businesses providing complementary recovery audit services 
as examples  in january  the company successfully completed the acquisition of fial associates  inc  a direct competitor  in january  the company acquired shaps group  inc  a firm providing recovery audit services to manufacturers and high technology companies  and in february  the company acquired accounts payable recovery services  inc  a firm providing recovery audit services to healthcare entities and energy companies 
the company may pursue much larger acquisitions in the future than those consummated to date 
promote outsourcing arrangements 
the company seeks to capitalize on the growing trend of businesses to outsource internal recovery audit efforts 
the company believes that its outsourcing clients benefit significantly from these arrangements because their recoveries generally are larger and completed more quickly 
the company further believes that as clients convert their systems to edi  outsourcing arrangements involving recovery audit work will become increasingly prevalent due in part to the absence of traditional audit trail documents 
the profit recovery group services the company provides comprehensive accounts payable and other ancillary recovery audit services 
in  accounts payable recovery audit services represented approximately of the company s revenues 
accounts payable recovery audit services using its proprietary technology  audit techniques and methodologies  the company conducts either primary or secondary accounts payable audits 
in primary audits  the company is the first independent recovery audit firm engaged 
in secondary audits  the company audits behind another independent recovery audit firm 
in  approximately of the number of the accounts payable audits conducted by the company were primary audits 
primary audits 
although the company is flexible in structuring recovery audit programs to meet the individual needs of its clients  there are two basic types of primary accounts payable audits conducted by the company i periodic audits  which are usually performed nine to months after a client s fiscal year end  and ii continuous audits  marketed as recovernow  which are performed more closely following transaction dates 
in most periodic audits  which constitute the vast majority of the company s present audit engagements  the client s internal recovery audit department conducts a preliminary review of accounts payable records to identify payment errors 
upon completion of the client s internal recovery audit review process  which may be as long as nine to months after the client s fiscal year end  the company begins its independent recovery audit 
under the company s recovernow program  clients provide the company with accounts payable data on a regular basis  often within days following the payment transaction 
the company believes its recovernow program generates larger client recoveries for several reasons  including i transaction data  especially paper based records  are more complete and accessible  ii the impact of vendor bankruptcies is minimized because claims are made more timely and continuously throughout the year  and iii certain recoveries are facilitated when claims are made prior to the expiration of seasonal or other special pricing promotions 
in addition  vendor relationships are improved because of timely communications regarding billing and payment practices 
in some cases  the company s clients outsource all or a portion of their internal recovery audit functions to the company 
in these cases  the client does not conduct an internal review prior to the company s audit 
in its outsourcing engagements  the company also may use client staff in the review process 
the company believes that more businesses will outsource their recovery audit functions in an effort to control personnel and technology costs  focus resources on their core business functions  and increase recoveries 
secondary audits 
in secondary audits  the company conducts an accounts payable audit after another independent recovery audit firm has completed its audit 
the company usually receives a higher percentage recovery fee than received from primary audits because it generally is more difficult to detect payment errors in secondary audits 
in most cases  the company is able to identify significant payment errors not previously detected by a client s primary independent recovery audit firm 
the company utilizes secondary audits as a marketing strategy to obtain new  primary audit clients and believes it has been successful in implementing this strategy 
of the secondary audit clients served in which individually provided revenues to the company exceeding  were converted to primary audit clients prior to december  ancillary audit services in addition to accounts payable recovery audit services  the company also offers ancillary recovery audit services 
these ancillary services may be offered individually or in conjunction with accounts payable recovery audit services 
freight audits 
the company provides domestic freight audits using freightpro  the company s proprietary freight recovery audit software 
the company also maintains centralized domestic freight and shipping databases and has auditors who specialize in freight audits 
freight audits are usually conducted in conjunction with accounts payable recovery audits 
lease compliance audits 
real estate lease and landlord compliance audits involve an examination of all aspects of a client s facility lease arrangements to assist the client in identifying lease overpayments or expenses incurred through landlord noncompliance with lease terms 
telecommunications audits 
this program assists clients in reducing their overall telecommunications costs 
for example  overpayments often can result from the incorrect application of rates and tariffs 
auditors also review clients equipment  usage and systems configuration needs and make recommendations on how to reduce future telecommunications costs 
utility audits 
auditors also review clients electrical and natural gas requirements and analyze alternative rates and billing plans to verify that billing was proper and that the proper tariff rate was applied 
client contracts the company s standard client contract provides that the company is entitled to a contractual percentage of overpayments recovered for clients 
clients generally recover claims by taking credits against outstanding payables or future purchases from the involved vendors 
in many cases  the company s auditors work on site with client personnel and continually monitor credits taken 
in other situations  company auditors schedule periodic reconciliations with clients to determine which claims have been processed for credit 
the company s standard client contract imposes a duty on the client to process promptly all claims against vendors 
in the interest of maintaining good vendor relations  however  many clients modify the standard client contract with the company to provide that they retain discretion on whether to pursue collection of a claim 
in the company s experience  it is extremely unusual for a client to forego the collection of a large  valid claim 
in some cases  a vendor may dispute a claim by providing additional documentation or information supporting its position 
consequently  many clients revise the company s standard client contract to clarify that the company is not entitled to payment of its fee until the client recovers the claim from its vendor 
in addition to the client contracts  most clients establish specific procedural guidelines that the company must satisfy prior to submitting claims for client approval 
these guidelines are unique to each client and impose specific requirements on the company prior to submitting claims 
the company recognizes revenues at the time overpayment claims are presented to and approved by its clients  as adjusted for estimated uncollectible claims 
estimated uncollectible claims initially are established  and subsequently adjusted  for each individual client based on a number of factors including historical experience 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
technology the company believes that its proprietary software audit tools and proprietary databases  together with its centralized data processing capabilities  provide it a competitive advantage over smaller local and regional firms  especially when auditing complex edi accounts payable systems 
the company has devoted more than five years and has made substantial financial investments in developing its proprietary technology 
at december   the company s information services department had employees  of whom were dedicated to software development activities  including updating and modifying the company s existing proprietary software 
centralized data preparation and verification at the beginning of a typical audit  magnetic media containing accounts payable transaction data are delivered to the company s central data processing facility 
experienced programmers in the company s information services department write specialized conversion programs that permit this data to be reformatted into standardized and proprietary formats using ibm es mainframe and ibm as midrange computers and windows nt and os warp connect servers 
statistical reports are then prepared to verify the completeness and accuracy of the data 
generally  it is not necessary to rewrite conversion programs for clients for each successive audit 
this reformatted data is compressed onto cd rom media and delivered to the company s auditors who  using the company s proprietary field audit software  sort  filter and search the data for overpayments 
standard reports and client specific statistical data also are produced for auditors 
pc based software modules the company has developed pc based proprietary software modules for use primarily in the field by its auditors 
these software modules include the following auditpro is used in non edi systems to facilitate auditor defined searches of reformatted client accounts payable records for patterns indicative of potential overpayments 
in addition to using the standard analytical reports produced by auditpro  auditors may design sophisticated custom inquiries to sort  filter and print client records 
edi inquiry is a comprehensive module used to sort  filter and print purchasing  receiving and payment records at the line item level for clients operating in an edi environment 
by utilizing line item detail  this module facilitates the search of a significantly greater number of transaction records and improves auditor productivity 
claims management system enables the auditor to compile  print and report on claims information by individual audit 
this module also is used to summarize audit findings for management reports that are typically provided to clients at the conclusion of each engagement 
freightpro is used to audit and produce claims from electronic freight records 
client freight billing data is compared with vendor routing guide instructions to isolate potential overcharges 
reportpro is a specialized report generator designed to create and display customized reports in conjunction with the company s other proprietary software modules from a hard drive or cd rom 
proprietary databases the company has developed and continuously updates and refines its proprietary databases that serve as a central repository reflecting its auditors experiences  vendor practices and knowledge of regional and national pricing information  including seasonal allowances  discounts and rebates 
these proprietary databases do not include confidential client information 
auditors use these databases to identify discounts  allowances and other pricing information not previously detected 
auditor hiring and training many of the company s auditors formerly held finance related management positions in the retailing industry 
these experienced auditors provide important insights into certain aspects of the retailing industry 
the company also has relied on its auditors to assist in creating its auditor training programs and techniques and in developing its proprietary audit software 
to meet its growing need for additional auditors  the company has begun hiring recent college graduates  particularly those with multi lingual capabilities 
while the company has been able to hire a sufficient number of new auditors to support its growth  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue hiring sufficient numbers of qualified auditors to meet its future needs 
the company s training program for auditors consists of intensive training classes employing specialized computer based training modules  and on the job training 
the in house training program is continuously upgraded based on feedback from auditors and on changing industry protocols 
additional on the job training by experienced auditors enhances classroom education and enables newly hired auditors to refine their skills 
because auditor compensation is based on team performance rather than individual results  the company believes senior auditors are motivated to continue training new auditors to maximize client recoveries and audit team compensation 
as the company hires new auditors  there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue providing the same in depth training or have sufficient numbers of experienced auditors to continue its on the job training program 
client base the company provides its services principally to large transaction intensive businesses that include retailers  such as discount  department  specialty  grocery and drug stores  wholesale distributors  manufacturers and distributors of high technology products and certain governmental agencies and healthcare providers 
based on retail sales  of the top retailers worldwide  each having sales in excess of billion  were clients of the company in although the company targets clients principally with million or more in annual revenues  smaller businesses may be suitable clients if they are sufficiently transaction intensive and offer significant growth prospects 
for the year ended december   the company derived of its revenues from wal mart stores  inc and its affiliates wal mart  and of its revenues from its five largest clients including wal mart  as compared to and  respectively  for and and  respectively  for the company anticipates that its reliance on any individual client or its five largest clients will decrease over time as its client base increases 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the company s client base will increase or that the company s largest clients will continue to utilize the company s services on the same level and  should one or more of such large clients file for bankruptcy or otherwise cease to do business with the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
seasonality the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonality in its business 
the company typically realizes higher revenues and operating income in the last two quarters of its fiscal year  with its highest revenues and operating income typically realized in the third quarter 
this trend is expected to continue and reflects the inherent purchasing and operational cycles of the retailing industry  which is the principal industry served by the company 
should this trend not continue  the company s profitability for any affected quarter and the entire year could be materially and adversely impacted due to ongoing selling  general and administrative expenses that are largely fixed over the short term 
sales and marketing the company markets its services primarily through one on one meetings with executives of targeted clients 
the decision to engage a recovery audit firm is similar to the decision to engage most professional service firms and usually involves a lengthy period of familiarization  investigation and evaluation by the prospective client 
the sales cycle often exceeds one year in both domestic and international markets 
in the us and canada  where the use of recovery audit services is a generally accepted business practice among retailers  the company generally must displace a competing firm in order to expand market share 
internationally  recovery audit is a relatively new business service that requires an initial educational process in order to gain acceptance 
at december   the company s domestic marketing staff consisted of persons headed by a senior officer 
the company plans to expand its marketing staff in the us and internationally as its business grows and it enters new markets 
proprietary rights the company continuously develops new recovery audit software and enhances existing proprietary software 
the company regards its proprietary software as protected by trade secret and copyright laws of general applicability 
in addition  the company attempts to safeguard its software through employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods of protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy  obtain or reverse engineer certain portions of the company s software or otherwise to obtain or use other information the company regards as proprietary 
while the company s competitive position may be affected by its ability to protect its software and other proprietary information  the company believes that the protection afforded by trade secret and copyright laws is less significant to the company s success than the continued pursuit and implementation of its operating strategies and other factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of its personnel 
the company has filed an application to register its copyrights for auditpro  edi inquiry  claims management system  freightpro and recovernow with the us copyright office 
third parties with functionally similar software could assert claims under the copyright act of  as amended  the federal patent law or state trade secret laws that the company s proprietary recovery audit software application products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of such entities 
these third parties may seek damages from the company as a result of such alleged infringement  demand that the company license certain proprietary rights from them or otherwise demand that the company cease and desist from its use or license the allegedly infringing software 
such action may result in protracted and costly litigation or royalty arrangements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
although the company believes that its recovery audit software does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and the company knows of no such pending or other extended claims of infringement  there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted against the company in the future 
the company s trademarks include profit recovery group international  prg  auditpro  edi inquiry  claims management system  freightpro  reportpro and recovernow 
the company has registered profit recovery group international and auditpro as federal trademarks and applications to register recovernow and the company s logo are pending with the us patent and trademark office 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in its attempt to register such trademarks or that it otherwise will be able to continue to use any of the foregoing trademarks 
the company has filed applications for protection of certain of its trademarks outside of the us in the various countries where the company conducts business and such protection is available 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in its attempt to register or continue to use such trademarks outside of the us competition the recovery audit business is highly competitive 
the competitive factors affecting the market for the company s recovery audit services include establishing and maintaining client relationships  quality and quantity of claims identified  experience and professionalism of audit staff  rates for services  technology and geographic scope of operations 
the company s principal competitors for recovery audit services include local and regional firms and one firm  howard schultz associates  with a network of affiliate organizations in the us and abroad 
the company believes that howard schultz associates has been in operation longer than the company and may have achieved greater revenues than the company in there can be no assurance that the company will continue competing successfully with such firms 
the company believes that as large  transaction intensive businesses expand internationally and implement edi accounts payable systems  smaller recovery audit firms will lack the technology and infrastructure necessary to remain competitive unless they make substantial investments to upgrade and expand their skills  technologies and geographic scope of operations 
employees at december   the company had employees 
of these  persons were located in the us  with persons in the audit function  persons in sales and marketing  persons in information services and the remainder in corporate  finance and administrative functions 
in addition to its employees located outside the us  internationally the company engaged independent contractors at december  the company believes employee relations are good 
item properties the company s principal executive office is located in approximately  square feet of office space in atlanta  georgia 
the company subleases this space through december  and has an option to renew the lease for five years contingent upon the prime lease being renewed 
the company leases  square feet of office and warehouse space in bentonville  arkansas 
this lease has an initial five year term that commenced on april   with an option to renew for an additional five year period 
in addition  the company maintains other offices in close proximity to certain of its larger clients 
the leases for these offices vary in term and range from  to  square feet 
the company anticipates that additional space will be required as business expands and believes that it will be able to obtain suitable space as needed

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading provider of accounts payable and other recovery audit services to large retailers and other transaction intensive companies 
in businesses with large purchase volumes and continuously fluctuating prices  some small percentage of erroneous overpayments to vendors is inevitable  resulting in lost profits 
the company identifies and documents these overpayments by using sophisticated proprietary technology and advanced audit techniques and methodologies  and by employing highly trained  experienced recovery audit specialists 
the company receives a contractually negotiated percentage of amounts recovered 
the earliest of the company s predecessors were formed in november  and in early acquired the operating assets of roy greene associates  inc and bottom line associates  inc  which were formed in and  respectively 
in january  the company purchased certain assets of fial associates  inc  a us competitor  which had revenues of million 
in the year ended december   former fial associates accounts represented revenues of million 
in january  the company acquired the net operating assets of shaps group  inc  a california based company providing recovery audit services to manufacturers  and distributors of high technology products 
in february  the company acquired all of the common stock of accounts payable recovery services  inc  a texas based company providing recovery audit services to healthcare entities and energy companies 
the company intends to continue pursuing domestic and international strategic acquisitions  including direct competitors and complementary businesses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at present  the company s revenues primarily are derived from large retail clients  such as discount  department  specialty  grocery and drug stores  as well as wholesale distributors 
the company also serves certain governmental agencies and healthcare providers 
revenues are recognized at the time overpayment claims are submitted to and approved by clients  as adjusted for estimated uncollectible claims 
claims submitted by the company that are not approved by clients for whatever reason are not considered when recognizing revenues 
approved claims are processed by clients and generally taken as credits against outstanding payables or future purchases from the vendors involved 
once credits are taken  the company invoices its clients for a contractually stipulated portion of the recoveries 
the company s contract receivables are largely unbilled because it does not control either the timing of a client s claims processing activities or the timing of a client s payments for purchases from the vendors involved 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although the company records non management auditor compensation expense at the time of related revenue recognition  substantially all compensation payments to these employees are made only from collected revenues 
estimated uncollectible claims are initially established  and subsequently adjusted  for each individual client based on historical collection rates  types of claims identified  current industry conditions  and other factors which  in the opinion of management  deserve recognition 
the company records revenues at estimated net realizable value without reserves 
accordingly  adjustments to uncollectible claim estimates are directly charged or credited to earnings  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that estimates of uncollectible claims will be adequate and  if underestimated  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has achieved significant revenue growth in recent years 
revenues for the years ended december   and increased by  and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the fial associates acquisition  revenues grew 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to achieve these high rates of revenue growth 
the company has successfully maintained high client retention rates with respect to larger accounts payable audit clients whose annual audit claims volumes are of sufficient size to be mutually beneficial 
the company has generally found that it may not be economically viable to provide recovery audit services to clients where annual revenues to the company do not exceed  for the year ended december   the company derived of its revenues from wal mart stores  inc and its affiliates wal mart and of revenues from its five largest clients including wal mart as compared to and  respectively  for and and  respectively  for the company anticipates that its reliance on any individual client or its five largest clients will decrease over time as its client base increases 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the company s client base will increase or that the company s largest clients will continue to utilize the company s services at the same level 
in addition  should one or more of such large clients file for bankruptcy or otherwise cease to do business with the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
