in pursuing these goals  the company has sought alternatives to its recent reliance in and on the domestic market for large diameter pipe  the demand for which has declined significantly from levels experienced in those years 
in an effort to decrease the company s reliance on the domestic large diameter pipe market and provide additional end use for its steel plate  the company acquired a percent interest in the camrose pipe mill in june from stelco  a large canadian steel producer  which owns the remaining percent interest in the camrose pipe mill 
the camrose pipe mill has two pipe manufacturing mills 
one is a large diameter pipe mill similar to that of the napa pipe mill and the other is an erw pipe mill which produces steel pipe used in the oil and gas industry for drilling and distribution 
the combined capacity of the two mills is approximately  tons per year depending on product mix 
in  and the camrose pipe mill shipped   tons  and  respectively  of steel pipe and generated revenues of million  million  and million  respectively 
during those years stelco was a major supplier of steel plate and coil for the camrose pipe mill 
under the acquisition agreement for the mill  either the company or stelco may initiate a buy sell procedure pursuant to which the initiating party establishes a price for the camrose pipe mill and the other party must either sell its interest to the initiating party at that price or purchase the initiating party s interest at that price  at any time after march  to expand the company s steel product lines and enter new geographic areas  cf i purchased the pueblo mill and related assets in march the pueblo mill has melting and finishing capacity of approximately million tons per year 
in  and the pueblo mill shipped   and  tons  respectively  and generated revenues of million  million  and million  respectively

additionally  depreciation expense associated with the combination mill and interest costs previously capitalized as a cost of construction are expected to be expensed during the second half of the company expects that these costs will adversely affect financial results until the combination mill is fully operational 
in an effort to minimize adverse financial results and disruptions of plate products to its external and internal plate customers  it is the company s intention to continue to operate its current plate rolling facility at the portland mill until the middle of when the combination mill begins to roll plate in excess of
