the increase in same store sales was the result of an increase in check averages partially offset by a decline in customer counts 
the increase in check averages was primarily the result of new menu items introduced over the past year and increased check averages associated with the company s repositioned italian grill units 
additionally  modest menu price adjustments made during the last months also contributed to the increase in check averages 
fiscal sales in the company s eight italian grill units  during current year periods while operating under the italian grill format  increased over comparable periods in fiscal  while sales in the company s traditional spaghetti warehouse concept declined in fiscal due to these favorable sales results  the company plans to convert six to eight units to the italian grill format in fiscal costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was due to higher food costs associated with the italian grill and higher commodity prices incurred on certain meat  dairy and pasta products 
due to the higher food costs associated with the italian grill  management anticipates that cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues will increase modestly in fiscal as more units are converted to the italian grill format 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal much of this decrease is due to the closure of the seven low volume units in february these units generally incurred higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues than typical company restaurants 
improved controls over restaurant labor and reduced marketing expenditures also contributed to the current year decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in group medical costs in comparison to prior year 
management anticipates that operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues will be comparable with current year levels during fiscal general and administrative expenses g a g a expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in both fiscal and the fixed nature of certain g a costs  relative to the decline in total revenues  put upward pressure on g a as a percentage of total revenues  however  reductions in recruitment expenses and legal fees  coupled with the fiscal write off of costs incurred in the preparation of the addison property for its conversion to cappellini s  caused g a as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat in fiscal depreciation and amortization d a d a as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to elimination of depreciation expense on the seven low volume units closed in february restructuring charges reversals in the third quarter of fiscal  the company implemented a restructuring plan intended to strengthen its competitive position and improve cash flow and profitability 
in conjunction with the plan  the company closed seven under performing restaurants in february and identified one additional restaurant to be sold as an operating unit 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal to cover costs related to the execution of this plan  including the write down of property and equipment to its estimated net realizable value  severance packages and various other store closing and corporate obligations 
as a result of obtaining more favorable disposal terms on the seven restaurant properties closed in the restructuring plan  total costs relating to this plan were less than the previously recorded charge 
therefore  the company reversed  in pre tax restructuring charges in fiscal due to the recent disposal of all remaining identified corporate assets  the company completed its original restructuring plan  thus resulting in a balance of accrued restructuring charges at june  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of long lived assets the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no

income taxes the company s effective income tax rate decreased from a benefit in fiscal to a provision in fiscal the decline is primarily attributable to the fact that a higher proportion of the company s consolidated pre tax earnings was generated by the company s canadian operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal these canadian earnings are taxed at a lower rate thereby reducing the company s overall tax rate 
the reduction in fiscal us pre tax earnings as a percentage of consolidated pre tax earnings was attributable to the million in asset impairment charges recorded in the current year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
compared to revenues fiscal revenues declined million  or  in comparison to fiscal this decrease was attributable to a reduction in sales resulting from the closure of seven under performing restaurants in february  a decline in fiscal same store sales and reduced sales resulting from the temporary closure of the marietta and addison restaurants for their conversion to other concepts 
the decline in fiscal same store sales was the result of an decrease in customer counts offset by a increase in check averages 
same store customer count comparisons were negatively affected by the continued growth of competitors in the casual dining and italian restaurant segments and by periods of unusually severe winter weather in the third quarter 
the increase in check averages was primarily the result of new menu items introduced over the last months  higher check averages at italian grill units and modest menu price adjustments made during the last months 
costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was the result of improved inventory controls and modest price adjustments made during fiscal and fiscal operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is primarily attributed to a significant increase in marketing expenditures over fiscal additionally  increases in management labor  kitchen labor and property taxes as a percentage of revenues contributed to the overall increase 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in dining room labor  group medical costs and general liability insurance costs as a percentage of revenues 
the fixed nature of certain costs  relative to the decline in same store sales  also contributed to the increase in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative expenses g a g a expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the fixed nature of certain g a expenses  relative to the fiscal decrease in total revenues  contributed to the increase in g a as a percentage of total revenues

depreciation and amortization d a d a as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was due to the fixed nature of depreciation relative to the decline in fiscal same store sales and to an increase in depreciation incurred on new point of sale pos equipment 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in pre opening amortization on new stores resulting from a reduction in the company s new unit expansion rate 
restructuring charges reversals on january   the company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan intended to strengthen the company s competitive position and improve cash flow and profitability 
in conjunction with the plan  the company closed seven under performing restaurants in february and identified one additional restaurant to be sold as an operating unit 
the seven closed stores include those previously located in hartford  connecticut  providence  rhode island  buffalo  new york  rochester  new york  columbia  south carolina  greenville  south carolina and little rock  arkansas 
additionally  the company has executed a contract to sell its richmond  virginia restaurant to its virginia franchisee during the second quarter of fiscal the company recorded a million pre tax charge in the third quarter of fiscal to cover costs associated with the implementation of this plan  including the write down of property and equipment to its net realizable value  severance packages and various other store closing and corporate obligations 
gain on asset scheduled for divestiture in fiscal  the company purchased its existing austin  texas location and ceased development of an alternate austin location 
the company sold the alternate austin location in fiscal for an amount exceeding its recorded book value  thus recognizing a  gain at the time of its sale 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributed to decreases in the average debt outstanding under the company s credit facilities 
additionally  interest earned on cash proceeds from the disposal of closed restaurants helped reduce fiscal net interest expense 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate increased from a provision in fiscal to a benefit in fiscal the fiscal rate was below statutory rates due primarily to the utilization of the federal fica tax tip credit 
the increase from fiscal was primarily the result of the tax benefit relating to fiscal restructuring charges that were deferred for income tax purposes for future years 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital deficit decreased from million on june  to million on june  this decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of accrued restructuring charges in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the company is currently operating with a working capital deficit  which is common in the restaurant industry since restaurant companies do not normally require significant investment in either accounts receivable or inventory 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was attributed to the increase in current year earnings  the receipt of prior year income tax refunds and changes in certain components of working capital 
long term debt outstanding on june  consisted of a million term loan borrowed under the company s existing bank credit facility 
the company has an additional million available under its bank revolving credit facility as of june   subject to meeting a certain funded debt to cash flow requirement prior to borrowing any additional funds 
in fiscal  the company s board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock for investment purposes 
as of june   the company had repurchased  shares of common stock under this program  including  shares in fiscal further purchases with respect to this program are dependent upon various business and financial considerations 
the company s capital expenditures decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal expenditures consist primarily of the conversion of five company restaurants to the italian grill format and normal purchases of new and replacement restaurant equipment and decor 
during fiscal  the company converted five of its traditional spaghetti warehouse restaurants to the italian grill format 
one additional unit has also been converted to the italian grill format during the first quarter of fiscal the italian grill concept is an updated version of the traditional spaghetti warehouse concept and features new decor  an expanded menu and even greater customer value 
based on favorable sales and operating results achieved in previously converted units  the company plans to convert six to eight existing units to the italian grill format during fiscal in addition to italian grill conversions  the company plans to open two to three new units and to continue to make necessary replacements and upgrades to its existing restaurants and information systems during fiscal total planned capital expenditures relating to fiscal projects are million 
cash flow from operations  current cash balances and amounts available under the company s bank revolving credit facility are expected to be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  payment of required term loan maturities and possible further repurchases of company stock in fiscal effect of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a significant effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
the company has historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  however  due to the competitive environment of the restaurant industry  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass on such cost increases in the future 
seasonality the company s business is subject to seasonality  with revenues generally being highest during the months of july and august and lowest during the months of september through january 
this seasonality is due to the dining out patterns of the company s customers
