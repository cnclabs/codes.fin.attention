the agreement terminates in august at december   the fair value of this swap  as determined by bt co was approximately  and was recorded as interest expense at december  in connection with the re acquisition of the portilla and happy fields  the company assumed a commodity price hedge on variable volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
monthly settlements with amounts either due to or from christiania are based on the differential between a fixed and a variable price for crude oil and natural gas 
during  the approximate monthly volume of crude oil sales subject to this agreement is  barrels at a fixed price of 
this agreement reduces to approximately  barrels per month in   barrels per month in   barrels per month in and  barrels per month in until november the fixed price paid to the company over this five year period averages per barrel

financing provided million during for the year ended december   operating activities provided million of cash 
investing activities required million primarily for the development of existing properties 
total cash provided from financing activities for was million as the result of the sale of  shares of common stock and contingent value rights during november which resulted in net proceeds of million 
during  operating activities provided million of cash 
investing activities during utilized million of cash primarily for the acquisition of the orri and the west texas properties for million and the development of producing properties of million 
the company borrowed million during  repaid million of long term debt  sold common stock for proceeds of million and paid financing fees and dividends on preferred stock resulting in a net contribution of million from financing activities 
the company is heavily dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices which have historically been volatile 
although the company has hedged a portion of its natural gas production and intends to continue this practice  future crude oil and natural gas price declines would have a negative impact on the company s overall results  and therefore  its liquidity 
furthermore  low crude oil and natural gas prices could affect the company s ability to raise capital on terms favorable to the company 
at december   the company had  subject to the limitations discussed below  million of net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes  of which approximately million are available for utilization without limitation 
these loss carryforwards will expire from through if not utilized 
at december   the company had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for canadian tax purposes which expire in as a result of the acquisition of certain partnership interests and crude oil and natural gas properties in and  an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended section  occurred in december accordingly  it is expected that the use of net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to december  of million will be limited to approximately  per year 
as a result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock for acquisitions and sales of stock  an additional ownership change under section occurred in october accordingly  it is expected that the use of all us net operating loss carryforwards generated through october or million will be limited to approximately million per year subject to the lower limitations described above 
of the million net operating loss carryforwards  it is anticipated that the maximum net operating loss that may be utilized before it expires is million 
future changes in ownership may further limit the use of the company s carryforwards 
in addition to the section limitations  uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  the company has established a valuation allowance of million and million for deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
based upon the current level of operations  the company believes that cash flow from operations and the company s credit facility with the banks  will be adequate to meet its anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled interest payments through a depressed price for natural gas or crude oil will have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flow from operations and anticipated levels of working capital  and could force the company to revise its planned capital expenditures
