the results of operations of the municipal water group have been reported as income from discontinued operations 
impairment of long lived assets during fiscal the company recorded a  impairment of long lived asset loss 
the impairment charge mainly pertains to the company s italian subsidiaries and was the result of the potential non deductibility of goodwill amortization coupled with decreasing margins and operating profits

the two most significant initiatives are the consolidation and downsizing of pibiviesse spa pbvs and the relocation of jameco industries  inc jameco
