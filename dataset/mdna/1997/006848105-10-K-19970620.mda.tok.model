liquidity and capital resources the cable television business is capital intensive and typically requires continual financing for the construction  modernization  maintenance  expansion and acquisition of cable systems 
during the three fiscal years in the period ended march   the company committed substantial capital resources for these purposes and for investments in olympus  clec joint ventures and other affiliates and entities 
these expenditures were funded through long term borrowings and internally generated funds 
the company s aggregate outstanding borrowings as of march  were  the company s ability to generate cash to meet its future needs will depend generally on its results of operations and the continued availability of external financing 
capital expenditures 
the company has developed an innovative fiber to feeder network architecture which is designed to increase channel capacity and minimize future capital expenditures  while positioning the company to take advantage of future opportunities 
management believes its capital expenditures program has resulted in higher levels of channel capacity and addressability in comparison to other cable television operators 
in most of its recent upgrades  the company has utilized a modified passive network architecture mpna which utilizes fiber optic cable as an alternative to the coaxial cable that historically has been used to distribute cable signals to the subscriber s home 
the mpna design deploys on average one fiber node for every two miles of fiber optic cable or approximately one fiber node for every homes passed 
the company believes this compares favorably with current industry averages 
this deep penetration of fiber optic cable into the systems networks has the advantages of providing increased reliability to customers  improved bandwidth  and easier implementation of the return path plant capabilities 
this will position the company to offer additional video programming services  to utilize the expanded bandwidth potential of digital compression technology and to meet the anticipated transmission requirements for high definition television  digital television  high speed data and telephone services

regulatory and competitive matters the cable television operations of the company may be adversely affected by changes and developments in governmental regulation  competitive forces and technology 
the cable television industry and the company are subject to extensive regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
the cable act significantly expanded the scope of regulation of certain subscriber rates and a number of other matters in the cable industry  such as mandatory carriage of local broadcast stations and retransmission consent  and increased the administrative costs of complying with such regulations 
the fcc has adopted rate regulations that establish  on a system by system basis  maximum allowable rates for i basic and cable programming services other than programming offered on a per channel or per program basis  based upon a benchmark methodology  and ii associated equipment and installation services based upon cost plus a reasonable profit 
under the fcc rules  franchising authorities are authorized to regulate rates for basic services and associated equipment and installation services  and the fcc will regulate rates for regulated cable programming services in response to complaints filed with the agency 
the telecommunications act of the act ends fcc regulation of cable programming service tier rates on march  rates for basic and cable programming services are set pursuant to a benchmark formula 
alternatively  a cable operator may elect to use a cost of service methodology to show that rates for basic and cable programming services are reasonable 
refunds with interest will be required to be paid by cable operators who are required to reduce regulated rates 
the fcc has reserved the right to reduce or increase the benchmarks it has established 
the rate regulations also limit increases in regulated rates to an inflation indexed amount plus increases in certain costs such as taxes  franchise fees  costs associated with specific franchise requirements and increased programming costs 
cost based adjustments to these capped rates can also be made in the event a cable operator adds or deletes channels or completes a significant system rebuild or upgrade 
on november   the fcc adopted an alternative method for adjusting the rates charged for a cable programming services tier when new services are added 
this has allowed cable operators to increase rates by as much as plus programming costs  over a three year period ending december  to reflect the addition of up to seven new channels of service on cable programming service tiers 
in addition  a new programming tier can be created  the rate for which would not be regulated as long as certain conditions are met  such as not moving services from existing tiers to the new one 
because of the limitation on rate increases for regulated services  future revenue growth from cable services will rely to a much greater extent than has been true in the past on increased revenues from unregulated services and new subscribers than from increases in previously unregulated rates 
the fcc has adopted regulations implementing all of the requirements of the cable act 
the fcc is also likely to continue to modify  clarify or refine the rate regulations 
adelphia cannot predict the effect of the act on future rulemaking proceedings or changes to the rate regulations 
effective september   as a result of the cable act  adelphia repackaged certain existing cable services by adjusting rates for basic service and introducing a new method of offering certain cable services 
adelphia adjusted the basic service rates and related equipment and installation rates in all of its systems in order for such rates to be in compliance with the applicable benchmark or equipment and installation cost levels 
adelphia also implemented a program in all of its systems called cableselect under which most of adelphia s satellite delivered programming services were offered individually on a per channel basis  or as a group at a price of approximately to below the sum of the per channel prices of all such services 
for subscribers who elected to customize their channel lineup  adelphia provided  for a monthly rental fee  an electronic device located on the cable line outside the home  enabling a subscriber s television to receive only those channels selected by the subscriber 
these basic service rate adjustments and the cableselect program were also implemented in all systems managed by adelphia 
adelphia believes cableselect provided increased programming choices to its subscribers while providing flexibility to adelphia to respond to future changes in areas such as customer demand and programming 
adelphia no longer offers the cableselect program in any of its systems 
a letter of inquiry was received by an olympus system regarding the implementation of this new method of offering services 
olympus responded in writing to the fcc s inquiry 
on november   the cable services bureau of the fcc issued a decision holding that the cableselect program was an evasion of the rate regulations and ordered this package to be treated as a regulated tier 
this decision  and all other letters of inquiry decisions  were principally decided on the number of programming services moved from regulated tiers to a la carte packages 
adelphia appealed this decision to the full commission which affirmed the cable service bureau s decision 
adelphia has sought reconsideration of the decision 
on november   the fcc released amended rules under which  on a prospective basis  any a la carte package will be treated as a regulated tier  except for packages involving premium services 
an appeal of this decision to the us court of appeals for the dc circuit was unsuccessful 
on may   the fcc adopted an order approving a settlement agreement between adelphia and the fcc that resolves pending rate proceedings in communities served by adelphia in which a la carte packages were created 
under the terms of the agreement  adelphia is required to make refunds totaling approximately  including interest through december   plus additional interest from january  through the date of payment 
adelphia also will be required to reduce its rates in certain communities 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  included a  charge representing management s estimate of the total costs associated with the resolution of this matter 
such costs included  i an estimate of credits to be extended to customers in future periods of up to  ii legal and other costs incurred during the fiscal year ended march   and iii an estimate of legal and other costs to be incurred associated with the ultimate resolution of this matter 
at march    of the charge to earnings remained in accrued interest and other liabilities which management believes is adequate to cover the settlement and related costs 
while adelphia cannot predict the ultimate outcome or effect of this matter  management of adelphia does not expect the ultimate outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on adelphia s financial position and results of operations 
also  no assurance can be given as to what other future actions congress  the fcc or other regulatory authorities may take or the effects thereof on the company 
the company is currently unable to predict the effect that the amended regulations  future fcc treatment of a la carte packages or other future fcc rulemaking proceedings will have on its business and results of operations in future periods 
cable television companies operate under franchises granted by local authorities which are subject to renewal and renegotiation from time to time 
because such franchises are generally non exclusive  there is a potential for competition with the systems from other operators of cable television systems  including public systems operated by municipal franchising authorities themselves  and from other distribution systems capable of delivering television programming to homes 
the cable act and the act contain provisions which encourage competition from such other sources 
the company cannot predict the extent to which competition will materialize from other cable television operators  local telephone companies  other distribution systems for delivering television programming to the home  or other potential competitors  or  if such competition materializes  the extent of its effect on the company 
fcc rules heretofore permitted local telephone companies to offer video dialtone service for video programmers  including channel capacity for the carriage of video programming and certain non common carrier activities such as video processing  billing and collection and joint marketing agreements 
new jersey bell telephone company received authorization on july  to operate a video dialtone service in portions of dover county  new jersey  in which the company serves approximately  subscribers 
the act repealed the prohibition on lecs from providing video programming directly to customers within their local exchange areas other than in rural areas or by specific waiver of fcc rules 
the act also authorized lecs to operate open video systems ovs without obtaining a local cable franchise  although lecs operating such a system can be required to make payments to local governmental bodies in lieu of cable franchise fees 
where demand exceeds capacity  up to two thirds of the channels on an ovs must be available to programmers unaffiliated with the lec 
the statute states that the ovs scheme supplants the fcc s video dialtone rules 
the fcc has promulgated rules to implement the ovs concept  and new jersey bell has been granted permission to convert its video dialtone authorization to an ovs authorization 
the company believes that the provision of video programming by telephone companies in competition with the company s existing operations could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
at this time  the impact of any such effect is not known or estimable 
dbs service became available to consumers during a single dbs satellite can provide more than channels of programming 
dbs service can be received virtually anywhere in the united states through the installation of a small outdoor antenna 
dbs service is being heavily marketed on a nationwide basis by several service providers 
the extent to which dbs will be competitive with cable systems will depend on the continued availability of reception equipment and programming at reasonable prices to the consumer
