item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which napro s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of napro s results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
see business special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
general napro has devoted its efforts primarily to the development and implementation of its eip tm technology for producing nbt paclitaxel 
napro is currently dependent exclusively on sales of nbt paclitaxel for revenue 
through december   napro s production of nbt paclitaxel was limited primarily to research and pilot scale production  and much of napro s product sales were for use in clinical trials and for research and development purposes 
accordingly  napro has generated only limited revenue from such activities and has incurred significant operating losses  including operating losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  napro expects that it will continue to have a high level of operating expense and will be required to make significant up front expenditures in connection with its biomass procurement  product development and research and development activities 
napro anticipates that operating losses will continue until such time  if ever  as napro is able to generate sufficient revenue to support its operations 
napro believes that its ability to generate such revenue depends primarily on the ability of its strategic partners to obtain regulatory approval in the us for the commercial sale of nbt paclitaxel  on napro s ability to obtain regulatory approval for its manufacturing facilities and on napro s ability to construct manufacturing facilities that produce quantities of nbt paclitaxel sufficient to supply the strategic partners requirements for commercial sales 
moreover  napro s future growth and profitability will depend on the success of the strategic partners in fostering acceptance in the oncological market for nbt paclitaxel as a preferred form of chemotherapy to be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents 
in january  faulding received approval to market nbt paclitaxel commercially in australia under their trade name anzatax tm 
although napro s revenue has increased as a result of this approval  napro does not currently expect to reach profitability for the year ending december  the ability of faulding to continue to market nbt paclitaxel in australia pursuant to faulding s marketing approval and the success of these marketing efforts will continue to have a significant effect on napro s revenue and profitability 
in june napro completed the call of  redeemable warrants  issuing  shares of common stock with the receipt of cash in the amount of million pursuant to cash exercise elections of  redeemable warrants  and issuing  shares of common stock pursuant to cash less exercise elections of  redeemable warrants 
in august  napro closed a public offering of million shares of its common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of million to the company 
the proceeds of this offering are being used to establish and upgrade manufacturing facilities and to fund napro s operations  capital expenditures  additional plantation development and general corporate purposes 
results of operations napro was in the development stage through december  comparison of operations between years and historical trends does not necessarily indicate future trends and operating results of napro 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased  to million for from million for through december   the majority of product sales had been for use in clinical trials and for research and development purposes 
such sales are unpredictable by nature 
although initial commercial sales commenced in january  and increased in  napro expects these sales to be unpredictable until such time as the markets of the strategic partners have been established and proven 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research  development and cost of products sold increased million to million for from million for the increase was due primarily to an increase in the level of process development and research  including higher production cost due to higher production volume 
napro s production process is not distinct from its research and development processes 
accordingly  the cost of products sold is included with napro s research and development expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense g a increased million to million for from million for this increase was due primarily to an increase in facility cost and an increase in administrative and support staff 
plantation fees 
plantation fees decreased from  in to zero  reflecting the completion of research related to plantation development as of december  in  napro began capitalizing plantation expenditures incurred prior to the first commercial harvest and depletes such cost over the remaining life of the plantation contract using the units of production method 
interest income 
interest income increased  to  for from  for this increase was the result of larger free cash balances associated with the completion of napro s offering of common stock in august and its warrant call completed in june see liquidity and capital resources 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased  to  for from  for the increase was attributable to interest on increased borrowings on the equipment lease line and note payable to faulding see liquidity and capital resources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million to million for from million for the increase was attributable primarily to the timing of product deliveries to the strategic partners  as well as changes in pricing associated with commercial sales of nbt paclitaxel in australia 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research  development and cost of products sold increased million to million for from million for the increase was due primarily to an increase in the level of process development and research  including higher production cost due to higher production volume 
general and administrative expense 
g a increased  to million for from million for the increase was due primarily to an increase in administrative and related support staff 
faulding royalty expense and plantation fees 
plantation fees decreased  to  for from million for higher fees during reflected the additional expense of establishing the plantation as opposed to ongoing maintenance in see note to the financial statements 
the million faulding royalty expense was a one time charge 
interest income 
interest income increased  to  for from  for this increase was the result of larger free cash balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased  to  for from  for the decrease was the result of the absence of interest on bridge loans which were paid off in liquidity and capital resources napro s capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   napro had a working capital balance of million 
this compared to a working capital balance of million as of december  to date  the funding of napro s capital requirements has been dependent primarily on net proceeds of public offerings of its common stock of approximately million  on private placements of its equity securities of approximately million  on the exercise of warrants and options of million  and on capital leases  loans and advances from its stockholders and the strategic partners 
working capital and cash flow cash and cash equivalents increased million to million for the year ended december  from million at december  net cash provided by financing activity was partially offset by million used in operating activities  by capital expenditures of million and net purchases of investments of million 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from  at december  net cash provided by financing activity was partially offset by cash used in operations of million  by capital expenditures of million and net purchases of investments of  inventory increased million to million in the year ended december  from million at december  the amount of product held as finished goods equivalents in work in progress inventories as well as finished goods inventories is dependent on a number of factors  including the shipping requirements of the strategic partners and napro s production planning for meeting those needs 
inventory balances may vary significantly during product development and launch periods 
napro may make significant biomass investments during capital expenditures napro expended million and million  respectively  during and for capital projects 
these expenditures primarily included plantation cost  initial work on a new large scale commercial eip tm manufacturing facility in boulder  and expansion and improvement to napro s boulder laboratories and facilities 
in  napro expects to invest capital in property  plant and equipment  primarily to expand its plantation operations  to complete the large scale commercial eip tm manufacturing facility in boulder and to upgrade and expand its extraction manufacturing capabilities 
napro anticipates a significant increase in capital expenditures and operations in in anticipation of possible nda approval 
therefore  napro plans to obtain additional capital during the year 
if napro is not successful in attracting capital  it will need to significantly reduce the scope of capital expenditures and operations 
the amount and timing of future capital expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of napro s research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and marketing developments  changes in or terminations of existing strategic partnerships  the establishment of additional strategic relationships and the cost of manufacturing scale up 
napro may seek additional long term financing to fund capital expenditures should such financing become available on terms acceptable to napro 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   napro had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards is limited after an ownership change  as defined in such section  to an annual amount equal to the value of the loss corporation s outstanding stock immediately before the date of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long term tax exempt rate in effect during the month the ownership change occurred 
such an ownership change occurred in september as a result  napro will be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its net operating losses 
this limitation only affects net operating losses incurred up to the ownership change and does not reduce the total amount of net operating loss which may be taken  but rather limits the amount which may be used during a particular year 
therefore  in the event napro achieves profitability  such limitation would have the effect of increasing napro s tax liability and reducing the net income and available cash resources of napro if the taxable income during a year exceeded the allowable loss carried forward to that year
