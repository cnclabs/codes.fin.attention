revenues in fiscal include revenues from the fiscal purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition 
the revenues were generated primarily in the office products and print management industry segments  which represented and  respectively  of consolidated revenues for fiscal  and and  respectively  of consolidated revenues for fiscal the change in the mix of revenues by industry segment is the direct result of the mix of the acquisitions in the different industry segments completed in fiscal and international revenues increased from million  or of consolidated revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of consolidated revenues in fiscal international revenues consisted primarily of revenues from new zealand and australia  with the balance from canada 
the increase in international revenues was primarily due to the inclusion  in the revenues for fiscal  of revenues from companies that were acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method during fiscal fiscal international revenues include the results of two companies for the entire year and the results of three companies acquired in fiscal in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
gross profit increased  from million  or of revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a shift in revenue mix resulting in a higher proportion of revenues in traditionally higher margin products and services  primarily as a result of products sold in new zealand and australia and as a result of improved purchasing and rebate programs negotiated with vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  in fiscal  to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a shift in revenue mix resulting in a higher proportion of revenues from products and services with traditionally higher selling  general and administrative expenses  such as products sold in new zealand and australia

generally accepted accounting principles gaap require the company to expense all acquisition costs both those paid by the company and those paid by the sellers of the acquired companies related to business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
the increase in such non recurring acquisition costs reflects the increase in the number of business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method  from during fiscal to during fiscal the company expects to incur similar costs in the future  as the company anticipates completing additional acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method

the company also incurred restructuring costs of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
these costs represent the external costs and liabilities to close redundant company facilities  severance costs related to the company s employees and other costs associated with the company s restructuring plans

see business factors affecting the company s future prospects integration of acquisitions and limited combined operating history 
on a regional level  the company is implementing regional consolidation and integration plans for its office supply  office coffee and beverage services and office furniture divisions through which the company has established and expects to continue to establish dfcs 
the dfcs are intended to enable certain operational activities  such as inventory management  purchasing  accounting and human resources  to be shared among hubs and spokes located within the same geographic area 
this regional approach is intended to permit the elimination of duplicative facilities and costs and promote integration of the operations within each region

the company expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately million over the next fiscal year for this and other purposes 
the company anticipates that its current cash on hand  cash flow from operations and additional financing available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for its operations through the remainder of the calendar year 
however  the company is currently  and intends to continue  pursuing additional acquisitions  which are expected to be funded through a combination of cash and common stock 
there can be no assurances that additional sources of financing will not be required during the next twelve months or thereafter to fund the company s acquisition program 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the company s business is subject to seasonal influences 
the company s historical revenues and profitability in its core office products business have been lower in the first two quarters of its fiscal year  primarily due to the lower level of business activity in north america during the summer months 
the seasonality of the core office products business  however  is expected to be impacted by the seasonality of the company s other operations  which have expanded through acquisitions 
for example  the revenues and profitability of the company s school supplies and school furniture business have been higher during the company s first and second quarters and significantly lower in its third and fourth quarters  and the revenues and profitability of the company s operations in new zealand and australia have generally been higher in the company s third quarter 
as the company s mix of businesses evolves through future acquisitions  these seasonal fluctuations may continue to change 
therefore  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that the company may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in the prices paid by the company for the products it sells  the mix of products sold  general economic conditions and the retroactive restatement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the company s consolidated financial statements for acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
moreover  the operating margins of companies acquired by the company may differ substantially from those of the company  which could contribute to the further fluctuation in its quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that the company may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended april  and april  in thousands  except for per share amounts 
the information has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that in the opinion of management reflect all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information 
fiscal first second third fourth total revenues      gross profit      operating income      net income      net income per share

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations during fiscal  or new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board issued a new opinion which establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps 
this opinion is intended to simplify the eps computation and enhance the comparability of eps information internationally 
the new standard requires the presentation of both basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock 
this statement is required to be adopted by the company during the third quarter of fiscal the company anticipates that the adoption of this opinion will not have a material effect on eps
