item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general although the company was organized in april  it was not until march that it began the initial commercial roll out of the model d turbochef cooking system  its first commercial product  and not until june that it entered into the initial whitbread contract  its first major contract  and commenced shipment of its model d turbochef cooking system 
prior to such time  the company was engaged primarily in research and development  limited production operations and test marketing of prototype cooking systems 
as a result  to date  the company has generated limited revenues and incurred substantial operating losses in each year of its operations including net losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  the company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant operating expenses in the future  including in connection with the company s ongoing development activities relating to new product applications for its proprietary foodservice technologies  the training and set up of additional third party manufacturing sources and the continued implementation of the company s marketing plans 
the company s future profitability will thus depend upon  among other things  corresponding increases in revenues from operations to offset these expenditures

the revenues also include  from a customer of the company for licensing of the company s proprietary dough setting process 
cost of sales for the year ended december  was  an increase of  when compared to  for cost of sales in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to greater cooking system unit sales  greater sales of replacement parts  adjustments for inventory made obsolete by the migration from the d to the d model and the establishment of a reserve for future warranty expense 
the increases are partially offset by a reduction in the per unit manufacturing cost in gross profit on sales for the year ended december  increased  to  when compared to gross profit on sales of  during the prior year 
the increase is a result of the greater system unit sales  primarily to whitbread 
gross margin for the year ended december  was of sales  compared to of sales for the year ended december  the percentage increase is attributable to a reduced per unit manufacturing cost which resulted from increased production volume and cost reduction engineering in  offset by the incremental costs associated with the establishment of a warranty reserve and the write off of obsolete d inventory in the effect of the inventory adjustments resulting from the d inventory obsolescence was to decrease gross margin by approximately of sales in research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased  to  from  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the company s ongoing efforts to advance its technologies and product offerings through construction of a residential prototype  the completion of a reduced size commercial system prototype and the development of significant technological improvements to the d commercial model

the increase is a result of the increase in system unit sales  primarily to whitbread 
gross margin for the year ended december  was of sales compared to of sales for the year ended december  the percentage decrease is attributable primarily to the reduced cooking system unit selling price under the whitbread contract for a significant quantity of ovens  as compared to the higher oven unit selling price realized on small quantity purchases in fiscal the margin decrease is partially offset by a reduced per unit manufacturing cost as a result of increase production volume and cost reduction programs implemented during the fourth quarter of prototype and demonstration inventory was comprised primarily of prototype cooking systems  which the company used temporarily as demonstration equipment 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a provision for impairment of such inventory of  and  during the year ended december  the company expensed the remaining inventory value of  research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased  to  from research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to staff reductions  lower prototype parts costs and reduced governmental certification and accreditation fees  reflecting the completion of the development of the turbochef commercial cooking system the company s model d series

pursuant to the acadia agreement  acadia committed to invest up to  in the model e project  over a period of months  for which it was ultimately to receive between a and depending on various circumstances ownership interest in acadiachef  inc acadiachef  the entity formed in connection with this joint venture to commercialize the proposed model e cooking system 
each of the company and acadia had the option  however  of terminating the acadia agreement prior to such time  whereupon acadia s investment would be returned to it pursuant to certain agreed upon terms  as outlined below  and its interest in acadiachef and the e project would be eliminated 
as of march   the company had completed an initial prototype of the model e turbochef cooking system and acadia had invested a total of  in the project pursuant to the terms of the acadia agreement 
the company elected at such time to terminate its arrangement with acadia 
pursuant to the terms of the acadia agreement  upon such termination  acadia had the option of i having its investment returned to it  plus interest accrued thereon at the rate of per annum  in cash and receiving an option to purchase  shares of common stock at per share the market price of the common stock on the date of the acadia agreement  or ii having its investment returned to it  without interest  in the form of common stock  ie converting the principal amount of its investment into  shares of common stock  based on a conversion rate of per share  and receiving an option to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
instead  the company was able to reach an agreement with acadia in june  with an effective date of march   whereby acadia converted its  investment  foregoing the accrued interest thereon  into an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received the acadia option to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
on march   jeffrey b 
bogatin  the chairman of the board and a principal stockholder of the company  exchanged outstanding indebtedness and accrued interest thereon  in the aggregate amount of  for  shares of common stock a conversion rate of per share and  in connection with such exchange  also received an option to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the established conversion and option exercise prices were approximately above the market price of the company s common stock on the date of the transaction 
in june  mr 
bogatin  together with philip r 
mckee  a principal stockholder and the president and chief executive officer of the company  made contributions to the capital of the company in the aggregate amount of  mr 
bogatin exercised options to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  for total proceeds to the company of  and mr 
mckee purchased  shares of restricted common stock from the company at per share  for total proceeds to the company of  during december  mr 
bogatin made an additional  contribution to the capital of the company by exercising options to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  and mr 
mckee advanced to the company the sum of  the note issued to mr 
mckee evidencing such borrowing bore interest at the rate of per annum and was repaid in full an aggregate of  including accrued interest on february  on march   mr 
bogatin and mr 
mckee loaned the company the sums of  and  respectively 
these loans were evidenced by promissory notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum 
each of these notes was payable on demand 
these loans were made to satisfy certain eligibility requirements in order for the company s common stock to continue to be listed on nasdaq 
these notes were repaid in full an aggregate of  including accrued interest prior to the consummation of the june offering 
in june the company consummated the june offering  an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock which resulted in aggregate proceeds of approximately  net of the underwriter s discount and other offering costs of  forward looking statements the company is utilizing the proceeds from the june offering to expand its operations  including  among other things  to continue its product development activities and marketing efforts and to set up additional third party production operations for the manufacture of the company s cooking systems 
the company anticipates  based on its currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its operations including assumptions regarding the progress of its research and development efforts and its ability to reduce cooking system production costs that its current cash and cash equivalent balances and anticipated revenues from operations  will be sufficient to fund its operations and satisfy its contemplated capital requirements for at least the next months 
in the event that the company s plans change  or its assumptions change or prove to be incorrect  or cash balances and anticipated revenues otherwise prove to be insufficient  the company would be required to revise its plan of operations which revision would include a significant reduction in operating costs and or seek additional financing prior to the end of such period 
in march  messrs 
bogatin and mckee made a commitment to provide financial support if and as required to enable the company to meet its obligations through june this commitment was made prior to the june offering  when the company had minimal cash reserves and the timing and likelihood of success of the offering could not be guaranteed 
the company has no other current arrangements with respect to  or sources of  additional financing 
there can thus be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the company  if and when needed  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
although the company intends to use a substantial portion of the proceeds of the june offering to implement the next phase of its business strategy in an effort to expand its current level of operations and grow the company s business  the company s future performance will be subject to a number of business factors  including those beyond the company s control  such as economic downturns and evolving industry needs and preferences  as well as to the level of the company s competition and the ability of the company to successfully market its products and effectively monitor and control its costs 
the company believes that increases in revenues sufficient to offset its expenses and result in its profitability could be derived from its currently proposed plans within the next months  if successfully completed 
these plans include i complete the deliveries of those turbochef cooking systems contemplated by the latest whitbread contract and southland s initial purchase order  ii utilize the awareness created by the whitbread relationship and extend the company s marketing and sales efforts into other countries within the european union  ii further develop the company s relationship with southland and thereby increase product sales to southland  iii obtain initial purchase orders from additional regional or national foodservice operators  iv introduce additional new products  such as its proposed residential cooking system and cub models  v establish a dealer sales network and vi further reduce the company s manufacturing costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement any of the foregoing plans  that either its revenues will increase or its rate of revenue growth will continue or that it will eve be able to achieve profitable operations
