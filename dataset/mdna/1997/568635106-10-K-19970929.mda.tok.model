item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to pages through of the shareholder annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits with short and medium term maturities  mature or reprice at different rates than our interest earning assets 
although having liabilities that mature or reprice less frequently on average than assets will be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  such an asset liability structure will result in lower net income during periods of declining interest rates  unless offset by other factors 
the bank protects against problems arising in a falling interest rate environment by requiring interest rate miniums on its residential and commercial real estate adjustable rate mortgages and against problems arising in a rising interest rate environment by having in excess of of its mortgage loans with adjustable rate features 
management believes that these minimums  which establish floors below which the loan interest rate cannot decline  will continue to reduce its interest rate vulnerability in a declining interest rate environment 
for the loans which do not adjust because of the interest rate minimums  there is an increased risk of prepayment 
the bank believes it is critical to manage the relationship between interest rates and the effect on its net portfolio value npv 
this approach calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities  as well as cash flows from off balance sheet contracts 
the bank manages assets and liabilities within the context of the marketplace  regulatory limitations and within its limits on the amount of change in npv which is acceptable given certain interest rate changes 
the ots issued a regulation  which uses a net market value methodology to measure the interest rate risk exposure of savings associations 
under this ots regulation  an institution s normal level of interest rate risk in the event of an assumed change in interest rates is a decrease in the institution s npv in an amount not exceeding of the present value of its assets 
savings associations with over million in assets or less than a risk based capital ratio are required to file ots schedule cmr 
data from schedule cmr is used by the ots to calculate changes in npv and the related normal level of interest rate risk based upon certain interest rate changes discussed below 
associations which do not meet either of the filing requirements are not required to file ots schedule cmr  but may do so voluntarily 
as the bank does not meet either of these requirements  it is not required to file schedule cmr  although it does so voluntarily 
under the regulation  associations which must file are required to take a deduction the interest rate risk capital component from their total capital available to calculate their risk based capital requirement if their interest rate exposure is greater than normal 
the amount of that deduction is one half of the difference between a the institution s actual calculated exposure to a basis point interest rate increase or decrease whichever results in the greater pro forma decrease in npv and b its normal level of exposure which is of the present value of its assets 
presented below  as of june   is an analysis performed by the ots of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve  in basis point increments  up and down basis points 
at june   of the present value of the bank s assets was approximately million 
because the interest rate risk of a basis point decrease in market rates which was greater than the interest rate risk of a basis point increase was million at june   the bank would not have been required to make a deduction from its total capital available to calculate its risk based capital requirement if it had been subject to the ots s reporting requirements under this methodology

as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain short comings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
most of the bank s adjustable rate loans have interest rate minimums of for residential loans and for commercial real estate loans 
currently  originations of residential adjustable rate mortgages have interest rate minimums of 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase although the bank does underwrite these mortgages at approximately above the origination rate 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk
