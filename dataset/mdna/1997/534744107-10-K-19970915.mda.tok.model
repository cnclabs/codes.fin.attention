item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s net sales are subject to significant seasonal variation 
consequently  results from operations will fluctuate due to these trends 
the company s business is seasonal due to customer buying patterns of poppycock during the traditional holiday season 
as a result  third and fourth calendar quarter sales account for a significant portion of the company s annual sales 
on july   planters began exclusively distributing the company s fiddle faddle and screaming yellow zonkers products pursuant to the distribution agreement for an initial term which was originally scheduled to expire on june  unless renewed for additional one year periods 
the distribution agreement required planters to purchase an annual minimum number of equivalent cases of fiddle faddle and screaming yellow zonkers during the initial term 
on february   lincoln snacks and planters entered into the amendment  pursuant to which the exclusive distribution arrangement with respect to the company s fiddle faddle product was extended for an additional period of six months expiring december  at which time the distribution arrangement will terminate 
effective may   planters ceased  and lincoln snacks resumed  marketing and distributing the company s screaming yellow zonkers product 
the amendment and letter agreement require planters to purchase a specified number of manufactured cases and for planters to compensate the company for the remaining contract minimums for the twelve month period ended june  the amendment requires new minimums for the six month period ended december  six month minimums 
planters purchased of the original june  contract minimums and compensated the company for the remaining 
planters has agreed to compensate the company in the event that planters fails to purchase the six month minimums by december  the amendment also requires planters to compensate the company in the event that certain sales levels are not achieved during the calendar year ending december  in addition  the amendment eliminates planters right to terminate the contract in the event of a change of control  planters right of first refusal on poppycock granted in the distribution agreement  and allows lincoln snacks to enter into co pack arrangements relating to ready to eat popcorn 
although the amendment contains provisions designed to effect a smooth transfer of the distribution business back to the company  there can be no assurance as to the long term effects of the transition

the charge is primarily comprised of a 
million write off of the covenant not to compete  a 
million severance expense relating to a reduction in headcount  and a 
million write off of packaging relating to discontinued items

management continues to focus on increasing product distribution and continues to review all operating costs with the objective of increasing profitability and ensuring future liquidity 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these objectives will be achieved in future periods 
although the amendment contains provisions designed to effect a smooth transfer of the distribution business back to the company  there can be no assurance as to the long term effects of the transition 
the company s short term liquidity is affected by seasonal increases in inventory and accounts receivable levels  payment terms in excess of days granted in some situations during certain months of the year  and seasonality of sales 
inventory and accounts receivable levels increase substantially during the latter part of the third calendar quarter and during the remainder of the calendar year
