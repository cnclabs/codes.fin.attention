funds from operations management generally considers funds from operations ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined as net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the audited consolidated or combined financial statements and information included elsewhere in this report 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and cash distributions 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as an indication of the company s performance or as an alternative to cash flow determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit adopted certain changes to the calculation of ffo during the company has adopted these changes effective january   and the company has restated below its calculation of ffo for comparative purposes 
under nareit s new definition of ffo  the company as well as other reits using the old definition will no longer add back amortization of financing costs 
the following is a calculation of ffo under the new definition in thousands income before extraordinary item 





  gain on disposition of real property 



  depreciation of real estate assets 




  funds from operations 










  ffo increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in ffo was primarily attributable to additional operating income  which resulted from an increase in the number of units owned as a result of property acquisitions and increased operating income from properties owned throughout both periods 
inflation the company leases apartments under lease terms generally ranging from six to months 
management believes that such short term lease contracts lessen the impact of inflation due to the ability to adjust rental rates to market levels as leases expire
