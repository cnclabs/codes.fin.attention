item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company commenced operations in when it licensed one alpha d from the warf 
the company selected one alpha d for development because of its lower toxicity relative to d hormone compounds approved for oral or intravenous administration 
the company was primarily involved in the development of one alpha d for treatment of osteoporosis between april and march the preclinical and clinical studies of one alpha d during this period were largely funded by licensing agreements with each of smithkline beecham pharmaceuticals smithkline beecham and takeda chemical industries  ltd 
takeda 
when the results of a pilot clinical study were released in late  smithkline beecham terminated its licensing agreement with the company due to lower than expected bone mineral density changes in patients taking one alpha d versus placebo 
this termination in part led to the termination by takeda of its license agreement in early the company halted further clinical trials for osteoporosis because the projected aggregate costs associated with funding clinical trials for an osteoporosis indication exceeded million 
over the last several years  the company has begun to focus a considerable amount of its resources on the development of one alpha d as a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with esrd due to lower development costs and the company s belief that the drug would be more effective than existing therapies 
two phase clinical trials with oral one alpha d began in may and were completed in august a multi centered phase clinical trial with intravenous one alpha d commenced in july  which the company estimates will be completed in early marketing approvals  if granted in the united states and europe  would occur in or  at the earliest 
in september  the company began a phase clinical program with oral one alpha d in pre dialysis patients exhibiting secondary hyperparathyroidism 
the expected completion date for these trials is september marketing approval  if granted in the united states  would occur in or  at the earliest 
the company also is conducting a phase phase trial with oral one alpha d in patients exhibiting advanced androgen independent prostate cancer 
this study began in november  and the company estimates its completion in additional phase phase clinical trials are planned in or for oral one alpha d in patients with osteoporosis and with metastatic breast cancer and for a second generation compound  lr  in patients with prostate and or breast cancer 
the success of the company will depend on its ability to develop  license  and market drugs 
the company has not developed any commercial products to date  and there can be no assurance that it will be successful in developing or marketing any commercial products in the future 
its efforts currently are focused primarily on one alpha d the outcome of the company s efforts to develop  market  and license drugs will depend on a number of factors  including the results of clinical trials  the ability to procure regulatory approvals  the success of competing products  regulatory developments including those relating to healthcare reform  third party reimbursement policies  the company s ability to contract for production from third parties  and the extent to which the company is able to develop its own marketing capability or enter into satisfactory marketing arrangements with third parties 
year ended june  versus the company s d hormone related research and development expenses totaled  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal year the increase is due primarily to higher expenditures on one alpha d clinical trials for secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with esrd 
this increase is also due in part to the company assuming research and development expenses for d hormone analogs contributed by lunar corporation in october interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal year the increase is primarily the result of interest earned on capital contributions made in fiscal by lunar and draxis health care  inc  the company s shareholders at the time of the contributions 
on may   lunar distributed its ownership of the company to its shareholders 
at june   the company had state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which will begin expiring in and federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which will begin expiring in during the period from june  to may   lunar realized certain federal income tax savings that were attributable to losses incurred by bone care 
as part of a tax disaffiliation agreement  lunar paid the company  for the benefit of these tax savings 
year ended june  versus the company s d hormone related research and development expenses totaled  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the increase is due primarily to higher expenditures on one alpha d clinical trials for secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with esrd 
interest expense was  in fiscal year compared to  fiscal year interest expense during these periods relates exclusively to loans made by lunar to the company 
interest income was  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the increase is primarily the result of interest earned on capital contributions 
in october  in exchange for additional shares of bone care common stock  lunar canceled outstanding loans in the amount of approximately  the company s net loss for fiscal year was  compared to its net loss of  for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations through a combination of capital contributions  license agreements and sales of bulk drugs and contract services 
all of these third party collaborative research and licensing agreements have either expired or terminated 
cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  for the year ended june  these funds are currently invested primarily in a government securities money market mutual fund 
this decrease is primarily due to increased research and development activities  including clinical trials of one alpha d and pre clinical development of other d hormones 
management believes that the current level of cash and cash equivalents are adequate to finance the company s current operations at least through the end of calendar after that time  the company will require additional funds for research and development activities 
additional funds also could be required before that time if the company were to expand the scope of its activities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms
