the increase is mainly attributable to the addition to the company s consolidated financial statements of sales of million at direct steel  inc  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company in june and sales of million attributable to the operation of the new hamilton assets at the processing center acquired on november  excluding the effect of these transactions  the company s sales increased million  or 
volume of tons shipped was up accounting for a million sales increase  offset by an aggregate decrease in sales dollars per ton of million due to a decline in average selling price  resulting from a mix shift to lower revenue products 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  up million or over fiscal as a percent of sales  it was down from in the prior year reflecting several factors 
startup costs associated with the new ottawa facility decreased the margins by approximately million for fiscal  approximately  of which affected the fourth fiscal quarter 
additionally  a fourth quarter charge related to the cessation of brokerage activities reduced gross profit by approximately  for the year 
with the consolidation of direct steel  a greater proportion of sales activity was weighted by a lower margin mix of business 
the effect of higher raw material costs  particularly in the fourth fiscal quarter  also reduced margins 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million in fiscal were million over the fiscal level 
as a percentage of sales  expenses decreased to from 
increased expenses were attributable principally to incremental activities associated with direct steel and the new hamilton asset acquisitions  while the lower percentage level reflected the comparison of the expense level on the higher sales activity level 
sg a expenses net of acquisitions increased  reflecting higher expenses associated with normal salary increases and the company s general growth plan 
income from equity investment at direct steel was  for fiscal subsequent to june   the operations were consolidated with the company s and no longer reported as income from equity investment 
interest expense was million  an increase of  but of net sales in fiscal  down from of net sales in fiscal lower interest expense through the third quarter of fiscal reflected lower borrowing levels associated with decreased inventory levels resulting from improved inventory management and lower rates 
these favorable effects more than offset the increased interest costs attributable to acquisition activity 
the consolidation of direct steel increased interest expense by  from fiscal levels 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the capitalization of interest costs associated with the ottawa expansion project ended and these financing costs began to be reflected as interest expense  impacting the year to year comparison by  income taxes for fiscal were million or

of net sales 
the effective tax rates computed on income exclusive of income loss from equity investment were down slightly in the current year at versus in the prior fiscal year 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income for fiscal was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal the company expects that net income for fiscal will continue to reflect operation of the expanded ottawa facility at below break even levels through the first half of the fiscal year  with a positive contribution to net income by the second half of the fiscal year 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased million  or  to million 
this was the result of lower shipment levels as tonnage decreased or an million decrease in revenue 
sales of almost all the company s products decreased over the course of the year as customers adjusted their inventory levels to bring them in line with curtailed production schedules reflecting declines in economic activity 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to compared to in the prior year 
the decline is attributable to two factors 
first  lower volume levels required that fixed costs be absorbed over lower revenues  resulting in decreased margins generally 
additionally  downward pressure on steel prices  particularly in the company s canadian operations  created lower margins as the market adjusted to lower steel prices in advance of these lower prices being reflected in the company s inventories 
somewhat countering the pressure from this high cost inventory was the liquidation of inventories accounted for on the lifo basis in the united states  which generated approximately  of pre tax income over the course of the fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  to million  though the percent of sales measure increased to from due to lower revenue levels 
the decrease in spending reflected lower sales commission and lower expenses for compensation plans related to the company s financial results  somewhat offset by staffing increases and normal salary cost increases 
income from equity investment was a loss of  for the year  a decrease of  from prior year s income of  this decline in earnings principally reflected the effect of downward pressure on steel prices as discussed above 
interest expense was million  or of net sales for fiscal  a decrease of  from the previous year 
although borrowing levels were higher in the current year   of the interest cost on this higher level of borrowing was capitalized as part of the cost of the ottawa expansion project 
income taxes decreased million primarily as a result of the decrease in income before taxes 
the effective tax rates computed on income exclusive of income loss from equity investment were down slightly in the current year at versus in the prior year 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income for fiscal was million or of net sales 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital primarily to fund working capital needs  capital projects  including the acquisition  expansion and improvement of facilities  machinery and equipment and to acquire complementary steel related businesses consistent with the company s growth strategy to increase its size and profitability 
the company met its capital requirements in fiscal through cash flow from operations and from borrowings under credit facilities 
during fiscal  the company generated cash flow from operating activities of million 
contributing to cash inflows in the current year were net income  non cash depreciation and amortization  and a reduction in inventory levels which resulted from improved inventory management 
a decrease in accounts payable and a modest increase in receivables offset the inventory reduction 
cash flows used for investing activities in fiscal consisted of million of capital spending of which million was in connection with the ottawa expansion project 
in addition  the acquisition of the new hamilton assets for million in november  together with the acquisition of the remaining outstanding stock of direct steel  inc in june for million  accounted for total cash used for acquisitions of million 
cash flows from financing activities provided million for fiscal proceeds of million from a new term loan in december were used to fund the ottawa expansion project and reduce bank borrowings under the company s primary line of credit 
additional term loan proceeds were derived from a refinancing agreement entered into by direct steel 
the company was in compliance with covenant requirements under all of its credit facilities as of march  the company s various bank lending arrangements provide a maximum borrowing availability of approximately million of which was outstanding at march  the company renegotiated its lines of credit to extend their expiration dates and lower interest rates  and entered into a term loan agreement to fund the ottawa expansion project 
management expects that cash generated from operating activities and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next twelve months 
as the company pursues its growth strategy of expanding through core business acquisitions  capital requirements may change and the company may from time to time seek additional financing 
seasonality the company has in the past experienced lower levels of sales in the months of july  november  and december  due primarily to holiday periods and customer plant shutdowns 
inflation impact of changing prices the company s largest component of cost of sales is raw material costs 
these costs can vary over time due to changes in steel pricing which the company typically passes on to customers 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on the results of its operations over the periods presented 
environmental matters the company s facilities are subject to numerous federal  state  provincial and local regulations related to environmental protection and compliance with such regulations is a factor in the company s operations 
the company has made  and intends to make  expenditures necessary to comply with such regulations 
under existing laws and regulations  the company believes that compliance will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition
