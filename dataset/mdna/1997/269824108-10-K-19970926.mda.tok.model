item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in and during the remainder of the s focused on developing and marketing a software application product for use by roadway design professionals 
in  the company  under new management  began to expand significantly its product line to include complementary software application products for use by a variety of aec professionals 
over half of the company s software modules were added through acquisitions 
on january   the company added modules of landscape architecture environmental planning application software as a result of the landcadd acquisition 
on march   the company added modules of geographic information systems software to its product line as a result of the fms acquisition 
on november   the company added modules of structural engineering software as a result of the ecom merger 
on july   the company added modules of building designed construction software as a result of the cibc acquisition 
the landcadd acquisition  the fms acquisition and the cibc acquisition  were each accounted for under the purchase method  and accordingly  the results of operations of such businesses are included in the company s results from their respective dates of acquisition 
for each acquisition  the aggregate cost over the fair value of acquired net assets has been assigned principally to purchased research and development and software development costs based on their estimated fair market values 
the portion of the aggregate purchase prices allocated to research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was charged to expense on the date of purchase 
accordingly  the company s results of operations reflect a non recurring charge for purchased research and development of approximately  for fiscal and million for fiscal the ecom merger was accounted for as a pooling of interest  however  it did not have a material effect on financial statement and therefore such statements have not been restated 
the company resells autocad in order to facilitate the additional sales of the company s software application products 
resales of autocad represented approximately of net revenues in fiscal the resales of autocad carry a substantially lower gross margin than sales of eagle point software products and represented approximately of gross profit in the same period 
the company has been notified by autodesk that as of january   the company will no longer be allowed to resell autocad 
this will have an adverse effect on revenues and gross profit and could also have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell it s own products 
see risk factors competition 
the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
factors such as the timing of new product introductions and upgrades by the company  the company s competitors or autodesk  customer acceptance of software applications  product development expenses  announcements or changes in pricing policies by competitors  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  the mix of domestic versus international revenues  the existence of product errors or bugs  and the hiring and training of additional staff could contribute to this variability of quarterly results 
economic and other factors affecting the building  construction  architecture  mapping and engineering industries could also affect demand for the company s products in one or more particular quarters 
the company historically has operated with little or no backlog 
a significant portion of the company s net revenues in a quarter are derived from orders received later in that quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and quarterly results difficult to forecast 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels  and a shortfall in revenues could result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income 
as the markets in which the company competes mature and new and existing companies compete for customers  price competition is likely to intensify and such competition could affect quarterly operating results

the company expects to continue repurchasing stock in fiscal year the company believes that it s current cash position  together with funds generated from operations and borrowings available under its line of credit  will be sufficient to fund its operations through fiscal inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date  nor does the company expect it to have a significant impact in fiscal year the company has experienced insignificant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions since substantially all of its international sales to date have been billed in us dollars 
as the company continues to expand its international operations it may begin billing in foreign currencies which would increase the company s exposure to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts if deemed appropriate at that time
