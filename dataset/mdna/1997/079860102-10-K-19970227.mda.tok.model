the decrease in was also attributable to lacps in florida  georgia and north carolina as well as south carolina and mississippi 
these plans and future implementation of other such plans in bellsouth telecommunications service region  coupled with competition from the interexchange carriers in the intralata toll market  will adversely impact future toll message volumes 
the expansion of lacps and some effects of competition result in the transfer of calls from toll to the local service and access categories  respectively  but the corresponding revenues are not generally shifted at commensurate rates

 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
substantially all of the curtailment losses relate to postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under this plan  bellsouth telecommunications expects to reduce the work force of the wireline telephone operations by approximately  employees by the end of the work force reduction will be accomplished through the separation of approximately  employees  partially offset by the planned hiring of new employees primarily to replace those not expected to relocate in connection with the consolidation of work locations

bellsouth enters into foreign exchange forward contracts  currency swap agreements and interest rate swap agreements in its normal course of business for hedging purposes 
these financial instruments are used to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risks  although to a limited extent they expose the company to market and credit risks 
the credit risks associated with these instruments are controlled through the evaluation and continual monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
in the event that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract or agreement  bellsouth s exposure is limited to the then current value of the currency rate or interest rate differential  not the full notional amount 
such contracts and agreements have been executed with creditworthy financial institutions whose credit ratings are generally aa aa or higher 
as such  bellsouth considers the risk of nonperformance to be remote 
see note n to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
operating environment and trends of the business regulatory environment 
in providing telecommunications services  bellsouth is subject to regulation by both state and federal regulators with respect to rates  services  competition and other issues 
bellsouth s primary regulatory focus has been directed toward modifying the regulatory process to one that is more closely aligned with changing market conditions and overall public policy objectives 
as an alternative to regulation of intrastate earnings  bellsouth has sought price regulation  whereby prices of basic service are regulated and the pricing of other products and services are based on market factors 
while price regulation plans do not provide for the direct recovery through basic service rates of cost increases or extraordinary expenses  they generally provide more flexibility to meet competitive pricing levels 
bellsouth telecommunications has price regulation plans approved or authorized in all states in its wireline territory  although the implementation of the tennessee plan has been stayed by a court pending resolution of a number of issues 
at the federal level  bellsouth telecommunications is operating under a price regulation plan established by the federal communications commission fcc in this plan provided a productivity option  which bellsouth telecommunications selected  that eliminated both earnings limitations and sharing requirements 
economy 
the nation s output of goods and services  which grew in  grew at a moderate rate of in employment in nonfarm business establishments grew during the year and the unemployment rate averaged 
the economy of the nine state region served by bellsouth telecommunications wireline telephone business grew slightly faster than the national economy 
the number of jobs in nonfarm businesses grew as the unemployment rate averaged for the year 
real income expanded at an estimated 
net migration added approximately  persons  accounting for half of the region s population growth 
the demand for telecommunications services in the region reflected the strength of its economic and population growth 
moderate economic expansion is expected during  as tight labor markets  slow labor force growth and modest productivity growth act to constrain the pace of growth 
the region s cost advantages and strong net migration should bring an economic growth rate comparatively better than the nation s and further increase the demand for telecommunications services 
the increased competition faced by bellsouth telecommunications and the growing percentage of revenues from unregulated businesses make bellsouth s financial performance more susceptible to changes in the economy than previously  as its operations reflect the more competitive business environment and the greater demand elasticities for its products and services 
competition 
bellsouth is subject to increasing competition in all areas of its business 
regulatory  legislative and judicial actions and technological developments have expanded the types of available services and products and the number of companies that may offer them 
increasingly  this competition is from large companies which have substantial capital  technological and marketing resources 
the act 
the act requires the elimination of state legislative and regulatory barriers to competition for local telephone service  subject only to competitively neutral requirements to preserve and advance universal service  protect the public safety and welfare  maintain the quality of telecommunications services and safeguard the rights of customers 
the act also includes requirements that bellsouth negotiate with other carriers for interconnection  use of network elements on an unbundled basis and resale of local services 
if a negotiated agreement cannot be reached  either party may seek arbitration with the state regulatory authority or the fcc if the state fails to act 
if rates are disputed  the arbitrator must set rates for access to network elements on an unbundled basis  based on cost  which may include a reasonable profit 
bellsouth is also required to negotiate to provide retail services at wholesale rates for the purposes of resale by competing carriers 
if agreement cannot be reached  the arbitrator shall set the wholesale rates at bellsouth s retail rates less costs to be avoided 
bellsouth telecommunications has executed over interconnection or resale agreements with such carriers and is currently involved in arbitration proceedings with a number of other carriers  including at t  mci and sprint 
the arbitration results for the wholesale discount rates vary by state from approximately to 
in connection with the requirements of the act  in august  the fcc released an order adopting rules governing interconnection and open competition in the local telephone service industry the order 
among the issues specifically addressed by the order are the network elements that bellsouth must make available  pricing standards to be followed by states in setting rates for interconnection  access to network elements on an unbundled basis and resold services 
bellsouth and several other incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs joined in an appeal of the order to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit the court 
upon request of several state commissions and ilecs  the court stayed the order in part  pending appeal 
such stay relates to pricing prescriptions and certain other terms 
the court heard oral arguments in january  and a decision is pending 
notwithstanding these developments  however  as discussed above  bellsouth telecommunications and a number of carriers have negotiated interconnection agreements and state regulatory commissions are arbitrating or have approved various terms of interconnection between bellsouth telecommunications and other carriers 
these terms may be revised  depending on  among other things  the outcome of the appeal of the order 
the act also requires the fcc to identify the local service subsidy provided by access charges  to provide for the removal of such subsidy from access rates in order that access charges reflect underlying costs  to arrange for a universal service fund to ensure the continuation of universal service  and to develop the arrangements for payments into that fund by all carriers 
the fcc is currently engaged in this proceeding 
in addition  the fcc has commenced a proceeding to revise its access charge rules 
until final orders are issued by the fcc and any judicial appeals have been concluded  it will not be possible to determine the impact on access charge revenues  however  an interim access charge plan provides for lower access charges paid by carriers that purchase unbundled network elements from ilecs or that connect wireless communications with the wireline networks of the ilecs 
in attempting to comply with the technical requirements of interconnection  bellsouth expects to incur significant costs associated with the development or modification of systems necessary to make interconnection possible 
for example  bellsouth telecommunications will be required to provide for long term number portability whereby customers switching to competing local carriers will be able to retain their telephone numbers without interruption 
it is unclear as to what degree bellsouth will be able to recover these costs 
until the fcc issues final orders on matters such as access reform  universal service and number portability  as well as other matters  and any judicial appeals have been concluded  it will not be possible to determine the impact the act will have on bellsouth s financial position or annual operations results or cash flows 
wireless services 
the fcc s pcs licensing process allows multiple new competitors for bellsouth s businesses 
licenses to provide pcs services have been won in auction by at t  bell holding company consortia and other large and well capitalized entities 
pcs will provide competition to bellsouth s local wireline and wireless telephone businesses 
several competitive pcs systems are now operational 
in many markets  competing cellular service is provided by businesses owned or controlled by a bell holding company  at t or a major telephone company 
in addition  bell atlantic corporation and nynex corporation have combined their cellular businesses  and u s west  inc and airtouch communications have announced that they plan to merge their cellular businesses 
those four companies have also formed a joint venture to provide pcs in many domestic markets 
bellsouth competitive strategy 
bellsouth has developed three main strategies that govern its business decisions in the increasingly competitive telecommunications industry 
first  bellsouth will strengthen its leadership position throughout its nine state wireline territory by a enhancing and building its brand strength and distribution channels  b providing full service offerings including wireline and wireless  local and long distance  and video and electronic commerce services  and c controlling costs 
second  bellsouth will continue to grow profitably its domestic wireless business by a deploying value added products and services and competitive technology  b strengthening and expanding distribution channels including joint marketing with bellsouth telecommunications  and c expanding in region wireless coverage through successful bidding for pcs licenses and other acquisitions 
third  bellsouth will continue to grow and develop its latin american and other international operations 
new services 
notwithstanding the inevitable loss of local service customers and other risks associated with increased competition  bellsouth will have the opportunity to benefit from entry into new business markets 
for example  the presence of competition  among other things  can allow bellsouth to qualify to offer interlata wireline service under provisions contained in the act 
bellsouth believes that in order to remain competitive in the future  it must aggressively pursue a corporate strategy of expanding its offerings beyond its traditional businesses and markets 
these offerings include interlata services  information services and video and electronic commerce services 
bellsouth has entered some of these businesses through investments in  strategic alliances with and acquisitions of established companies in such industries and through the development of some of these services and capabilities internally 
for example  among other initiatives  bellsouth has acquired several cable tv rights  is conducting a trial of cable tv service and is providing internet access 
bellsouth also intends to continue to pursue certain foreign telecommunications licenses as they are offered 
bellsouth plans to begin offering interlata wireline service in each of its in region states as soon as the fcc approves its application for each state 
bellsouth has filed documents with the georgia public service commission requesting that the georgia commission approve a statement of generally available terms and conditions as provided for in the act and to establish that such terms and conditions meet the competitive checklist 
bellsouth will file an application for each state as soon as it believes the conditions are met 
because of the proceedings required to obtain approval and the potential challenges of competitors and others  it is uncertain when bellsouth will be authorized to commence interlata service in any of its in region states 
the act requires that in region interlata service be provided through a subsidiary separate from bellsouth telecommunications 
joint marketing 
the act allows bellsouth to market wireless and other services jointly with its wireline local exchange services  previously  separate marketing was required 
this change has enabled bellsouth to more efficiently offer and provide integrated telecommunications 
in march  bellsouth began joint marketing of wireless and wireline services in selected markets 
in addition  as permitted by the act  bellsouth intends to jointly market other services such as video  internet access and  eventually  interlata service with its wireline and wireless services 
work force reduction 
as another part of its competitive strategy  bellsouth telecommunications announced in a plan to reduce its work force by approximately  employees by the end of also  in  bellsouth telecommunications completed the restructuring of its telephone operations that had been announced in
