nature of operations xilinx  inc xilinx or the company designs  develops and markets cmos complementary metal oxide silicon programmable logic devices and related design software 
the company s programmable logic product lines include field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds 
these components are standard integrated circuits ics programmed by xilinx s customers to perform desired logic operations 
xilinx introduced the first fpga device in  holds patents on certain programmable logic device pld architecture and technology  and continues to be the leading supplier of programmable logic solutions 
xilinx also markets hardwire devices  which are mask programmed ics functionally equivalent to programmed fpgas 
the company s products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in the computer  peripheral  telecommunications  networking  industrial control  instrumentation  high reliability military and consumer markets 
the company markets its products throughout the world through a direct sales organization  direct sales to manufacturers by independent sales representative firms  sales through licensed domestic distributors and sales through foreign distributors 
xilinx s products have provided effective solutions to a wide range of customer logic requirements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data both as percentages of annual revenues and as percentage changes from the prior year s results 
increase decrease years ended march  from prior year revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development marketing  general and administrative operating income before non recurring charges non recurring charges nm nm operating income interest income and other net income before taxes provision for income taxes net income includes write off of discontinued product family of million 
revenue revenues for fiscal increased to million  representing an increase of from million for and from the million reported for the level of revenues in fiscal was significantly impacted by a semiconductor industry inventory correction which reduced customer demand 
the company s revenue increase in was primarily attributable to the revenue growth of the xc product family  introduced in fiscal  as well as the growth of the company s xc product family  offset by decreased revenues derived from the company s first generation products including the xc family and non proprietary products in the company s xc product family  where there is a second source competitor 
revenues from the xc and xcx family increased between and to million  and revenues for the xc family increased from million in to million in revenue contribution by programmable logic product line reflected a mix between increased customer demand for low cost  medium range density programmable logic devices and the functionality and performance provided by the company s higher density and higher speed programmable logic devices 
revenues from proprietary products  for which there is no second source competitor  increased from of aggregate revenues in to in in the fourth quarter of  proprietary products accounted for of total revenues as compared to for the comparable quarter 
deriving revenues from proprietary products has been emphasized by the company as an effective corporate pricing strategy that has as its aim to expand the market for its products by reducing sales prices coincident with and commensurate with reductions in the cost of manufacturing these products 
the company currently intends to continue actively pursuing a strategy of broadening the markets it serves through the enhancement of software design tools  the introduction of architectures offering new functionality  and the reduction of ic prices through continuous advancements in the silicon manufacturing process 
revenues for the company s first generation products  which include the xc  xc and xc families  represented of aggregate component revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the company s second generation products  including the xc  xcx and xc families  represented of aggregate component revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal revenues from other products  which include the cpld families  hardwire and serial proms  were relatively comparable between and during  all second generation product families experienced increases in unit volume 
the average selling price for plds decreased approximately in relative to the previous year  although the average selling price of a pld product family decreased by up to during the year 
individual products within certain families decreased in price as much as during the past year  as prices were reduced in order to expand market share while realizing acceptable returns 
price erosion of this magnitude has been common in the semiconductor industry  as advances in both architecture and manufacturing process technology have permitted continual reductions in cost 
the company relies upon introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors such that higher average selling prices and higher margins are achievable despite the price erosion on mature product lines 
xilinx s design software is used by the company s customers to implement designs in the company s programmable logic devices 
software revenues remained relatively comparable from to at million as compared to million in cumulative licenses for proprietary design software distributed to customers through the end of totaled approximately  units  as compared to  and  units at the end of and  respectively 
software sales as a percentage of total revenues represented of revenues in and and in no single end customer accounted for more than of revenues in or of revenues in or international revenues constituted approximately  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
international revenues continue to be primarily to customers in europe and japan 
revenue growth in these international markets over the past year was and  respectively 
the company s manufacturing facility in dublin  ireland  continues to increase production levels and has enhanced the company s ability to meet the needs of its international customers 
the company believes that international revenues will continue to grow at a faster rate in the future than domestic sales  and projects that such revenues will eventually comprise of the worldwide total 
however  there can be no assurances that international revenues will reach this level in the future 
sales to pacific rim  middle east and other regions outside north america  europe and japan represented approximately of revenues in  and the company believes that the semiconductor industry inventory correction has ended  as the company experienced sequential quarterly increases in orders and revenues during the last two quarters of fiscal gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for  excluding the impact of a million write off of the xc product family of one time programmable antifuse devices see below 
gross margins in and were and  respectively 
the increase in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in was primarily attributable to selling price reductions and increased inventory reserves relating to an expanded level of inventory  partially offset by the favorable impact of lower wafer costs  reflecting reduced prices from wafer suppliers and the impact of the strengthened us dollar exchange rate against the yen  and improved yields 
over the past three years  xilinx has also been able to offset much of the erosion in gross margin percentages on more mature integrated circuits with increased volumes of newer  proprietary  higher margin products  although no assurance can be given that the company will do so in the future 
the company recognizes that ongoing price reductions for its integrated circuits are a significant element in expanding the market for its products 
company management believes that future gross margin objectives in the range of to of revenues are more consistent with expanding market share while realizing acceptable returns  although there can be no assurance that future gross margins will be in this range 
during fiscal  the company discontinued the xc family of one time programmable antifuse devices 
as a result  the company recorded a pretax charge against earnings of million 
this charge primarily related to the write off of inventory and for termination charges related to purchase commitments to foundry partners for work in process wafers which had not completed the manufacturing process 
research and development the company has increased the amount spent on research and development each year in its thirteen year history 
research and development expenses in exceeded those of the prior year by and those of by 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in  and was impacted by the level of revenues experienced in the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to increased headcount and labor expenses  increased purchases of engineering wafers and increased facility and support costs associated with an expanded scope of operations 
the company remains committed to a significant level of research and development effort in order to continue to compete aggressively in the programmable logic marketplace 
through march   the company has received us patents and maintains an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of software  ic architecture and design 
as of march   research and development personnel were split approximately for software development and for ic design and process development 
xilinx has not capitalized any of the costs associated with its software development 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative costs represented  and of revenues in   and  respectively 
the increase in costs as a percentage of revenue in over is a reflection of the level of revenues experienced in sales and support expenses have increased each year due to increased personnel and labor costs and increased commissions due to changes in the revenue channel mix 
the company has twenty two sales offices located throughout the united states and canada  including the metropolitan areas of san jose  los angeles  denver  dallas  chicago  minneapolis  atlanta  raleigh  philadelphia and boston as well as eight international sales offices located in the metropolitan areas of london  munich  paris  stockholm  tokyo  taipei  seoul and hong kong 
there was a increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses during  as compared to this was primarily attributable to increases in headcount and employee expenses  partially offset by reduced discretionary spending 
the company remains committed to controlling administrative expenses 
however  the timing and extent of future legal costs associated with the ongoing enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights are not readily predictable and may significantly increase the level of general and administrative expenses in the future 
non recurring charges during fiscal  the company incurred a million non recurring write off of in process technology relating to the acquisition of neocad  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company incurred a million write off of a minority investment in star semiconductor corporation 
operating income operating income of million decreased from the prior year s million but increased from s million 
operating income in was million before consideration of the write off of the xc product family 
operating income as a percentage of revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
before consideration of non recurring charges and write offs  operating income as a percentage of revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in from is primarily a result of the revenue growth in in comparison to increases year to year in research and development spending and marketing  general and administrative spending 
operating income as a percentage of revenues could be adversely impacted in future years by the factors noted herein 
interest  net the company incurs interest expense on the million of convertible subordinated notes issued in november the company earns interest income on its cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted investments 
the amount of interest earned is a function of the balance of cash invested as well as prevailing interest rates 
the company also records of the net income of united silicon inc usi  a wafer fabrication joint venture in which the company participates  as joint venture equity income 
to date  usi s net income has resulted primarily from interest earned on its investment portfolio 
net interest and other income for increased by million over in  the increased interest and other income is primarily attributable to higher investment portfolio balances and joint venture equity income 
the company expects that the usi joint venture will begin to ramp up operations over the next year  and that the company may incur joint venture equity losses during the start up phase 
the company s investment portfolio contains tax advantaged municipal securities which have pretax yields which are less than the interest rate on the convertible subordinated notes 
for financial reporting purposes  the company effectively records the difference between the pretax and tax equivalent yields as a reduction in provision for taxes on income 
as a result of the difference in yields  future uses of the investment portfolio and operating results for usi  levels of net interest and other income could decrease in the future 
provision for income taxes xilinx s effective tax rate was for as compared to and for and  respectively 
the tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by legislation reinstating the r d tax credit as well as increased profits in foreign operations where the tax rate is lower than the us rate 
excluding the write off of in process technology  in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was 
inflation to date  the effects of inflation upon the company s financial results have not been significant 
factors affecting future results dependence upon independent manufacturers and subcontractors the company does not manufacture the wafers used for its products 
in  most of the company s wafers were manufactured by seiko epson corporation seiko epson and united microelectronics corporation umc 
the company has depended upon these suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes  including transitioning to advanced process technologies  producing wafers at acceptable yields  and delivering them to the company in a timely manner 
while the timeliness  yield and quality of wafer deliveries have met the company s requirements to date  there can be no assurance that the company s wafer suppliers will not experience future manufacturing problems  including delays in the realization of advanced process technologies 
the company is also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly services 
any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and cost attributes  adequate yields or timely deliveries from these manufacturers subcontractors  or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply  could delay shipments  and have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s long term growth will depend in large part on the company s ability to obtain increased wafer fabrication capacity from suppliers 
a significant increase in general industry demand or any interruption of supply could reduce the company s supply of wafers or increase the company s cost of such wafers  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in order to secure additional wafer capacity  the company from time to time considers alternatives  including  without limitation  equity investments in  or loans  deposits  or other financial commitments to  independent wafer manufacturers to secure production capacity  or the use of contracts which commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
although the company is currently able to obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner  the company has at times been unable  and may in the future be unable  to fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints  including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services in satisfaction of customer delivery dates  as well as the ability of the company to process products for shipment 
the company s future growth will depend in part on its ability to locate and qualify additional suppliers and subcontractors and to increase its own capacity to ship products  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
any increase in these constraints on the company s production could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in this regard  the company has entered into the usi joint venture with umc and other parties to obtain wafer capacity from a new wafer fabrication facility 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements and the commitments discussion within financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
however  there are many risks associated with the construction of a new facility  and there can be no assurance that such facility will become operational and or cost effective in a timely manner 
in addition  the company has entered into an agreement with seiko epson to obtain additional capacity from a facility currently under construction and expected to provide wafers in calendar see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item and the commitments discussion within financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  in item if the company requires additional capacity and such capacity is unavailable  or unavailable on reasonable terms  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
impact of currency the company s purchases of the processed silicon wafers used in its integrated circuits from japanese foundries have been denominated in yen 
to reduce the company s exposure for yen denominated liabilities  the company s sales into japan are denominated in yen 
in the past  the company has periodically limited its net exposure to fluctuations in the yen to us dollar exchange rates through the use of forward exchange or option contracts 
based on existing agreements with wafer suppliers  which should result in decreased yen denominated wafer receipts in the future  the company believes that its net exposure relating to fluctuations in the yen to us dollar exchange rate could decline  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
as a result  the company may need to adjust its future hedging strategy 
in addition  the company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of future exchange fluctuations relating to the new taiwan dollar usi joint venture investment 
litigation the company is currently involved in patent litigation with altera corporation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and item  legal proceedings 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time 
management believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and is defending them vigorously 
the foregoing is a forward looking statement subject to risks and uncertainties  and the future outcome could differ materially due to the uncertain nature of the litigation with altera and because the lawsuits are still in the pre trial stage 
other factors affecting operating results the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competitive pressure and cyclical market patterns 
the company s results of operations are affected by a wide variety of factors  including general economic conditions  conditions relating to technology companies  conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  decreases in average selling prices over the life of any particular product  the timing of new product introductions by the company  its competitors and others  the ability to manufacture in a timely manner sufficient quantities of a given product  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors  and the impact of new technologies resulting in rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep decline in demand for others 
market demand for the company s products  particularly for those most recently introduced  can be difficult to predict  especially in light of customers demands to shorten product lead times and minimize inventory levels 
unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if the company were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in a given quarter 
in addition  any difficulty in achieving targeted wafer production yields could adversely impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
due to the foregoing and other factors  past results  including those described in this report  are a much less reliable predictor of the future than is the case in many older  more stable and less dynamic industries 
based on the factors noted herein  the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results 
the company s future success depends in large part on its ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products which address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price and performance 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion of new product designs  the ability to utilize advanced process technologies  achievement of acceptable yields  availability of supporting design software and market acceptance 
no assurance can be given that the company s product development efforts will be successful or that its new products will achieve market acceptance 
revenues relating to the company s first generation fpga products are expected to continue to decline in the future as a percentage of aggregate component revenues  and the company will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from second generation fpgas and future generation products 
in addition  the average selling price for any particular product tends to decrease rapidly over the product s life 
to offset such decreases  the company relies primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors such that higher average selling prices and higher margins are achievable relative to mature product lines 
to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  or the company s products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s fpga and cpld products compete in the programmable logic marketplace  with a substantial majority of the company s revenues derived from its fpga product families 
the industries in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and continuous price erosion 
the company expects significantly increased competition both from existing competitors and from a number of companies that may enter its market 
xilinx believes that important competitive factors in the programmable logic market include price  product performance and reliability  adaptability of products to specific applications  ease of use and functionality of design software  and the ability to provide timely customer service and support 
the company s strategy for expansion in the programmable logic market includes continued price reductions commensurate with the ability to lower the cost of manufacture for established products and continued introduction of new product architectures which address high volume  low cost applications as well as high performance  leading edge density applications 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving these strategies 
the company s major sources of competition are comprised of three elements the manufacturers of custom cmos gate arrays  providers of high density programmable logic products characterized by fpga type architectures and other providers of programmable logic products 
the company competes with custom gate array manufacturers on the basis of lower design costs  shorter development schedules and reduced inventory risks 
the primary attributes of custom gate arrays are high density  high speed and low production costs in high volumes 
the company continues to develop lower cost architectures intended to narrow the gap between current custom gate array production costs in high volumes and fpga production costs 
the company competes with high density programmable logic suppliers on the basis of performance  the ability to deliver complete solutions to customers and customer support  taking advantage of the primary characteristics of flexible  high speed implementation and quick time to market capabilities of the company s pld product offerings 
in addition  the company competes with manufacturers of other programmable logic products on the basis of price  performance  design and software utility 
to the extent that such efforts to compete are not successful  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company relies upon patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect its intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
from time to time  third parties  including competitors of the company  have asserted exclusive patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future  that assertions by third parties will not result in costly litigation or that the company would prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources of the company 
any infringement claim or other litigation against or by the company could materially  adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  sales  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
particularly important are those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material  adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
sales outside of the united states carry a number of inherent risks  including risks of currency exchange fluctuations  government regulation of exports  tariffs and other potential trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the united states and generally longer receivable collection periods 
the company s business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import or export of semiconductor products 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the importation or exportation of the company s products in the future or what  if any  effect such actions would have on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in order to expand international sales and service  the company will need to maintain and expand existing foreign operations or establish new foreign operations 
this entails hiring additional personnel and maintaining or expanding existing relationships with international distributors and sales representatives 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources and could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its maintenance or expansion of existing foreign operations  in its establishment of new foreign operations or in its efforts to maintain or expand its relationships with international distributors or sales representatives 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and subject to  at various times  significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and overcapacity 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
many of the company s operations are centered in an area of california that has been seismically active 
should there be a major earthquake in this area  the company s operations may be disrupted resulting in the inability of the company to ship products in a timely manner  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations which may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition at march  remained strong 
total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by times  compared to times at march  since its inception  the company has used a combination of equity and debt financing and cash flow from operations to support on going business activities  make acquisitions and investments in complementary technologies  obtain facilities and capital equipment and finance inventory and accounts receivable 
total assets have grown from million in to million in the percentage changes of selected balance sheet items from march to march are shown below change from description to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments receivables inventories total current assets total assets total current liabilities stockholder s equity cash  cash equivalents and short term investments xilinx s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million in to million 
the company generated cash flow of approximately million from operating activities in  offset by million of cash used for investing activities  including the net proceeds from maturity of investments  investments in property  plant and equipment and advances for wafer purchases 
in addition  the company used million for financing activities  of which million was used to acquire treasury stock offset by million in proceeds from sales of common stock under employee option and stock purchase plans 
at march   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments represented of total assets 
receivables receivables decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of the decrease is primarily due to relatively even product shipments throughout the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding decreased from days in to days in inventories inventories increased from million at march to million at march inventory levels at march  represent days of inventory  which is higher than the company s objective of to days  compared to days at march  the semiconductor industry inventory correction contributed to the increase in inventory  as the company s customers focused on reducing their existing inventory levels 
additionally  inventory levels were impacted by improved yields and planned build of inventory to support the introduction of new product families 
the company seeks to balance two contradictory objectives with regard to inventory management 
on the one hand  the company believes that its standard  off the shelf products should be available for prompt shipment to customers 
accordingly  it attempts to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product  package and speed configurations to meet estimates of customer demand 
at the same time  the company also wishes to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to realize fully the opportunities for cost reductions associated with manufacturing process advancements 
the company continually strives to balance these two objectives so as to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost 
advances for wafer purchases see discussion under commitments  below 
property  plant and equipment during  xilinx invested million in property and equipment  as compared to million in during  the company completed construction of an million facility in boulder  colorado and continues to invest in software development tools and semiconductor design  test and manufacturing equipment in each of its manufacturing locations 
as the company s million ireland manufacturing facility was completed in fiscal  capital expenditures in fiscal were significantly lower than in the prior year 
current liabilities current liabilities decreased by to million at the end of the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in trade payables due to the timing of payments near year end 
line of credit the company has credit line facilities for up to million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  of which million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements for the company s ireland manufacturing facility 
at march  and  no borrowings were outstanding under the lines of credit 
long term debt in november  the company issued million in convertible subordinated notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity stockholders equity grew by in to million 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to million in net income and million related to the issuance of common stock in accordance with the company s stock plans and the tax benefit from stock options  offset by the million used to acquire  shares of treasury stock 
stockholders equity as a percentage of total assets was for and for commitments the company entered into a series of agreements with umc pursuant to which the company  umc and other parties formed the usi joint venture for the purpose of building and managing an advanced semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the agreement  the company invested approximately million in fiscal and expects to invest additional amounts totaling approximately million  for a equity interest in the venture 
as a result of its equity ownership  the company has rights to purchase a percentage of the facility s wafer production at current market prices 
during fiscal  the board of directors of usi voted to delay the wafer fabrication facility construction schedule 
as a result  the additional payments were also delayed and are now expected to be made in fiscal the revised schedule for construction of the facility and the related payments are subject to further change based on overall semiconductor industry conditions and other factors 
umc has committed to and is supplying the company with wafers manufactured in an existing facility until capacity is available in the new facility 
in fiscal  the company signed an agreement with seiko epson  a primary wafer supplier 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the agreement provides for an advance to seiko epson of up to million to be used in the construction of a wafer fabrication facility in japan  which will provide access to eight inch sub micron wafers 
in conjunction with the agreement  million installments were paid in may  november and may subsequent to fiscal  and further million installments are scheduled for november  and february  or upon the start of mass production  whichever is later 
the final installment for the advance payment of million is due on or after the later of april  or the date the outstanding balance of the advance payment is less than million 
as a result  the maximum outstanding amount of the advance payment at any time is million 
repayment of this advance will be in the form of wafer deliveries expected to begin in the first half of calendar specific wafer pricing will be based upon the prices of similar wafers manufactured by other  specifically identified  leading edge foundry suppliers 
the advance payment provision also provides for interest to be paid to the company in the form of free wafers 
in addition to the advance payments  the company may also provide further funding to seiko epson in the amount of million 
this additional funding would be paid after the final installment of the advance and the form of the additional funding will be negotiated at that time 
employees during  xilinx experienced a increase in the number of employees 
the company had  employees at the end of as compared to  at the end of the prior year 
the company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer supply capacity  procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities  development of new products  and potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that would complement the company s businesses and may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes
