item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview a substantial portion of the company s revenue is derived from new foodservice equipment requirements generated by openings of new facilities by national quick service restaurant chains  convenience store chains and specialty chains or their need to replace existing equipment 
since  the foodservice equipment market has grown  primarily as a result of the domestic and international growth of the major us restaurant chains 
in the most recent available data  the domestic operating unit growth rate of u 
s 
major restaurant chains was 
in addition  the major quick service restaurant chains have commenced significant international expansion 
in  the operating unit growth rate of the largest us restaurant chains in international markets was approximately which is nearly double its growth rate of in the company s largest customer  mcdonald s  alone accounts for more than of all international sales realized by the top us restaurant chains source technomics top 
also  the company s customers in the quick service restaurant industry have increased their demand for newer equipment  due in part to international expansion  menu expansion efforts  remodeling of existing stores and an increased emphasis on improved sanitation and labor and energy efficiency 
additionally  as store closings have slowed  management believes that there has been a decrease in the supply of used equipment 
management believes that  given the company s historic relationships with the major quick service restaurant chains  the company is well positioned to capitalize upon these growth opportunities 
also  the company has made certain operational changes which management believes have contributed to the company s improved results 
the company s financial performance is tied closely to its major customers demands for large quantities of mass produced customized products  or roll outs 
for example  from fiscal through the first six months of fiscal  the company s improved performance can be partially attributed to a continuing significant rise in the number of orders for refrigerated point of purchase displays by soft drink bottlers  primarily those associated with coca cola and pepsico products 
during the last six months of fiscal  the sales order backlog and demand for refrigerators from the soft drink bottlers returned to its historic pattern of being lower in the months of august through january as a result of lower demand from the bottler industry for point of purchase units 
however  during fiscal  sales of refrigeration equipment to the soft drink bottler industry increased  particularly internationally 
in the past  large roll outs of products such as taylor s clam shell grill have been similarly significant to the company s performance 
however  the ability to predict which customers and which products will experience roll outs is limited  and there can be no assurances that in any year the company will receive orders for any roll outs 
following the reorganization  the company recorded reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets reorganization value of million 
the company amortized reorganization value during the three year period ending march   which significantly affected net loss and stockholders equity 
such amortization  however  did not affect the company s cash flow
