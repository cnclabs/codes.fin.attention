liquidity and capital resources box energy corporation is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with activity and properties located in four core areas  offshore gulf of mexico  mississippi alabama  west texas new mexico and south texas 
over of the company s total revenues are generated from a group of four offshore gulf of mexico blocks  south pass blocks  and and west delta block of this group  oil and natural gas sales from south pass block accounts for approximately of bec s revenues with natural gas sales alone from this block accounting for almost of bec s revenues for this concentration of revenue is the result of a long term gas sales contract covering natural gas production from south pass block and a large quantity of production from natural gas reserves on this block 
the long term sales contract is a take or pay contract with prices significantly in excess of the spot market prices 
such prices escalate annually at 
gas sales revenue from south pass block accounted for approximately of the total revenues for and approximately of the total revenues for the company s long term strategy since has consisted of two key components  maximize the exploration  development and production of natural gas reserves in south pass block prior to the end of the gas sales contract in july and replace the value of the proved natural gas reserves from this block with additional reserves in the south pass area and the other core areas 
this strategy has driven the capital investment and exploration program of the company for the past two years and will continue to be the focus in the foreseeable future 
the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas expenditures 
under this method exploration costs incurred for d and d seismic and other geological  geophysical or prospecting costs are charged to exploration expense as incurred 
other capital costs are capitalized until it has been determined whether or not the property has commercial oil and natural gas reserves 
if proved oil and natural gas reserves are not found on a property then the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to exploration expense 
for purposes of the following table and related discussion however  the total capital and exploration costs are combined 
the following table depicts the capital expenditures by core area for the past three years as well as the current capital expenditure and exploration budget 
new operating management is currently reviewing all drilling anticipated for to ensure that the prospects meet the economic hurdles and fit the overall plans of the company 
area budget actual actual actual gulf of mexico     mississippi alabama    west texas new mexico    south texas   other onshore  total     capital and exploration expenditures in increased approximately compared to  primarily due to the increased drilling activity during prior to  the company  as a limited partnership  was limited to certain geographical areas  mainly the south pass block area 
as a result  during  and the company was building seismic data bases  leasehold positions and an inventory of drilling prospects 
in the company drilled wells on six prospects in the gulf of mexico  ten prospects in mississippi alabama  seven prospects in west texas new mexico and six prospects in south texas as compared to two  five  two  and one prospects in the respective areas in and two  zero  three  and zero prospects in the respective areas in capital and exploration expenditures for the gulf of mexico area included approximately million for platform fabrication  drilling and completion costs of three main pass block wells  million for an exploratory well in ship shoal block  million for an exploratory well in high island block  million for a successful exploratory well in eugene island block  million for one of three planned exploratory wells in south timbalier block and  for an exploratory well in west cameron block the company also invested million in the south pass blocks of which million was for a side track of well b s 
the company incurred over million for seismic and other geophysical activities during in the gulf of mexico 
other gulf of mexico capital expenditures totaling million include costs incurred in acquiring additional offshore blocks 
the company plans to sell or exchange part of its working interest in one or more of these blocks for interests in other offshore blocks 
projected capital and exploration expenditures for include costs budgeted at million to drill and complete three development wells and fabricate an offshore platform on eugene island block the company plans to drill prospects on south timbalier blocks  and for a total cost of million 
also included in the capital and exploration budget is million for an additional five offshore wells including one u sand well and one exploratory well in south pass block capital expenditures for the mississippi alabama area included approximately million for drilling and leasehold costs for the gladdis knight on the moselle dome prospect 
the company s independent petroleum engineers estimated initial proved reserves associated with this well of approximately  barrels and  as a result  the company expects to drill at least four additional wells in at an estimated cost of million 
the company also expended million on the indian wells field to drill three wells to offset the box davis discovery well and further define the extent of the reservoir 
although two of these wells did not encounter commercial reserves the total proved oil reserves on this field was  barrels at december  a fourth well is expected to be drilled in in this field 
the company invested  in the hub prospect for leasehold costs and drilling costs of the walker also included in capital and exploration expenditures in the mississippi alabama area are leasehold costs totaling  for prospects that are not yet drilled 
the remaining capital and exploration expenditures included million for seismic  geological and geophysical expenses and million for leasehold and drilling cost on prospects that were condemned by a dry hole or further seismic analysis 
in addition to the moselle dome wells  the company expects to drill two exploratory wells for million on identified prospects in and has budgeted million to drill three additional prospects currently being evaluated 
the company expects to spend approximately million on leases and seismic expense for in the mississippi alabama area 
during  capital and exploration expenditures in the west texas new mexico area included a development well and a salt water disposal well on the sw bronco field totaling  the remainder was for six exploratory wells on three prospects in west texas 
the company has identified five prospects to be drilled in in this area 
in south texas the company drilled several shallow wells and one deep well  the diebel on the berclair prospect for a total cost of  the total proved oil and natural gas reserves net to the company for this field was  barrels of oil and  mcf of natural gas 
the company plans to drill at least six exploration wells in the south texas area in the company finances capital expenditures primarily out of net cash flow from operations 
as stated above  a large portion of this cash flow is generated by natural gas sales from south pass block a majority of the natural gas production from this block is dependent on u sand wells on platform b  and an unforeseen mechanical or other failure of any one of these wells could potentially have an immediate and significant impact on the company s natural gas revenue  net income and net cash flow from operations 
the company currently has only one well producing from the u sand  well b s 
an attempt to recomplete a second producing well  well b s  during the fourth quarter of  was not successful 
a side track of well b s into the u sand reservoir was attempted late in  but the well encountered mechanical problems and the drilling activity was ceased pending further investigation of the available wellbore 
the company will continue its efforts to maximize production from the u sand during in the first quarter of the company learned that the operator  a working interest partner  and texas eastern are currently engaged in a dispute concerning their long term gas sales contracts covering production from south pass block which are similar to the one held by the company 
the exact details of the dispute are not known and the effect on the company s long term gas sales contract cannot be predicted at this time 
the company and phillips petroleum company are engaged in litigation concerning the npi in south pass block the trial is currently set to begin march  the company believes in the merit of its case  however  an adverse judgment or settlement could have a significant impact on the company s cash flow from operations and the current liquidity of the company s balance sheet 
net cash flow from operations increased to million in the increase resulted from an increase in oil and natural gas sales that resulted from a full year of production and revenue from south pass block platform d and sales of oil and natural gas from new properties which began producing in the increase in cash received from oil and natural gas sales was partially offset by an increase in operating  general and administrative  and reorganization expenses 
during the company used liquid assets of approximately million to fund the excess of capital expenditures over net cash flow from operations 
however  the company still maintains a strong balance sheet with current assets exceeding current liabilities by million and a current ratio of approximately to during the second quarter of  box energy established a million line of credit with a bank 
the line of credit with a current borrowing base of million was renewed in and again in the line of credit is secured by the company s south pass oil and natural gas properties 
the company has issued letters of credit to the minerals management service totaling  against this line 
if not extended  the credit facility will expire in june the company anticipates renewing this line or obtaining a similar line of credit at that time 
in december  the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes which are currently outstanding and due december  notes 
in the event of a change in control as defined in the indenture for the notes the indenture  the company is required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest 
bbhc owns of the class a stock of the company 
a sale or other disposition of those shares to any entity  person or group of persons not controlled by  or outside of  don d 
box  gary d 
box  douglas d 
box and thomas d 
box  would constitute a change in control under the notes 
in addition  the indenture defines a change in control to have occurred if at any time the existing board of directors does not have at least three independent directors as defined in the indenture 
the company currently has only three independent directors 
if any one of the independent directors were to cease to be a director  the company would be required to offer to repurchase the notes as stated above 
if a change in control were to occur the company may not have the current liquidity to repurchase the notes if all were tendered  and certain debt covenants in the million credit facility regarding current ratios may not be met 
therefore  the credit line may not be available without a debt covenant waiver or renegotiation of the credit facility 
in addition  the capital resources needed to implement the long term strategy would be reduced to reliance on cash flow from operations in the short term 
the company s balance sheets reflect a net deferred income tax asset of million and million on december  and  respectively 
this asset arises primarily as a result of federal income tax loss carryforwards of million and million for and  respectively  and million and million in temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of the company s oil and natural gas properties for and  respectively 
the company s tax basis in the oil and natural gas properties was carried over from okc limited partnership in april and principally consists of the sum of the individual partner s or unitholder s tax basis in the partnership s oil and natural gas properties  which exceeded the partnership s book basis as accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles 
the net operating loss carryforwards were generated in  and and will expire in  and  respectively 
based on the company s current projections  the deferred tax asset is expected to reverse during the next several years as significant taxable income is generated and the reserves near platform b are depleted 
such projection assumes that the company s natural gas production from platform b will be sold under its long term sales contract at prices significantly higher than current spot market prices 
if actual taxable income from future operations is substantially less than the current projections  the deferred tax asset would be impaired  causing an increase in the valuation allowance and a significant charge to earnings 
results of operations the following table discloses the net oil and natural gas sales volumes  average sales prices and average lifting costs for each of the three years ended december   and the table is an integral part of the following discussion of results of operations for the periods compared to and compared to increase increase decrease decrease net sales volumes oil mbbls natural gas mmcf    average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf average lifting costs per boe compared to the company incurred a net loss for totaling million  or per share 
this loss resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in exploration expenses  a million  or  increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on the oil and natural gas properties and a million  or  increase in general and administrative and reorganization expenses 
exploration expenses increased because of higher dry hole costs which resulted from the increased drilling activity 
the most significant dry holes drilled during the year included the following offshore gulf of mexico blocks  ship shoal block at million  high island block at million and west cameron block at  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased as a result of new properties being depleted  an increase in the depreciable basis of offshore platforms and a decrease in net oil and natural gas reserves 
general and administrative expenses and reorganization costs were higher because of an increase in legal fees primarily related to the reimbursement of legal fees to the estate of cloyce k 
box for the simplot litigation and the change in control which occurred when bbhc replaced the existing board of directors by a written consent effective july  the change in control triggered the applicability of severance agreements which then resulted in the payment of severance benefits in applicable situations 
resignations and terminations decreased the total number of employees from prior to july  to at december  management continues to analyze other areas for additional general and administrative savings 
natural gas revenue increased million primarily as a result of higher average natural gas prices 
although the average sales price shown on the table above reflects a decrease  such decrease in prices is a result of the lower percentage of total volume from south pass block sold at above market prices compared to a higher percentage of total volume from other areas which are sold at spot market prices during as compared to the prior years 
the per annum increase in the gas price for south pass block production  in accordance with the long term gas sales contract  resulted in an additional million in natural gas sales revenue 
average spot market prices for natural gas increased from in to for which added another million to natural gas sales revenue 
in addition  production from platform d located in south pass block  main pass block and other properties increased by bcf  or  when compared to resulting in an additional million in natural gas sales revenue 
however  the above increases were partially offset by a  mcf decrease in natural gas production from south pass block which  when combined with the high contract price received for production from this block lowered natural gas sales revenue by million 
natural gas production from south pass block decreased because the b well experienced mechanical difficulties in march and attempts to drill a replacement well in were not successful 
net natural gas production from south pass block decreased  mcf resulting in a decrease in natural gas sales revenue totaling  oil sales increased million  or  because of an increase in the average oil price of  from to and an increase in total oil production of  bbls 
the increase in price caused oil sales revenue to increase million  and the increase in production caused oil sales revenue to increase million 
oil production increased as a result of a full year of production from platform d producing from south pass block and west delta block  and new production from the indian wells field in mississippi and other onshore oil properties 
platform d production increased  bbls and new production from the indian wells field totaled  bbls in oil production from south pass blocks and decreased primarily as a result of natural depletion of the reservoirs 
in the company sold real estate properties in mississippi and louisiana for a total gain of million as part of a reorganization plan adopted in early in the gain from the sales of real estate in mississippi and louisiana was  the decrease was partially offset by a  increase in net oil trading income 
operating expenses were  or  higher in because of the increase in the number of operating properties which included a full year of operating cost from platform d in south pass block and a partial year of operating costs from main pass block net profits expense decreased approximately  or million primarily because of a net decrease in natural gas revenues from south pass block as described above 
compared to net income for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the primary reason for the decrease in net income is the decrease in natural gas production from platform b and the increase in exploration costs 
natural gas revenues during were million  constituting a decrease from natural gas production from platform b decreased bcf which in turn caused natural gas revenues to decrease by million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in production from platform c and initial production from platform d beginning in may  which increased production by mmcf and mmcf  respectively 
in addition  a increase in the price received for natural gas produced from platform b partially offset the decrease in natural gas revenue due to the lower production from platform b 
oil revenues increased from million for to million for this increase is the result of initial oil production from platform d  commencing in may production from platform d during the year was  barrels which added million to oil revenues 
increases in oil production from platform c and production from new wells located onshore added  to oil revenues  and a increase in the average price received during added  to oil revenues 
a decrease in the oil production from platform b of  barrels offset the aforementioned increases in oil revenues by million 
interest income increased  or  in due to additional funds invested during the year 
an increase in oil marketing income  gains on the sale of real estate properties in louisiana and mississippi  and the sale of the production deck from platform a located in south pass block caused other income to increase million for compared to operating costs increased to million for from million for as a result of workovers performed on platform b wells during the year and operating costs for platform d which commenced production in may net profits expense in decreased due to the lower oil and natural gas revenues from platform b  partially offset by lower capital costs charged against the net profits account 
exploration expenses increased million in  compared to  primarily as a result of an additional million in d and d seismic data purchased in the million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses resulted from the initial depreciation of platform d and the wells on that platform  an increase in depreciation expense on platform c resulting from an increased basis subject to depreciation  and an impairment loss recognized during the fourth quarter of as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
during the company adopted a reorganization plan which eliminated certain positions within the company 
a total of eight positions were terminated  including the director of corporate development and certain personnel involved with the management of the company s real estate properties in louisiana and mississippi 
total reorganization costs were  including severance pay  rent expense on the closed offices  and health insurance and related benefits for terminated employees 
income tax expense decreased by million in  compared to  as a result of the lower income before taxes
