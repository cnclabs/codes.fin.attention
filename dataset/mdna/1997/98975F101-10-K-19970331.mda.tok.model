item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview from the company s inception in through  the company derived the substantial majority of its revenue from dfps and vsps used principally in military  industrial and medical applications 
in  the company repositioned its business to develop and market integrated circuits designed to compress video and audio data for commercial and consumer applications in evolving multimedia markets 
at that time  the company discontinued development of dfp and vsp products  and in mid  the company advised its customers that it was discontinuing production of these products 
end of life sales of dfp and vsp products contributed substantially to revenues and operating income during the first quarter of  while sales of these products declined during the balance of and in dfp and vsp products are not expected to contribute significant revenues in future periods 
the company s current lines of multimedia compression products include jpeg based products used in video editing systems and filmless digital cameras  mpeg based products used in video playback and dolby digital based audio products used in movie and home theater systems and dvd players which have been recently introduced by manufacturers 
in december  the company acquired compcore  a designer of cores for video and audio decoder integrated circuits and a provider of software based compression products 
zoran issued approximately million shares of zoran common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of compcore 
zoran also assumed all outstanding options to purchase compcore common stock which were exchanged for options to purchase approximately  shares of zoran common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and the financial statements of the company and the information herein have been restated to include the results of compcore for all periods 
no significant adjustments were required to conform the accounting policies of zoran and compcore 
historically  average selling prices asps in the semiconductor industry in general  and for the company s products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
although asps have fluctuated substantially during the past three years  these fluctuations have been driven principally by changes in customer mix oem sales versus sales to distributors and the transition from low volume test sales to high volume production sales rather than by factors related to product life cycles 
during  the company experienced pricing pressure on certain of its first generation multimedia products which adversely affected asps 
the company believes that  as its multimedia product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  it is likely to experience further declines in the asps of its multimedia products  although the timing and amount of such future changes cannot be predicted with any certainty 
there can be no assurance that costs will decrease at the same rate as such declines in asps  or at all 
the company sells its products  either directly or through distributors or independent sales representatives  to oems worldwide 
sales prices to distributors are generally lower than prices for direct sales  as distributors are responsible for certain sales and marketing expenses  customer support and training 
lower gross margins on sales to distributors are partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to such sales 
sales in japan are primarily made through fujifilm  the company s strategic partner and distributor in japan 
fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than zoran s other distributors 
zoran has historically generated a significant percentage of its total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
these development contracts have provided the company with partial funding for the development of certain of its products 
payments received by the company under these development contracts are recorded as development revenue 
the company classifies all development costs  including costs related to these development contracts  as research and development expenses 
the company retains ownership of the intellectual property developed by it under these development contracts 
while the company intends to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners  it expects development revenue to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
the company is a party to certain research and development agreements with the chief scientist and birdf  which fund up to of incurred project costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums 
these agreements require the company to use its best efforts to achieve specified results and require the company to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales  and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
the company conducts research and development and certain sales and marketing and administrative operations in israel through its wholly owned israeli subsidiary 
as a result  certain expenses are incurred in israeli shekels 
until may  substantially all of the company s product sales were made from the company s us facility 
in may  the company restructured its manufacturing and sales organizations and began selling a portion of its products directly from its facility in israel 
to date  substantially all of the company s product sales and its development and licensing revenue have been denominated in us dollars and most costs of product sales have been incurred in us dollars 
the company expects that most of its sales and costs of sales will continue to be denominated and incurred in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
the company has not experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce its exposure to such fluctuations 
the company intends to actively monitor its foreign exchange exposure and to take appropriate action to reduce its foreign exchange risk  if such risk becomes material 
in october  the company contributed technology relating to its ghost cancellation products to a newly formed company the joint venture and to the joint venture s subsidiary  oren semiconductor  ltd 
oren  and an unrelated third party contributed cash  each in exchange for a equity interest in the joint venture 
since the organization of the joint venture  efforts relating to the development and marketing of ghost cancellation products have been conducted by the joint venture  through oren 
in september  the company approved the transfer of its interest in the joint venture  and  in cash  to gc holdings corporation holdings  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  as holdings initial capital and declared a dividend to its stockholders of all of its stock in holdings

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
product sales consist primarily of revenues from sales of the company s integrated circuits 
product sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increases in product sales resulted primarily from continued growth in unit sales of the company s dolby digital audio decoders  which are used in home audio equipment and dvd players 
although sales of these products increased substantially from  there have been delays in the development of the dvd market and there is still uncertainty regarding the timing of volume production and shipping of dvd players 
in addition  unit sales of the company s jpeg devices increased in compared to this increase reflected development of the markets for video editing and digital filmless cameras  although the market for consumer oriented video editing equipment has developed more slowly than had been anticipated 
unit sales increases in these product lines were partially offset by lower asps due to volume pricing and a higher proportion of sales to fujifilm 
product sales for also reflected revenue from an advance payment deferred in prior periods and recognized in the third quarter of upon the completion of a multi year sales program with one of the company s strategic partners 
sales to fujifilm  the company s strategic partner and distributor in japan  as well as an oem customer  accounted for of the company s product sales in  compared to in the company s next two largest customers accounted for an aggregate of of the company s product sales in  compared to in development and licensing revenue consists primarily of revenue from hardware design contracts that provide for license and milestone payments to be made at specified times  and license and royalty revenues generated primarily from the license of audio and video decoder software 
license and royalty agreements generally provide for the license of software for a specified period of time for either a single fee or a fee based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
development and licensing revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of  due primarily to an increase in the number of contracts under which compcore earns license and royalty revenue 
product gross profit 
product gross profit consists of product sales less cost of product sales 
cost of product sales consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
product gross margin was in compared to in the company s product gross margin is dependent on product mix and on the percentage of products sold directly to the company s oem customers versus indirectly through its marketing partners who purchase the company s products at lower prices but absorb most of the associated marketing and sales support expenses 
the decrease in product gross margin from was primarily due to higher volume sales of relatively lower priced  lower margin dolby digital based products and certain jpeg based products sold to fujifilm  the company s strategic partner  customer and distributor in japan 
the decrease in product gross margin in was partially offset by revenues recognized upon completion of the multi year contract with a strategic partner 
without the benefit of these revenues  product gross margin for would have been 
product gross margin in was also positively impacted by sales of high margin  end of life dfp and vsp products  primarily in the first quarter 
the company expects product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future quarters  causing further fluctuations in margins 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in r d expenses was the result of planned growth in development activities and development capabilities of both zoran and compcore 
r d expenses were net of reimbursements in the amounts of  and  in and  respectively  under product development agreements with the chief scientist 
r d expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in the company continues to believe that significant investments in r d are required for it to remain competitive  and anticipates that such expenses in terms of absolute dollars will increase in future periods  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  royalties  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in sg a expenses was due primarily to increased sales and marketing expenses to support increased sales levels  increased royalties related to higher product sales and increased administrative expenses associated with zoran s status as a publicly traded company 
sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in the company expects that sg a expenses will continue to increase in order to support the growth of the company 
merger and related expenses 
total costs and expenses in include non recurring merger and related expenses of million 
these expenses related to the merger of zoran and compcore in december and include professional fees  other direct transaction costs and other merger related costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies 
operating income loss 
the company s operating income increased to million in from million in excluding the non recurring merger and related expenses  the company s operating income for would have been million 
interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other income and expense resulted in net other income of million in compared to net other expense of  in interest expense decreased due to the use of proceeds from the initial public stock offering of the company s common stock the ipo in december to repay debt 
interest income increased due to the investment of the ipo proceeds  including proceeds from the january exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to  for from  for the company s tax provision for primarily reflects foreign withholding taxes  income taxes on compcore s earnings and alternative minimum tax on zoran s domestic earnings 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
product sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
jpeg based product sales increased reflecting an increase in unit sales volume and a increase in asps  which resulted from an increase in the proportion of sales made directly to oems as opposed to distributors and a shift in product mix toward higher priced chip sets with greater functionality 
during  sales to fujifilm  the company s principal distributor  accounted for of the company s jpeg based product sales 
the company made no sales of jpeg based products to fujifilm in sales of mpeg based products  which the company began shipping in the third quarter of  increased in as a result of an increase in unit sales volume 
unit sales of audio products increased substantially in as the company expanded and improved its audio product line  dolby digital gained increased acceptance as an audio compression standard and the company s customers moved from the development to the production phase 
audio product asps decreased in due to volume pricing and an increase in the proportion of sales made directly to fujifilm 
overall  sales to fujifilm accounted for of the company s total revenues in  including of product sales and of development and license revenue  compared to of total revenues in  including of product sales and of development and license revenue 
sales of the company s discontinued dfp and vsp product lines were million in  most of which occurred in the first quarter  compared to million in  approximately half of which occurred in the fourth quarter  as a result of end of life announcements with respect to these products resulting in volume shipments 
development and licensing revenue was million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to growth in the number of development contracts to modify and integrate compcore s mpeg technology for specific applications and an increase in the number of contracts under which compcore earns license and royalty revenue 
product gross profit 
product gross profit increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
product gross margin improved to in from in the improved product gross margin in resulted primarily from increased asps for jpeg based products  relatively stable overhead costs applied to substantially higher production volumes  manufacturing yield improvements  continued cost reductions resulting from volume purchases by the company and increased high margin end of life sales of the company s discontinued dfp and vsp products 
research and development 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in r d expenses was primarily due to the addition of personnel in connection with compcore s development of its mpeg technology as well as the enhancement of its existing mpeg technology 
this increase was partially offset by personnel reductions related to the transfer of zoran r d personnel to oren and a decrease in the number of manufacturing engineers as zoran increased its reliance on independent contractors to perform manufacturing  engineering and testing 
r d expenses were net of reimbursements in the amounts of  and  in and  respectively  under product development agreements with the chief scientist 
r d expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in sg a expenses was due primarily to increased commissions and royalties related to higher product sales 
employee related expenses also increased in as the company expanded its infrastructure to support increased sales 
sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other expense decreased to  in from  in  due to interest income earned on the investment of the proceeds from warrant exercises in october and the ipo in december which more than offset increased interest expense related to increased borrowings earlier in the year 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to  in from  in the income tax provision for resulted from income taxes on compcore s earnings  alternative minimum tax on the zoran s distribution of its stock in holdings to zoran s stockholders and on its domestic earnings and foreign withholding taxes of both companies 
the income tax provision for resulted from income taxes on compcore s earnings 
liquidity and capital resources until the ipo in december  the company had financed its operations primarily through private placements of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  borrowings from banks and its stockholders 
prior to the ipo  net proceeds from the sale of the company s equity securities aggregated million 
net proceeds from the ipo and the exercise of certain warrants in connection with the ipo totaled million 
in january  the company s underwriters exercised their over allotment option resulting in additional ipo related proceeds of million 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million of working capital 
the company s operating activities used cash of million in and provided cash of million in and million in cash used in operating activities for primarily reflected net losses  partially offset by depreciation and amortization and changes to working capital 
cash provided by operating activities in and reflected net income and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by cash used for working capital 
the company s capital expenditures totaled  in   in and million in capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
the company repaid its short term bank borrowings of million in december and its long term bank debt of  in with the proceeds of the ipo and  as of december   had no bank debt 
in july  compcore borrowed million from an individual and issued a convertible promissory note in such amount 
under the terms of the note  the entire principal balance and all accrued interest was converted into common stock upon the consummation of the compcore acquisition 
the company believes that its current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with existing sources of liquidity and anticipated cash flow from operations  will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital and capital equipment requirements through future performance and risk factors the company s future business  operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
product concentration  evolving markets 
to date  only a limited number of commercial and consumer products that incorporate the company s integrated circuits are in volume production 
current applications for the company s products include professional and consumer video editing systems  pc based and stand alone video cd and dvd players  digital audio systems  filmless digital cameras and video conferencing systems 
during and  the company derived a majority of its product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for video editing applications 
sales of audio products accounted for an increased percentage of product sales in the company expects that video editing and digital audio applications will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues for the near future 
over the longer term  the company s ability to generate increased revenues will be dependent on the expansion of sales of its products for use in other existing applications  as well as the development and acceptance of new applications for the company s technologies and products 
the potential size of the markets for new applications and the timing of their development and acceptance is uncertain 
the company s future success will depend upon whether manufacturers select the company s integrated circuits and software for incorporation into their products  and upon the successful marketing of these products by the manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that demand for existing applications will be sustained  that new markets will develop or that manufacturers developing products for any of these markets will design the company s integrated circuits into their products or successfully market them 
the failure of existing and new markets to develop or to be receptive to the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the emergence of markets for the company s integrated circuits will be affected by a variety of factors beyond the company s control 
in particular  the company s products are designed to conform with certain current industry standards 
there can be no assurance that manufacturers will continue to follow these standards or that competing standards will not emerge which will be preferred by manufacturers 
the emergence of markets for the company s products is also dependent in part upon third party content providers developing and marketing content for end user systems  such as video and audio playback systems  in a format compatible with the company s products 
there can be no assurance that these or other factors beyond the company s control will not adversely affect the development of markets for the company s products 
see item business strategy and business markets and applications 
reliance on independent foundries and contractors 
the company does not operate any manufacturing facilities  and from time to time shortages of foundry capacity develop for certain process technologies in the semiconductor industry 
the company currently relies on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of its products 
the company s independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
the company does not have a long term supply contract with either tsmc or motorola  its principal suppliers  and  therefore  neither tsmc nor motorola is obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
see item business manufacturing 
the company s reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the inability to obtain adequate capacity  the unavailability of or interruption in access to certain process technologies  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and cost  and potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property 
the company obtains foundry capacity through forecasts that are generated in advance of expected delivery dates and places its purchase orders up to three months prior to scheduled delivery 
the company s ability to obtain the foundry capacity necessary to meet the future demand for its products is based in part on its ability to accurately forecast future demand 
due to periodic limitations on semiconductor foundry capacity  if the company fails to accurately forecast its future demand  the company may be unable to obtain adequate supplies of integrated circuits on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accurately forecast the future demand for its products or obtain sufficient foundry capacity in the future 
in addition  the company s obligation to place purchase orders in advance of delivery subjects the company to inventory risks  including the risk of obsolescence 
while the company has not experienced any material disruptions in supply to date  there can be no assurance that manufacturing problems will not occur in the future 
in the event that any of the company s foundries are unable or unwilling to produce sufficient supplies of the company s products  in required volumes at acceptable costs  the company will be required to reallocate production among its other existing foundries or to identify and qualify acceptable alternative foundries 
this qualification process could take six months or longer  and no assurance can be given that any additional source would become available to the company or would be in a position to satisfy the company s production requirements on a timely basis 
the loss of any of the company s foundries as a supplier  the inability of the company in a period of increased demand for its products to expand supply or the company s inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from its current or future suppliers could reduce or delay shipments of the company s products 
any of these developments could damage relationships with the company s current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
all of the company s semiconductor products are currently being assembled by one of two independent contractors  asat and anam  and tested by those contractors or other independent contractors 
see item business manufacturing 
the company s reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits its control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the provision of services by the company s assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of the company s products 
these constraints or delays could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
new product development and timely introduction of new and enhanced products 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the company expects to increase its expenses relating to product development  and its future success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced products that meet changing customer requirements and industry standards 
the development and introduction of new semiconductor products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends  the successful and timely completion of product development  the ability of the company to convince its customers to incorporate the company s products into the design of their own products  the securing of sufficient foundry capacity and the achievement of acceptable wafer yields by the company s independent foundries 
development of new product designs can often require significant expenditures by the company  which expenditures may precede volume sales of the new product  if any  by a year or more 
in addition  software products as complex as those offered by the company typically contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop  introduce or manage the transition to new products 
future delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of such products to gain market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see item business industry background and business research and development 
competition  pricing pressures 
the company s existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining asps and rapid product obsolescence 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will continue to compete favorably or that the company will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing or new competitors 
in addition  increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see item business competition 
customer concentration  changes in customer mix 
the company s largest customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of its revenues  and sales to these large customers have varied materially from year to year 
see item business customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key customers or that such customers will not cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases 
in addition  sales to these key customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
any development that would result in a substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more key customers  including actions by competitors or technological changes  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
in addition  any development that would affect the collectibility of account balances from one or more key customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
potential fluctuations in operating results  net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products and products of its customers  the timing of large customer orders  the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products sold  and competitive pricing pressures 
the company expects that its operating results will fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including the availability of adequate foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  the emergence of new industry standards  product obsolescence  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating the company s integrated circuits and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
the company s operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where the company or its customers do business  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  a downturn in the markets for its customer s products  particularly the consumer electronics market  or order cancellations or reschedulings 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast  and these or other factors could materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
the company places orders to purchase its products from independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from its customers 
if anticipated shipments or development revenue in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high 
a significant portion of the company s expenses is relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on the company s forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet the company s expectations it may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
to date  the company s operating results have not been materially affected by seasonal factors 
however  as markets for consumer products incorporating the company s integrated circuits mature  the company expects that sales will tend to be stronger during the last several months of the calendar year than at other times due to increased demand for consumer products during the holiday season 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating results and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenues or net income from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
the company s future net income and cash flow will also be affected by its ability to apply its net operating losses nols  which totaled approximately million and  for federal and state tax reporting purposes as of december   against taxable income in future periods 
under the tax reform act of  the utilization of nols may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including a cumulative ownership change of greater than over a three year period 
the consummation of the ipo in december resulted in a cumulative ownership change of greater than 
accordingly  the company s nols incurred prior to the consummation of the ipo that can be utilized to reduce future taxable income for federal tax purposes will be limited to approximately million per year 
the company does not believe that its acquisition of compcore in december adversely affected its ability to utilize its nols 
however  future changes of ownership could further limit the company s utilization of nols and could have an adverse effect on the company s net income and cash flow 
upon utilization of israeli nols  the company s israeli subsidiary will benefit from its status as an approved enterprise pursuant to the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments   as amended 
there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws in the united states or israel or in the company s status will not limit the company s ability to utilize its nols or its approved enterprise status 
any limitation on the company s ability to utilize its nols or its approved enterprise status could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
risks associated with customer funded research and development 
the company historically has generated a significant percentage of its total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
these development contracts have provided the company with partial funding for the development of certain of its products 
under these contracts  the company receives payments upon reaching certain development milestones 
see item business research and development 
the company intends to continue to enter into development contracts with strategic partners  although it expects development revenue to remain relatively constant or decrease  and to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
the company s failure to achieve the milestones specified in its existing development contracts  the termination of existing contracts or the company s inability to secure future development contracts could have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
possible transactions to obtain additional foundry capacity 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  the company has considered and will continue to consider various transactions  which could include  among other things  equity investments from  option payments or other prepayments to  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity  contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods or joint ventures or other partnership relationships with foundries 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all or that such arrangements  if any  will be on terms favorable to the company 
if the company were not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  its business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
see item business manufacturing 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding 
the company may require substantial additional capital to finance its future growth  secure additional foundry capacity and fund its ongoing research and development activities beyond the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  acceptance of and demand for the company s products  the types of arrangements that the company may enter into with its independent foundries and the extent to which the company invests in new technology and research and development projects 
to the extent that the company s existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund the company s activities  the company may need to raise additional funds 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the company s stockholders would be reduced 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the company s common stock 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  it will be available on terms favorable to the company 
management of growth 
the company has recently experienced rapid growth and expansion which has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on its administrative  operational and financial resources and has resulted  and will continue to result  in a continuing increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company anticipates that future growth  if any  will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
the company s ability to manage its growth successfully will also require the company to continue to expand and improve its administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of the company s key operations  including its principal research and development operations and a significant portion of its sales and administrative operations  are located in israel  while a majority of its sales and marketing and certain of its administrative personnel  including its president and chief executive officer  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations is likely to place additional strain on the company s resources and its ability to effectively manage its growth 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on intellectual property  licensed products  risk of disputes and litigation 
the company s ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon its ability to protect its proprietary technology and information 
although the company relies on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements to protect certain of its intellectual property  the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel and the success of its ongoing product development efforts are more important in maintaining its competitive position 
the company generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with its employees  distributors  customers and potential customers and limits access to its proprietary information 
the company currently holds several united states patents  and has additional patent applications pending  that pertain to technologies and processes relating to the company s current business 
there can be no assurance that the company s intellectual property rights  if challenged  will be upheld as valid  will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or will prevent the development of competitive products 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely in these countries 
the company sells its dolby digital based products under a perpetual  non exclusive license from dolby which permits the company to incorporate dolby s digital algorithm into its products 
the company s customers enter into license agreements with dolby pursuant to which they pay royalties directly to dolby
