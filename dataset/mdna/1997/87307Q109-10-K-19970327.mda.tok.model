during  the public sector and commercial business revenues remained relatively flat  compared to operating expenses  before depreciation and amortization  increased in by nearly million  or  over the increase in operating costs was the result of additional technical personnel  other direct contract costs and higher marketing and development costs that were incurred in pursuit of new commercial business opportunities that did not materialize as anticipated 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  in increased million  or  over mainly due to the need for additional technical personnel and marketing and development costs

the increases in both periods were the result of office expansions and infrastructure equipment purchased to support the increase in technical personnel 
spacecom revenues generated by spacecom during were million  compared to million in and million in the increase in revenues in of million  or  over and in of million  or  over were both attributable principally to increased demand for channel space from spacecom s existing paging customers

in  spacecom ventured into the direct to home market with directcom and incurred  in operating expenses 
directcom s operations were terminated in the fourth quarter of the increase in operating expenses  before depreciation and amortization  of million  or  in over resulted primarily due to the expenses incurred by directcom and increased transmission expenses as spacecom broadened its product offering

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations continues to be the company s primary source of funds to finance operating needs  capital expenditures and investments 
in  net cash flows from operating activities were million million after distributions to minority interests  reflecting the continued growth of the company s after tax earnings 
this cash  plus existing cash resources  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and borrowing by ssds of million  were used to fund the company s additional investment in marketable securities of million  capital expenditures of million and the reduction in the company s capitalized lease obligations of million during at december   the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregated million  an increase of million over that as of december  the above total includes million of cash and cash equivalents held by sng  in which the company has a ownership interest 
the company has invested the majority of its cash available for current operations in investment grade municipal governmental obligations 
as of december   approximately million of such securities had maturities greater than days and were classified as available for sale marketable securities 
the company s policy pertaining to the temporary investment of cash available for operations currently prohibits exposure to interest rate fluctuations to periods in excess of months 
the company has a credit agreement with a bank under which  subject to certain conditions  the bank has agreed to lend up to million on a revolving basis through march   at which time the outstanding balance  if any  will convert to a five year term amortizing loan 
borrowings under this facility are guaranteed by the company s subsidiaries  excluding ssds  and bear interest at the bank s designated prime rate  the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin or the certificate of deposit rate plus a margin 
at december    in letters of credit and no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
the company currently does not intend to renew this credit facility  but is considering entering into an expanded credit facility during in addition  ssds has a revolving credit facility with a bank which provides for borrowings up to of billed trade receivables of ssds less than days past due  subject to certain conditions  and which expires april  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at the bank s designated prime rate plus a margin 
this credit facility  which was entered into subsequent to december   replaced the previously existing unsecured credit facility under which million was outstanding at december  management believes it is possible ssds will need to increase the borrowing level under the credit facility or obtain additional financing or capital to support its operations during and will likely have to renegotiate certain financial covenant ratios to remain in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
the company collects annually  in advance  a majority of its sng subscription fees and certain of its uvtv superstation and prevue networks revenues 
as of december   the unearned portion of all prepayments totaled million  of which approximately million  or  was attributable to sng 
aggregate unearned prepayments increased by million during the year ended december   of which million was attributable to the customer prepayments associated with netlink s operations  which were combined with those of superstar effective april  in sng 
sng generally offers a refund of unearned prepayments at the customer s option if service is discontinued for any reason 
in the case of uvtv and prevue networks  the company s liability is limited to a refund of unearned prepayments in the event that the company is unable to provide service 
no material refunds have been paid to date 
under the terms of the capital leases for two satellite transponders placed in service by uvtv and prevue networks in  the company was obligated for net minimum lease payments aggregating million as of december   a reduction of million  or  from the obligation existing at the prior year s end 
the company expects to further reduce the lease obligation during by approximately million 
the company also leases various other satellite transponders accounted for as operating leases 
these operating leases accounted for approximately million in operating expenses  net of sublease revenue  during capital expenditures during of million were principally attributable to the purchase of control units provided to the company s cable television customers and to data processing equipment and furniture  fixtures and facilities used by the company 
in connection with development of its prevue interactive technology and in defending itself against certain patent infringement claims by starsight  the company made expenditures during totaling approximately million million related to the starsight litigation and estimates that its total expenditures during will aggregate approximately million 
these expenditures for are expected to relate primarily to i continued market testing of the company s interactive technology  ii on going software development which will make the company s interactive technology compatible with new set top converters  iii the launch of prevue interactive services to programming distributor s systems that acquire and install new set top converters  and iv continued patent litigation 
the company anticipates that substantially all of the anticipated expenditures will be expensed as incurred and will be funded by working capital and cash generated by operations and from the company s other available capital resources 
at the present time  the company is unable to estimate the amount of funds that will be necessary to implement its plan for the development of its interactive technology or to develop additional applications for such technology  as much depends on the pace of technological developments  the response of cable television systems and their subscribers to initial interactive services and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company believes  except as discussed above for ssds  that currently available cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash flow generated from operations  will provide the resources necessary to meet its working capital and related financing needs for the foreseeable future and to pursue opportunities to expand its businesses 
the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase from time to time up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s class a common stock using existing cash resources 
no shares of stock were repurchased during  however  through march   the company had repurchased  shares of stock 
the company announced in december that the board of directors had authorized management to pursue a potential spin off of the company s interest in sng 
the potential spin off is contingent on  among other matters  the company obtaining a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service 
recently announced consolidations in the dbs industry and complex tax matters may impact the company s strategy with respect to the spin off 
the company continues to explore opportunities to expand the market shares of its existing businesses  develop new products and acquire interests in new businesses
