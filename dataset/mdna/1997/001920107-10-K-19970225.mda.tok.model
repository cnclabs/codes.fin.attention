item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview the company manufactures and markets intermediate chemicals and specialty products  operating in a single industry segment 
it conducts business primarily in the americas  europe  and the asia pacific region 
each of the company s two principal manufacturing processes yields its key product  propylene oxide po  and one of two co products  styrene monomer sm or tertiary butyl alcohol tba 
the company also manufactures numerous derivatives of po and tba 
among these are polyols  a key derivative of po  and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  a principal derivative of tba 
mtbe is used in oxygenated fuels and as an octane additive 
on december   the company purchased substantially all of the assets of olin corporation s olin toluene diisocyanate tdi and aliphatic diisocyanate adi businesses 
the purchase included olin s tdi and adi production facilities at lake charles  louisiana  and certain related assets  including trademarks  patents and technology 
tdi and polyols are combined in the manufacture of polyurethanes 
on september   the company sold its plastics business to nova chemicals inc nova 
as a result of the sale of the plastics business  the company no longer manufactures or sells sm derivatives  but will continue to manufacture and market sm 
net income for was million compared with million in and million in net income in decreased versus primarily due to significantly lower sm margins and  to a lesser extent  lower po and derivatives volumes and lower mtbe margins 
net income for increased over primarily due to improved margins for po and derivatives and a significant improvement in sm margins 
results of operations product volumes sales and other operating revenues include the sales and processing volumes of po  tba  sm and their derivatives as set forth below for the years indicated 
as a result of the sale of the plastics business on september   the company no longer manufactures or sells sm derivatives  but will continue to manufacture and market sm 
year ended december  millions po and derivatives pounds    co products sm and derivatives pounds    tba and derivatives gallons    the reported sm volumes include quantities processed for po sm ii equity partners sm equity volumes under long term processing arrangements 
the sm equity volumes were million  million and million pounds in  and  respectively 
revenues revenues decreased eight percent to  million in from  million in primarily reflecting lower sm prices and  to a lesser extent  lower volumes for po and derivatives 
sm sales prices decreased significantly versus the period as increased industry capacity depressed sm market prices 
for example  based on domestic market quotations  average sm contract and spot prices decreased more than percent and percent  respectively  versus sm capacity increases are expected to continue to impact sm prices and margins in the near term 
po and derivatives volumes in decreased four percent compared to due to increased availability of po supplies in and slower growth in demand 
po industry capacity increased in  following the addition of a new competitive facility in  which operated at reduced rates in  and a significant competitor s debottleneck in conversely  the company estimates that worldwide market demand for po  in and  slowed to less than half of its historical five percent long term annual rate of growth 
sm and derivatives volumes increased three percent  primarily due to increased sm equity volumes  as noted above 
revenues increased percent to  million in from  million in primarily due to higher sales prices 
while sales prices were generally higher for all products  average sm sales prices increased significantly versus the period as a result of higher worldwide demand during the early part of volume benefits from higher domestic mtbe volumes and first time sales of tdi were substantially offset by lower volumes for po and derivatives 
domestic mtbe volumes increased versus primarily due to increased demand  which resulted from implementation of the reformulated gasoline phase of the clean air act in po and derivatives volumes in decreased six percent compared to primarily due to the addition of a new competitive facility in the us in late  as well as lower asia pacific sales  which were affected by a slowdown in china markets 
gross profit gross profit decreased percent to million in from  million in the gross profit decrease was primarily attributable to lower sm margins and  to a lesser extent  lower po and derivatives volumes and lower mtbe margins 
these were partly offset by higher po and derivatives margins 
overall gross profit was percent of sales in compared to percent in sm margins were significantly lower versus as prices decreased substantially more than raw material costs 
mtbe margins primarily decreased due to increases in feedstock and other costs as mtbe prices were relatively flat year to year 
gross profit increased percent to  million in from million in  reflecting the percent increase in revenues as well as higher margins 
overall gross profit was percent of sales in compared to percent in as higher sales prices more than offset net increases in raw materials costs 
the margin improvements were seen in po and derivatives  especially in the fourth quarter  and in sm margins during the first half of the year 
average sm margins improved significantly in as evidenced by industry raw material margins  which doubled  on average  compared to sm prices and margins increased substantially during the first half of  but declined over the second half as worldwide demand declined 
raw material cost comparisons  versus  were mixed  with substantial increases in average propylene costs  more moderate increases in average butane and ethylene costs and a decrease in average benzene and methanol costs 
the company entered into a number of multi year  fixed margin mtbe toll based sales contracts covering a substantial portion of the company s us based mtbe volume 
those contracts have had the effect of reducing the exposure of the mtbe business to market cycles 
a significant number of those contracts have terminated  while the remainder will terminate in early the company is in the process of negotiating new contracts 
in view of current market conditions  however  it is anticipated that the pricing in the new contracts will provide margins that are less favorable than those provided in the former contracts 
other in  management adopted a corporate restructuring program  resulting in a pretax charge of million  primarily for costs associated with personnel reductions 
this item was reported as restructuring costs in other income expense  net  was million in  million in and million in the increase in primarily reflects benefits from insurance proceeds and higher interest income  partly offset by lower equity earnings from the company s po sm joint venture in japan 
the period included higher equity earnings from the japanese joint venture  while included an million pretax benefit from an insurance settlement related to the channelview plant incident 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was percent in  percent in  and percent in the decrease in the rate versus is due to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards  utilization of foreign tax credits pursuant to the tax sharing agreement with arco  and lower state income taxes in the decrease in versus reflected benefits from higher export income and increased utilization of foreign tax credits due to higher foreign earnings 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments compared with million at december  the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  shows that net cash flows provided by operating activities were million  whereas net cash flows used by investment and financing activities were million and million  respectively 
on december   the company purchased substantially all of the assets of olin s tdi and adi businesses for approximately million 
the purchase included olin s tdi and adi production facilities at lake charles  louisiana  working capital of approximately million and certain related assets  including trademarks  patents and technology 
the company financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowing 
investment activities in included expenditures for plant and equipment  excluding the olin acquisition  of million 
a significant portion of the capital program was devoted to environmental  health and safety projects as well as po derivative capacity expansions at existing facilities 
minority interest includes equity contributions designated for specific capital projects 
at december   the unexpended amounts were classified as long term other assets in the balance sheet 
the company s capital budget for plant and equipment is million 
on october   the company announced the start of engineering on a million pound per year butanediol bdo plant to be built in rotterdam  the netherlands  by the year  and plans to expand existing bdo capacity in channelview  texas  from million to million pounds per year in late on september   the company sold its plastics business to nova 
the sale proceeds were approximately million 
as part of the transaction  the company entered into a long term sales agreement to supply nova with approximately the same amount of sm as had been consumed by the plastics business 
the sale of the plastics business did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the sale of the plastics business  the company implemented a stock repurchase program for up to  shares of the company s common stock held in certain employee benefit plans by former employees associated with the plastics business 
through december   the company repurchased  shares 
on april   the board of directors gave final approval for the expansion of the po sm complex in channelview  texas  and the construction of a new world scale po sm plant in rotterdam  the netherlands 
the channelview po sm expansion will add annual po and sm capacity of million and million pounds  respectively  in early the new po sm plant is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter  adding annual po and sm capacity of million and  million pounds  respectively  upon start up 
the company plans to finance portions of the channelview po sm expansion and the new rotterdam po sm plant through limited partners who will have a minority equity interest in the completed facilities 
the company also plans to commit substantial portions of the increased sm capacity from these projects  as well as additional sm capacity at existing po sm facilities  under long term processing arrangements 
the company paid dividends totalling million in  including a 
per share dividend  totalling million  during the quarter ended december  on january   the board of directors declared a dividend of 
per share on the company s common stock  payable march  the company maintains a credit agreement under which it can borrow amounts of up to million 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings against the credit agreement  which is used to back up the company s commercial paper borrowing 
it is expected that future cash requirements for capital expenditures  dividends and debt repayments will be met by cash generated from operating activities and additional borrowing 
effects of inflation based on the age of the company s fixed assets  it is estimated that the replacement cost of those assets is greater than the historical cost reflected in the company s financial statements 
accordingly  the company s depreciation and amortization expense for the three years ended december   would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 
risk management the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce certain types of financial risk 
use of derivatives is limited to simple  non leveraged instruments placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is monitored 
company policy provides restrictions on concentrating credit risk in any one institution 
hedging strategies and transactions are reviewed and approved by management before being implemented 
monthly market valuations and quarterly sensitivity analyses are performed to monitor the effectiveness of the company s risk management program 
the company enters into the following activities using derivative financial instruments foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts and swap contracts to reduce the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows  and  to a lesser extent  interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the company s outstanding floating rate debt 
feedstock costs see raw materials included in items and environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
these contingencies include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the past disposal or release of certain chemical substances at various sites remediation costs 
the company continues to evaluate the amount of these remediation costs and periodically adjusts its reserve for remediation costs and its estimate of additional environmental loss contingencies based on progress made in determining the magnitude  method and timing of the remedial actions that may be required by government authorities and an evaluation of the company s potential liability in relation to the liability and financial resources of any other potentially responsible parties 
reflected in costs and other operating expenses for is a million pretax charge for estimated future remediation costs compared with million in and million in these charges do not reflect any potential benefit from insurance proceeds 
at december   the company s environmental reserve totaled million  which reflected the company s latest assessment of potential future remediation costs associated with existing sites 
a significant portion of the reserve is related to the beaver valley plant site  located in monaca  pennsylvania 
the reserve gives recognition to a work plan  between the company and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep  for testing  risk assessment  remedial process design and remediation of conditions at the beaver valley plant 
the reserve also reflects an agreement between the company and another responsible party whereby that party has agreed to pay for approximately percent of the costs associated with the beaver valley plant work plan 
the company sold the beaver valley plant assets to nova as of september   see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  but currently retains ownership of the land at the beaver valley plant site  substantial portions of which are being leased to nova 
the company has retained responsibility for certain remediation of the land at the beaver valley plant site under the work plan and for certain additional remediation that may be required by padep pursuant to the pennsylvania land recycling and environmental remediation standards act 
the remainder of the reserve is related to four other plant sites and one federal superfund site for amounts ranging from million to million per site 
the company is involved in administrative proceedings or lawsuits relating to eight other superfund sites 
however  the company estimates  based on currently available information  that potential loss contingencies associated with these sites  individually and in the aggregate  are not significant 
substantially all amounts reserved are expected to be paid out over the next five to ten years 
the company relies upon remedial investigation feasibility studies ri fs at each site as a basis for estimating remediation costs at the site 
the company has completed ri fs or preliminary assessments at most of its sites 
however  selection of the remediation method and the cleanup standard to be applied are  in most cases  subject to approval by the appropriate government authority 
accordingly  the company may have possible loss contingencies in excess of the amounts reserved to the extent that the scope of remediation required  the final remediation method selected and the cleanup standard applied vary from the assumptions used in estimating the reserve 
the company estimates that the upper range of these possible loss contingencies should not exceed the amount accrued by more than million 
the extent of loss related to environmental matters ultimately depends upon a number of factors  including technological developments  changes in environmental laws  the number and ability to pay of other parties involved at a particular site and the company s potential involvement in additional environmental assessments and cleanups 
based upon currently known facts  management believes that any remediation costs the company may incur in excess of the amounts reserved or disclosed above would not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company and the other principal responsible party prp at the beaver valley site have reached an agreement with the us government whereby the government will pay percent of the costs incurred by the company and the prp for remediation of substantial portions of the beaver valley site 
the company has neither recorded an asset nor reduced any liability as of december  as a result of this agreement
