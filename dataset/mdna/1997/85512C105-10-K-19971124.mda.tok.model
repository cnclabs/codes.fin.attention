f represents net income per unit and cash distributions paid per unit for the period december  through september  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in analyzing the historical financial results of the star gas group and the financial results of the partnership  the following matters  should be considered 
following petro s initial investment in star gas in december  new management initiated significant restructuring efforts in order to focus and expand its operations in its most profitable geographic markets  the midwest and northeast 
these activities included star gas divestiture of its texas operation in august  the sale of its southern georgia operations in november  and the completion of six acquisitions totaling million gallons annually in its core midwest and northeast markets from june to july the results for fiscal do not include the operating results of the partnership s most recent acquisition  pearl gas co  which was completed on october  gross profit margins vary according to the customer mix 
for example  sales to certain customer groups  such as residential or commercial  generate higher gross profit margins than sales to other customer groups  such as agricultural customers 
accordingly  a change in customer mix can affect gross profit without necessarily impacting total sales 
because propane s primary use is for heating in residential and commercial buildings  weather conditions have a significant impact on the financial performance of the partnership 
management believes that despite year to year fluctuations  average temperatures have been relatively stable over time 
nevertheless  as reflected by the unusually warm weather in fiscal  actual yearly weather conditions can vary substantially from historical averages 
accordingly  in analyzing changes in financial performance  the weather conditions in which the partnership star gas group operated in any given period should be considered 
the following discussion reflects the results of operations and operating data of the predecessor company for the year ended september  and is compared to the combined results of the predecessor company for the period october  through december   and the results of the mlp from december  through september  and for the year ended september  the operating results of the predecessor company and the mlp for the year ended september  were combined to facilitate an analysis of the fundamental operating data 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  volume for the year ended september   retail propane volume declined million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to the effect on volume of warmer temperatures experienced during the second fiscal quarter compared to the prior year s second fiscal quarter and to customer conservation efforts attributable to significantly higher propane selling prices 
the partnership was able to mitigate the effects of the warmer temperatures on retail propane volume through both internal account growth and two acquisitions completed since march  also favorably impacting the year to year comparison was an increase in sales to agricultural customers  resulting from a return to more normal propane demand for grain drying 
sales for the year ended september   sales increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was due to higher selling prices in response to an industry wide significant increase in propane supply costs experienced during fiscal cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to higher per gallon propane supply costs 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the increase in gross profit resulted from higher per gallon margins across all market segments which was partially offset by the impact of slightly lower retail propane volume 
delivery and branch expenses delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the additional expenses associated with the first fiscal quarter s increase in agricultural volume  higher vehicle operating costs due to an increase in fuel costs and higher employee benefit expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal  due to the impact of two acquisitions completed since march   the amortization of certain deferred charges relating to the partnership s first mortgage notes and depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures made during fiscal and general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to million of one time expenses associated with the exploration of strategic alternatives designed to maximize unitholder value including  without limitation  the sale or merger of the partnership offset by lower acquisition related expenses 
on march   the partnership decided to terminate its efforts to seek a merger or possible sale of the partnership 
interest expense  net interest expense  net declined million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this reduction was primarily due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rate 
income tax expense income tax expense primarily represents certain state income taxes related to the partnership s wholly owned corporate subsidiary which conducts non qualifying master limited partnership business 
net income net income decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was attributable to the increase in operating expenses  million of one time costs associated with the exploration of strategic alternatives and million of depreciation and amortization which was partially offset by million increase in gross profit 
ebitda ebitda defined as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization less net gain loss on sales of businesses and equipment decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal excluding the one time expenses associated with the strategic alternative  ebitda increased million  or  to million due to improved per gallon margins across all market segments and growth in the customer base provided by both internal marketing and acquisition efforts 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  volume for the year ended september   retail propane volume increased or million gallons to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for the year ended september  excluding the divested southern georgia operations  which contributed million gallons in fiscal  retail propane volume increased or million gallons 
propane sold to residential and commercial customers increased or million gallons  due to colder temperatures  acquisitions and internal account growth 
based on degree days in areas in which the partnership operates  fiscal was colder than normal and colder than fiscal while the residential and commercial market segments were favorably impacted by the colder temperatures  sales to agricultural customers  who use propane predominately in the grain drying process  declined by approximately million gallons primarily due to the unusually dry crop harvest during the first fiscal quarter 
for fiscal  propane sold to wholesale customers was million gallons  virtually unchanged from the fiscal level 
sales sales increased or million  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal excluding the results attributable to the southern georgia operations  which contributed million of sales in fiscal  sales rose million or due to increased volume and higher retail and wholesale selling prices 
cost of sales cost of sales increased or million to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal while cost of sales declined by million due to the disposition of the southern georgia assets  cost of sales in the core midwest and northeast operations increased by million due to the increase in volume and higher per gallon wholesale propane costs 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the partnership was able to lower its cost of sales through the utilization of its underground storage facility  however  this benefit was offset during the second fiscal quarter by a rapid spike in wholesale propane costs 
gross profit gross profit increased or million  to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal excluding million of gross profit earned by the divested southern georgia operations in fiscal  gross profit increased or million and was attributable to the retail volume growth  improved wholesale gross profit margins and increased revenues from the sale  service and rental of appliances 
partially offsetting these positive influences on gross profit were the effects of the second quarter rise in wholesale propane costs and the decline in sales to lower margin agricultural customers 
on an overall basis  per gallon retail gross profit margins increased as a greater proportion of the partnership s sales were made to higher margin residential and commercial customers 
delivery and branch expenses delivery and branch expenses declined or million to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decline was due to the elimination of million of operating costs attributable to the southern georgia operations which was partially offset by an increase of million or in the remaining core operations 
the volume increase and the impact on operating costs of the severe winter weather experienced in the partnership s northeast markets were the primary factors for the million increase in operating costs in the core operations 
on a per gallon basis  operating costs in the midwest and northeast operations declined due to lower insurance expense  improved operating efficiencies and economies of scale achieved in connection with growing the partnership s customer base 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense declined million to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal primarily due to a reduction in these expenses due to the divestiture of the southern georgia operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased approximately million to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to million of non recurring expenses associated with certain professionals engaged by the partnership to assist management in analyzing and structuring two significant acquisition candidates 
net gain loss on sales of assets loss on sales of assets declined to million for fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal a loss of million was recorded in connection with the sale of the southern georgia operations 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  declined or million to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this reduction was primarily due to a decline in the weighted average long term borrowing rate and additional income generated on higher cash balances 
for further discussions concerning the partnership s debt structure 
see note of the consolidated financial statements of the partnership 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was approximately million 
this expense primarily represents certain state income taxes that the star gas group was required to pay 
subsequent to december   taxes on income will be borne by the partners and not the partnership  except for income taxes relating to the partnership s wholly owned corporate subsidiary which conducts non qualifying master limited partnership business 
net income net income increased million to million for fiscal as compared to a loss of million in fiscal the improvement was attributable to the increase in retail propane volume  the positive impact of divesting the southern georgia operations and lower non cash expenses  including the loss on sales of assets 
ebitda ebitda defined as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization less net gain loss of sale of businesses and equipment increased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this improvement in ebitda was the result of the volume increase associated with colder temperatures and growth in the partnership s customer base due to both acquisitions and internal marketing  partially offset by the impact of lower per gallon gross profit margins experienced during the second quarter of fiscal for continuing operations  delivery and branch expenses declined by  when measured on a per gallon basis  due to the impact of the cost reduction programs implemented over the past two years and the increase in volume 
also contributing to the growth in ebitda was the divestiture of the southern georgia operations  which reduced ebitda in the prior year by approximately million 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
liquidity and capital resources for fiscal  net cash flow provided by operating activities of million consisted of million of net income and million of depreciation and amortization  which was offset by a million increase in working capital and other changes 
inventories increased by million due to both an increase in propane gallons stored and higher per unit propane costs 
net accounts receivable increased by million due to an increase in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million for  as the proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of million were used to partially fund million of acquisitions and million of capital expenditures  including million of maintenance capital expenditures 
for fiscal  net cash flow provided by operating activities of million combined with million from the sale of certain fixed assets amounted to million 
these funds were utilized in investing activities to fund million of capital expenditures including million of maintenance capital expenditures  in financing activities to repay net credit facility borrowings of million and to pay partnership distributions of million 
as a result of the above activities  cash at september  declined by million to million  as compared to million on hand at the beginning of the period 
on october   the partnership completed the pearl gas acquisition 
the total cost of the acquisition gas was million which was paid cash including estimated working capital of million which is subject to adjustments and includes million of transactional expenses plus the issuance of limited and general partner interests in the partnership  including  common units issued to the general partner valued in total as of acquisition date at million 
the partnership funded the cash purchase price with million of available cash and million borrowed under the partnership s acquisition facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction 
based on its current cash position  bank credit availability and expected net cash flow from operating activities  the partnership expects to be able to meet all of its obligations for fiscal  as well as all of its other current obligations as they become due 
for fiscal  the partnership anticipates paying interest on its first mortgage notes and acquisition facility of million  anticipates paying limited and general partner distributions of million  and plans to purchase fixed assets of approximately million
