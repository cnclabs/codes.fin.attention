item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the company s capital requirements reflect the capital intensive nature of its business and are attributable principally to its construction program and the retirement of its outstanding debt 
the company relies on cash generated from operations and short term borrowings to meet normal working capital requirements and to temporarily finance capital expenditures 
during  the company s net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used by investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities were million  million and million  respectively 
on january   the board of directors increased the amount the company was authorized to borrow from various banks and trust companies from million to a ceiling of million 
as of december   the company had four unsecured bank lines of credit  each in the amount of  funds provided from these lines of credit are used for short term cash needs to meet seasonal working capital requirements and to fund portions of its capital expenditures 
the outstanding balances of short term borrowings at december  and were million and million  respectively 
based upon anticipated cash requirements in  the company may refinance the short term debt and provide capital requirements through the issuance of long term debt 
the timing of such an issuance is dependent upon the nature of the securities involved as well as current market and economic conditions 
in  the company used cash provided by operating activities coupled with short term borrowings to fund the capital expenditures and increases in working capital requirements 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to the significant increase in natural gas and propane prices during the fourth quarter of in  the company s capital additions were funded by operating activities 
in  cash provided by operations increased due to the collection of a large amount of underrecovered purchased gas costs present at the end of during  and  capital expenditures were approximately   and  respectively 
for  the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures 
this amount includes million for natural gas distribution  million for natural gas transmission  million for environmental related expenditures  million for propane distribution   for advanced information services and  for general plant 
the natural gas and propane distribution expenditures are for expansion and improvement of facilities in existing service territories 
natural gas transmission expenditures are for improvement of the pipeline system and completion of the delaware city compressor station 
the advanced information services expenditures are for computer hardware  software and related equipment 
financing for the construction program is expected to be provided from short term borrowings  cash from operations and from an issuance of long term debt 
the construction program is subject to continuous review and modification 
actual construction expenditures may vary from the above estimates due to a number of factors including inflation  changing economic conditions  regulation  load growth and the cost and availability of capital 
the company expects to incur environmental related expenditures during and in future years see note j to the consolidated financial statements  a portion of which may need to be financed through external sources 
management does not expect such financing to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or capital resources of the company 
capital structure as of december   common equity represented of permanent capitalization  compared to in and in the company remains committed to maintaining a sound capital structure and strong credit ratings in order to provide the financial flexibility needed to access the capital markets when required 
this commitment  along with adequate and timely rate relief for the company s regulated operations  helps to ensure that the company will be able to attract capital from outside sources at a reasonable cost 
the achievement of these objectives will provide benefits to customers and creditors  as well as to the company s investors 
financing activities on october   the company finalized a private placement of million of senior notes due in the company used the proceeds to retire  of the senior notes of eastern shore natural gas company  the company s natural gas transmission subsidiary eastern shore  originally due october  the remaining proceeds of  were used to repay short term borrowings under the company s lines of credit 
the company issued no long term debt in and during  the company repaid a total of approximately  of long term debt  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the company issued   and  shares of common stock in connection with its automatic dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan during the years of  and  respectively 
results of operations net income for was  as compared to  for exclusive of matters relating to the settlement and associated accruals described below  earnings in increased by  the net income reflected the settlement between eastern shore and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regarding eastern shore s purchased gas adjustment pga computation 
this settlement  which was a non recurring event  contributed  to net income due to the reversal of the excess liability for a potential refund previously recorded  and resulted in a reduction in the required level of accruals from  after tax in to  after tax in earnings before interest and taxes ebit for the years  and were million  million and million 
natural gas distribution the natural gas distribution segment contributed ebit of million in compared to million in both and the increase in ebit in was due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses 
gross margin in increased million due to a full year of rate increases  which went into effect in  coupled with a increase in deliveries to residential and commercial customers located in the company s northern service territory 
the rate increase became effective during december  for maryland operations and interim rates were in effect during june  for delaware operations 
the rate increases were designed to increase revenues  and  annually for the maryland and delaware operations  respectively 
the increase in deliveries to residential and commercial customers located in the company s northern service territory was related to temperatures which were colder than the previous year 
gross margin in increased million due to the partial year of rate increases for the maryland and delaware operations in and an increase of and in transportation and delivery volumes  respectively  by the florida distribution operations 
these increases in florida s volumes reflected sales to phosphate producing and citrus processing customers and to three co generation plants 
operations expenses for increased by  or after increasing by million or in over the increases related to compensation  benefits  data processing costs  uncollectibles and regulatory expenses 
the increases in related to compensation  data processing conversion costs  consulting  legal and regulatory expenses 
maintenance expenses were slightly less in compared to  when expenses were  or higher than expenses due to a greater level of maintenance on meter and regulating stations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to plant additions placed in service during the past two years 
other taxes increased by  or in  partially due to the inclusion of certain state revenue related taxes in natural gas transmission the natural gas transmission segment contributed ebit of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the large increase in ebit includes the effect of the settlement between eastern shore and the ferc regarding eastern shore s pga computation see note k to the consolidated financial statements 
the settlement  which was a non recurring event  contributed million to ebit for due to the reversal of excess liability for the potential refund previously recorded  and resulted in a reduction in the required level of accruals from million in to  in exclusive of matters relating to the settlement and associated accruals  ebit decreased million in  increased  in and increased million in the reduction in ebit of million was primarily the result of a decrease in gross margin on sales to industrial customers 
contributing to the increases in and ebit were increased gross margins  primarily attributable to increased deliveries of industrial sales volumes  offset slightly by higher operating expenses 
the decline in gross margin resulted from a decrease in volumes delivered  primarily reflecting decreased deliveries to two industrial interruptible customers  a municipal power plant and a methanol plant 
the methanol plant shut down operations on april  the management of the methanol plant has indicated that they would monitor methanol prices and would re evaluate their position as to reopening or permanently closing on or about april  to our knowledge  no decision has been made regarding reopening or permanently closing the methanol plant 
during  and  deliveries to methanol and power plants contributed to gross margin approximately  million and million  respectively 
these two customers are interruptible customers and have no ongoing commitment  contractual or otherwise  to purchase natural gas from the company see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
operations expense increased in  primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefit related expenses 
operations expense increased by  or in compared to the majority of the increases were in payroll  telemetering and legal fees 
maintenance expense declined slightly in after declining by  or in maintenance expenses in increased by  due to the painting of a pipeline bridge structure and a higher level of natural gas main maintenance 
depreciation expense increased in due to plant placed in service during the past two years 
on october   eastern shore filed with the ferc for a rate increase of approximately  this increase would be effective for only revenues earned on sales to regulated customers 
in connection with the ferc order relating to the settlement  eastern shore applied in december of to the ferc for a blanket certificate authorizing open access transportation service on its pipeline system 
the implementation of open access transportation service  expected to occur during  will provide all of eastern shore s customers with the opportunity to transport gas over its system at ferc regulated rates 
open access is thus likely to result in a shift of eastern shore s business from margins earned on sales of gas to large industrial customers to a possibly lower margin earned on transportation services 
after the implementation of open access  it is expected that eastern shore s earnings  which in the past have been driven to a substantial extent by widely varying levels of unregulated sales  will tend to be more stable and closer to a regulated return 
propane distribution the propane distribution segment contributed ebit of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in ebit was primarily the result of an increase in gross margin mostly offset by greater operating expenses 
the decrease in ebit was a combined impact of a decrease in gross margin coupled with greater operating expenses 
the increase in gross margin of million or for was primarily the result of a increase in sales volumes due to temperatures being colder than the previous year 
the decrease in gross margin of  for was primarily due to a decline in sales volume  partially offset by a higher average margin per gallon 
overall  temperatures in were colder than temperatures in  yet volumes were lower due to the timing and severity of weather conditions experienced in in  the segment did not secure a contract with one wholesale customer under which it had supplied large quantities of propane  contributing  to gross margin  in operations expense for increased by  or after increasing by  or in the increase in expenses for and occurred primarily in compensation  benefits and outside services 
maintenance expenses increased by  or in after reducing by  or in the maintenance expense increases occurred primarily on vehicles 
starting in  the company will be integrating the operations of tri county gas company  inc tri county  acquired on march   and the company s current propane distribution operations 
advanced information services the advanced information services segment contributed ebit of million  million and  for the years  and during  revenue and operating expenses decreased by million and million  respectively 
these declines resulted from the segment no longer providing facilities management services during these declines were partially offset by increases in consulting and programming revenues along with associated operating expenses  such as compensation  benefits and reimbursed costs 
in revenues increased due to higher consulting and programming revenues  placement services and non recurring revenue earned by providing services to a large facilities management customer 
these services were provided during a period of system conversion by this customer in connection with the termination of its contract 
operating expenses declined in due to downsizing efforts at the company s north carolina operation to change the focus from a product development and facilities management company to a fixed price contract programming services company 
included in the results of the advanced information services segment for the years ended december   and were intersegment revenues of   and  respectively  which were eliminated in consolidation 
the intercompany lbit loss before interest and taxes connected with the development of the company s natural gas distribution billing system  which was finalized during  totaled  and  for the years and  respectively 
other non operating income was   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to a one time termination fee paid to the advanced information services segment by its largest facilities management customer in connection with a change in control of that customer 
this was somewhat offset by costs to downsize the operation to no longer provide facilities management service in connection with its page it tm software 
environmental matters the company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental impact and explore corrective action at several former gas manufacturing plant sites see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that any future costs associated with these sites will be recoverable in rates 
competition historically  the company s natural gas operations have successfully competed with other forms of energy such as electricity  oil and propane 
the principal considerations have been price and to a lesser extent  accessibility 
since eastern shore has only recently elected to be an open access pipeline  with implementation during  the company has not previously been subject to the competitive pressures from other sellers of natural gas 
upon implementation of open access transportation services on eastern shore s system  third party suppliers will compete with the company to sell gas to the local distribution companies and the end users on eastern shore s system 
eastern shore will shift from providing sales service to providing contract storage and transportation services 
the company s distribution operations located in delaware and maryland will then face the possibility of the unbundling of their services to certain industrial customers  thus increasing the competition for sales services 
the company has already addressed these issues in and in its florida distribution operation  when the company was required to unbundle its services to large industrial customers 
the company established a natural gas brokering and supply operation to compete for these customers business 
both the propane distribution and the advanced information services businesses face significant competition from a number of larger competitors with substantially greater resources available to them than the company 
in addition  in the advanced information services business  changes are occurring rapidly which could adversely impact the markets for the company s services 
inflation inflation impacts the prices the company must pay for labor and other goods and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
in recent years  however  the impact of inflation has lessened  except for its effect on purchased gas costs 
although historically stable  these costs were higher in these costs are passed on to customers through the purchased gas adjustment clause in the company s tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investments and returns  the company seeks rate relief from its regulatory commissions for its regulated operations and constantly monitors the returns of its unregulated business operations 
cautionary statement statements made herein and elsewhere in this form k which are not historical fact are forward looking statements 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is providing the following cautionary statement to identify important factors that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements made herein or otherwise by or on behalf of the company 
a number of factors and uncertainties make it difficult to predict the effect on future operating results  relative to historical results  of eastern shore becoming an open access pipeline 
first  while open access is likely to diminish industrial interruptible sales margins  such sales have varied widely from year to year and  in future years  might make a less significant contribution to earnings even in the absence of open access 
second  the level of regulated transportation rates that will be in effect under open access has not yet been determined 
third  the outcome of eastern shore s rate increase filing with ferc for an increase in revenue earned on sales to regulated customers has not yet been determined 
fourth  there are a number of uncertainties  including the outcome of open access proceedings and the effects of competition  which will affect whether the company will be able to provide economical gas marketing services 
in addition  a number of factors and uncertainties affecting other aspects of the company s business could have a material impact on earnings 
with respect to the acquisition of tri county  these include actual performance for the future periods  the actual costs of the acquisition and the ability of the combined company to execute the integration and realize the expected synergies 
with respect to the company s business in general  these include the seasonality and temperature sensitivity of our natural gas and propane businesses  the relative price of alternative energy sources and the effects of competition both on our unregulated businesses and on natural gas sales once the company operates in an open access environment
