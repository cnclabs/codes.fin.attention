item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the financial statements incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k 
these financial statements include all adjustments which are  in the opinion of management  necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented  and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo represents net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items  minority interest in operating partnership income  gain or loss on disposition of real estate assets  and certain non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization  less preferred stock dividends 
the company computes ffo in accordance with nareit s current definition  which eliminates amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets as items added back to net income when computing ffo 
the company adopted this method of calculating ffo effective as of the nareit suggested adoption date of january  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes that ffo is helpful in understanding the company s results of operations in that such calculation reflects cash flow from operating activities and the company s ability to support interest payments and general operating expenses before the impact of certain activities such as changes in other assets and accounts payable 
for the year ended december   ffo increased by approximately  or  when compared to the year earlier adjusted only for the new nareit definition of ffo 
the increase was primarily attributable to an approximate  increase in revenues  which was partially offset by increases in expenses mainly associated with the increase in the number of apartment units owned by the company 
on a per share basis  ffo increased from per share restated for the effect of adoption of the current nareit ffo definition and the change in accounting policy for the year ended december  to per share for the same period in capital expenditures following a review of its capital expenditure and depreciation policy  effective january   the company implemented a new policy of which the primary changes are as follows a increase minimum dollar amounts to capitalize from to  b for stabilized communities generally  communities owned and operated by the company for at least one year  capitalize replacement purchases for major appliances and carpeting of an entire apartment unit which was previously expensed  and c reduce depreciation life for certain assets from years to to years 
the company believes that the newly adopted accounting policy is preferable because it is consistent with policies currently being used by the majority of the largest apartment reits and provides a better matching of expenses with the estimated benefit period 
the company s and financial statements were not restated for the effect of the change in accounting policy 
the policy has been implemented prospectively effective january  the following table presents the impact on net income of the company s new capitalization policy and adoption of nareit s current definition of ffo
