item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company entered into its current lines of business in november when it acquired eco environmental  and it has continued to expand its service capabilities  geographic presence and customer base primarily by acquiring other companies 
the company acquired eight businesses between fiscal and fiscal  and its revenues grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of such acquisitions 
the company accelerated its acquisition program in fiscal by adding the following operating subsidiaries industra service  srs  environmental evolutions  united eco and mm industra 
in march  the company completed its million acquisition of chempower 
the company intends to continue to expand its business through the acquisition of companies in the industrial maintenance  environmental remediation and specialty fabrication businesses 
the company s acquisition strategy entails the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the company will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable 
the company s acquisition strategy has led to rapid growth in the company s operations over the past four fiscal years 
the company s operations generally are managed at each of its subsidiaries  but core administrative  financing and strategic planning functions are performed at the holding company level 
this rapid growth has increased  and may continue to increase  the operating complexity of the company as well as the level and responsibility for both existing and new management personnel at the holding company level 
the company s ability to manage its expansion effectively will require it to hire and retain new management personnel at the holding company level and to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems 
the company s inability to effectively manage its expansion could have a materially adverse effect on its results of operations and financial results 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s revenues from its industrial and environmental segments may be affected by the timing of scheduled outages at its industrial customers facilities and by weather conditions with respect to projects conducted outdoors 
the effects of seasonality may be offset by the timing of large individual contracts  particularly if all or a substantial portion of the contracts fall within a oneto two quarter period 
accordingly  the company s quarterly results may fluctuate and the results of one fiscal quarter should not be deemed to be representative of the results of any other quarter or for the full fiscal year 
recognition of revenues the company recognizes revenues and profits on contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  contract revenues are accrued based upon the percentage that accrued costs to date bear to total estimated costs 
as contacts can extend over more than one accounting period  revisions in estimated total costs and profits during the course of work are reflected during the period in which the facts requiring the revisions become know 
losses on contracts are charged to income in the period in which such losses are first determined 
the percentage of completion method of accounting can result in the recognition of either costs and estimated profits in excess of billings or billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts  which are classified as current assets and liabilities  respectively  in the company s balance sheet

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the company s revenues grew to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of acquiring five new subsidiaries during fiscal because these acquisitions were completed at different times during fiscal  the company s results of operations do not reflect the full effect of such acquisitions 
the company s results of operations for fiscal reflect eleven months of operations for environmental evolutions  six months of operations for united eco  four months of operations of each of srs and industra service and one month of operations for mm industra 
prior to fiscal  the company had generated relatively insignificant revenues in canada at the holding company level from the licensing of certain environmental technologies and the provision of consulting services 
the company acquired industra service and mm industra  two canadian businesses  in fiscal as a result of these acquisitions  the company s canadian operations generated million  or of the company s total revenues  in fiscal management anticipates that the company will generate a larger percentage of its total revenues from its canadian operations as it benefits from a full fiscal year of operations of industra service and mm industra 
the company may expand its operations in canada through future acquisitions  although the company has no immediate plans to do so 
management anticipates that the increase in revenues generated by the company s canadian operating subsidiaries will increase the company s exposure to potential foreign currency exchange gains or losses 
during fiscal  the company generated approximately of its revenues from the provision of industrial maintenance services and of its revenues from the provisions of such services to petroleum and petrochemical refining customers 
huntsman corporation  star enterprising  goodyear tire and rubber and biolab together accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenue in fiscal no single customer accounted for more than of the company s total revenues during fiscal nevertheless  the loss of any one or more key customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation and financial condition 
management believes that the company s continued efforts to expand and diversify its customer base in addition to the effects of a full year of operations from its newly acquired operating subsidiaries will further reduce the company s dependence on certain key customers 
the company s industrial maintenance segment generated million  or  of the company s total revenues in fiscal compared to million  or  in fiscal this increase in revenues reflects  in part  the addition of four months of operations of industra service and srs 
the revenues generated by the company s industrial maintenance operations that were in place at november  grew in fiscal this internal growth was due  in part  to revenues generated on a single project that concluded in fiscal management anticipates that the revenues generated by its industrial maintenance service segment will represent a smaller percentage of its total revenues in fiscal as the company benefits form a full year of operations form mm industra  srs  united eco and environmental evolutions 
the revenues generated from the company s environmental services segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this growth primarily reflects the effects of four months of operations of each of industra service and srs and six months of operations of united eco 
prior to fiscal  only eco environmental provided environmental remediation services 
as a percentage of total revenues  the company s environmental remediation service segment contributed approximately to total revenues in fiscal as compared to of total revenues in fiscal management believes that this trend may continue in fiscal as such new subsidiaries are included in the company s results of operations for a full fiscal year 
the company significantly expanded its specialty fabrication service business in fiscal through the acquisition of industra service and mm industra  and this business segment generated  or less than  of the company s total revenues in fiscal management anticipates that the company s specialty fabrication services segment will generate more revenues and will contribute a greater percentage of the company s total revenues in fiscal prior to fiscal  the company had provided specialty fabrication services through the turner group and the lake charles group as part of those subsidiaries industrial maintenance services  and the company did not separately report revenues for specialty fabrication services 
the company will report revenues generated from the provision of such services by the turner group and the lake charles group in the specialty fabrication service segment 
the company will benefit from a full fiscal year of operations of industra service and mm industra as well as nine months of operations of chempower

revenues generated from the company s industrial maintenance segment increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the growth in revenues in this segment reflects the addition of the lake charles group  which contributed five months of operating income  or  the construction project for players international  inc accounted for much of the operating income generated by the lake charles group in fiscal revenues generated from the company s environmental service segment decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease in revenues from the company s environmental service segment reflected a temporary softening of the market for environmental remediation services coupled with a delay in the start of a major project until late in fiscal operating expenses the company realized a gross margin of  in fiscal operating expenses  which included interest expense on long term debt and depreciation and amortization  were  in fiscal compared to  in the prior fiscal year
