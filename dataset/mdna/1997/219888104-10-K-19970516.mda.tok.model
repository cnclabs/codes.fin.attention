the company expects net capital expenditures for fiscal of approximately  comprised of approximately  to be used for upgrading and enhancing its information systems  approximately  for warehouse reconfiguration and equipment  approximately  to be used for acquisition related initial capital costs  and approximately  for transportation and telecommunications equipment offset by anticipated sales and lease backs or mortgages on a number of its facilities of approximately  actual capital expenditures for fiscal may be greater or less than budgeted amounts

the repayment of debt includes the repayment of debt of acquired companies 
the company believes the borrowing capacity under the credit facility  together with proceeds from future debt and or equity activity  coupled with its cash on hand  capital resources and cash flows  will be sufficient to fund its ongoing operations  anticipated capital expenditures and acquisition activity for the next twelve months 
however actual capital needs may change  particularly in connection with acquisitions which the company may make in the future 
inflation certain of the company s product offerings  particularly paper products  have been and are expected to continue to be subject to significant price fluctuations due to inflationary and other market conditions 
the company generally is able to pass such increased costs on to its customers through price increases  although it may not be able to adjust its prices immediately 
significant increases in paper  fuel and other costs in the future could materially affect the company s profitability if these costs cannot be passed on to customers 
in general  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s product distribution business is subject to seasonal influences 
in particular  net sales and profits in the united states and canada are typically lower in the three months ended august due to lower levels of business activity during the summer months 
because cost of sales includes delivery and occupancy expenses  gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be impacted by seasonal fluctuations in net sales  more costly delivery costs during inclement weather  and the acquisition of less efficient operations 
quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
revenues and profit margins from the company s local delivery services are subject to seasonal variations 
prolonged inclement weather can have an adverse impact on the company s business to the extent that transportation and distribution channels are disrupted
