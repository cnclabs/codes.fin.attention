it is likely that  in some future quarter  the company s operating results will again be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
overview microware develops  markets and supports real time operating system software and high level language compilers used in consumer electronics  communications  process control and factory automation  scientific research  and government defense applications 
microware s product line is built around the os family of real time operating systems for advanced bit and bit microprocessors 
the company s os product family includes options for programming languages  networking  graphical interfaces and productivity tools 
substantially all of the company s revenues in the last and current fiscal years have been derived from licenses and related services from the os product family 
the company has historically derived revenues from development licenses and run time license royalty fees along with sales of related software productivity tools  maintenance support and custom contract engineering work 
custom contract engineering revenues are typically derived from discrete software engineering projects porting the os operating system along with customized software products 
commonly  license royalty fees follow the completion of these contracts 
for financial reporting purposes  product revenues primarily consist of software licenses and software development tool products  along with license run time royalty fees earned  including non refundable prepaid royalties 
services revenues principally consist of revenues from custom contract engineering and maintenance support agreements  along with consulting and training activity 
a key element of the company s long term strategy is to focus on markets the company anticipates will significantly increase run time license royalty fees 
since  the company has made significant investments targeting various emerging markets including wireless personal communications  interactive and digital television  and internet access devices  through the development of specialized software modules that utilize the os operating system 
david development licenses and related engineering services have been sold to over manufacturers of digital television decoders 
run time license royalty fees  maintenance support and ongoing software engineering contract work revenues are expected to grow with the development of the digital television  wireless communications and internet access device industries 
in july  the company entered into a software license and custom contract engineering agreement with motorola to develop modular software solutions for motorola s personal wireless communication devices 
revenues of approximately  and  resulted from contract engineering services for motorola in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition to up front development fees and future consulting and support activities  the company will receive a royalty for each pager or other wireless product using os sold by motorola or its sub licensees 
development license fees and run time royalties of  and resulted from this agreement in fiscal and  respectively 
these revenues related to products under development which motorola has not yet begun to distribute 
motorola also acquired an equity position in the company as part of this strategic relationship 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
from fiscal to fiscal the company s total product revenues demonstrated a significant increase in revenues from large account  vertical market product sales and related services  and a corresponding decrease in revenues from traditional run rate embedded systems business as a percentage of total revenues 
this trend resulted from the company s deliberate focus on the development of its vertical market business 
the focus on revenues from development licenses  non refundable prepaid royalties and custom engineering services from a relatively small number of customers  and the increase in product offerings for these customers  increased the quarterly variability of the company s financial results in fiscal management anticipates that this quarterly variability will continue for the foreseeable future  and  due to the fixed nature of most of the company s expenses and based on current revenue trends  currently anticipates an operating loss for at least the first two quarters of fiscal future growth in the company s product revenues will continue to be substantially dependent on its customers timely and successful development and distribution of new products using the company s products  making product revenues difficult to accurately forecast on a quarterly or annual basis 
results of operations amounts and percentage of revenues the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the amount and related percentage of the company s total revenues by each line item 
in thousands amounts and percentage of revenues years ended march  revenues product    services    cost of revenues product    services    gross profit    operating expenses research development    sales and marketing    general administrative    special charges operating profit loss   other income expense foreign currency gains losses  net interest expense income  net  earnings loss before income tax expense benefit   income tax expense benefit net earnings loss   insignificant fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues 
total revenues increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues anticipated for fiscal from certain strategic customers  including motorola  ibm and the company s david licensees  fell significantly below management s expectations due to customer delays in the development and distribution of os based products and other factors 
as a result  product revenue growth remained relatively flat from fiscal to the increase in overall company revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in services revenues 
services revenues increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal services revenues increased primarily as a result of the company engaging in the development of new processor ports 
in addition  services revenues increased as a result of the company adapting certain third party software to os for key wireless  internet and david customers 
the proportion of total revenues attributable to international sales decreased  from of total revenues in fiscal to of total revenues in fiscal year this decrease resulted from a proportionate increase in north american sales  the assignment of a services contract from an international subsidiary to the company s north american operations  and from foreign currency exchange movements  primarily in the japanese yen 
cost of revenues 
cost of product revenues includes direct and indirect costs for documentation  production quality including maintaining iso certification  duplication of manuals and media for software products  as well as those costs related to the packaging  shipping and delivery of the product to the customer 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs 
cost of services revenues includes direct and indirect costs for technical phone support  training and education  and custom engineering 
total cost of revenues increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of product revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of product revenues increased primarily due to the cost of third party software being bundled with os products 
cost of services revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in cost of services revenues is primarily attributable to increased services revenues with lower margins achieved on custom contract work 
amortization of capitalized software amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expense includes expenses associated with the development of new products and the enhancements of existing products  and consists primarily of employee salaries and related expenses 
research and development expense increased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase primarily resulted from an increase of approximately people  along with associated costs  in the company s technical staff from march  to march  additional technical staff was added primarily to support additional internet  wireless and digital television product offerings 
the company has made substantial investments in product development 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to enhance its existing products  to develop new products and to maintain technological competitiveness 
the company anticipates that it will continue to commit substantial resources to product development in the future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of sales and marketing personnel related costs  including sales commissions 
sales and marketing expense also includes costs of advertising  public relations and attendance at industry trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the overall increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the opening of a branch office in munich  germany and a sales office in osaka  japan 
sales commissions  sales support and product management personnel also increased in fiscal approximately  of the increase was due to an increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts resulted from an increase in the number of highly leveraged  emerging market customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses are primarily related to finance and administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the primary reason for the overall decrease is attributable to organizational changes in management responsibilities from general management to more direct duties associated with revenue production 
special charges 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded a non recurring special charge of  the special charges in fiscal related primarily to employee severance and related costs and lease termination costs for restructuring operations in europe

total revenues increased  or million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product and services revenues respectively increased  or  from million to million and  or million  from million to million in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in overall company revenues principally accrues to custom contract engineering and support activity reported in services revenues 
the increase in custom contract engineering revenue  from fiscal to fiscal  includes approximately million in new media projects primarily david  and million in customer paid porting of os product family technology to advanced microprocessors  wireless personal communication devices  along with related engineering advisory services 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased  or approximately million between the fiscal years ended march  and cost of product revenues remained relatively constant in amount  but decreased by of related sales from in fiscal  to in fiscal cost of services revenues increased by approximately million and from of related revenues to in fiscal  as compared to fiscal gross profit on product revenues increased by from to  and on services revenues by from to in fiscal as compared to fiscal amortization of capitalized software development cost included in cost of product revenues amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development 
although the company increased its technical staff from people at march  to people at march   the total amount of research and development expense decreased  or  from million to million in respective fiscal years 
the primary reason for the decrease is due to an increase in customer funded custom contract services revenue which transfers the recording of related engineering spending into the cost of services revenue line 
between fiscal years and an approximate million increase in engineering related expense has been charged to cost of services revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased by  or million from million to million  and as a percentage of revenue from to from fiscal to fiscal included in the million additional fiscal over fiscal costs are incremental costs of approximately million in advertising and public relations marketing consulting  million in additional commissions and salaries   in increased travel and trade show expense  and  in distributor sales force termination costs 
general and administrative 
overall  general and administrative expenses increased  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the overall increase in spending was primarily attributable to additional personnel and associated overhead costs necessary to support the overall growth of the company 
variability of quarterly operating results the company s revenues and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company believes its revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon such factors as new product introductions by the company or others  seasonality of customer buying patterns  the company s sales commission plan  renewals of product licenses by customers  product development expenses  changes in company and competitors pricing policies  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  the mix of international versus domestic revenues  currency fluctuations  the existence of product errors and the hiring and training of additional staff 
furthermore  delays in closing product licensing transactions or in completion of custom contract engineering work during any quarter could cause quarterly revenues and net earnings for that quarter to fall below anticipated levels 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a relatively small number of large account customers  therefore any delay in the consummation of business with this small number of customers could significantly impact the company s quarterly performance 
the majority of the company s revenues in a quarter has been historically derived from orders received in the last month of that quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and makes quarterly results difficult to forecast 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based on present expectations of future revenues levels  and a shortfall in revenues could result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net earnings 
as the markets in which the company competes mature and as new and existing companies compete for customers  price competition is likely to intensify and such competition could adversely affect quarterly operating results 
variations in product mix may also affect gross profit margin percentages 
therefore  although the company s revenues and gross profit in any period may increase in absolute terms  such an increase may result in lower gross profit margin percentages 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically funded its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  the sale of common and preferred stock and to a lesser extent long term debt 
at march   the company had approximately  in working capital and  in cash and short term investments as compared to  in working capital and  in cash and short term investments at march  the increase in working capital and cash and short term investments resulted from the company completing an initial public offering  effective april   of its common stock selling  new shares of common stock of the company and  shares offered by selling shareholders 
the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the new  shares of common stock were approximately  after deducting underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses 
cash provided by used in operating activities amounted to   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the  difference in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a change in net earnings from  to  and net changes in other reconciling items of  the  difference in cash provided by used in operating activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a change in net earnings loss of  an increase in trade receivables of  and net changes in other reconciling of cash used in investing activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the uses of cash in fiscal and were related primarily to the purchase of computer and research equipment and furniture and fixtures 
in fiscal  the increase in net cash used in investing activities as compared to fiscal was partially due to approximately  of cash being used to purchase land and construct the company s new corporate headquarter s facility 
on may   the company purchased approximately acres of land for approximately million  on which the company is constructing an  square foot office building to consolidate all des moines  iowa operations 
the estimated overall cost of the project is approximately  including associated land and is being financed by a  construction loan secured by short term investments  land and building 
in addition  cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately  from the purchase of short term investments and  from the equity investment in unwired planet inc cash provided by used in financing activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cash from financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to the issuance of  of common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cash from financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the issuance of approximately  in common stock in connection with the company s initial public offering and proceeds of approximately  on the company s construction loan 
as of march   the company had approximately  of long term debt  including current portion  outstanding relating to its current headquarters building and new headquarters building being currently constructed

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes current working capital and its million bank line of credit will be adequate to meet the company s future working capital  new product development and capital expenditure requirements at least through fiscal management does not believe that inflation has historically had a material effect on the company s results of operations 
many of the company s international contracts are denominated in local currencies  and an increase in the relative value of the dollar against such currencies would lead to a reduction in company revenues 
the company attempts to minimize its foreign currency exposure through keeping intercompany balances current and minimizing assets in any one currency denomination 
however  intercompany balances are not specifically hedged and there can be no assurance that the company s future results of operations will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company will be subject to certain risks  including tariffs and other barriers  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  difficulty in managing distributors and resellers  adverse tax consequences and difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
the company is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of protective legislation and regulations  including those relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from trade or foreign policy 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be implemented by the united states or any other country upon the import or export of the company s products in the future 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors or the adoption of restrictive policies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
