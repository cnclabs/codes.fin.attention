factors that may affect future results the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company s registration statement on form s filed in the first quarter of in connection with the anticipated acquisition of whitetree 
this report on form k should be read in conjunction with such form s  particularly the section entitled risk factors contained in the form s these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to competition  the mix of products sold  the mix of distribution channels employed  the company s success in developing  introducing and shipping new products  the company s success in integrating acquired operations  the company s dependence on single or limited source suppliers for certain components used in its products  price reductions for the company s products  risks inherent in international sales  changes in the levels of inventory held by third party resellers  the timing of orders from and shipments to customers  seasonality  the volatility in the trading price of the company s common stock and general economic conditions 
in particular  a substantial portion of the company s sales of max and pipeline products is related to the internet industry 
there can be no assurance that this industry and its infrastructure will continue to develop 
the company believes competition in the internet industry will increase significantly in the future and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has concluded the acquisition of four companies in the company has completed a fifth acquisition in and announced a sixth acquisition expected to be completed in the second quarter of achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions will depend in part upon whether the integration of the acquired companies products and technologies  research and development activities  and sales  marketing and administrative organizations is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
moreover  the integration process may temporarily divert management attention from the day to day business of the company 
failure to successfully accomplish the integration of the acquired companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company expects that its gross margins could be adversely affected in future periods by price adjustments as a result of increased competition 
in addition  the company also expects that its gross margins could be adversely affected in future periods by increased sales of its pipeline products as a percentage of net sales 
these products have lower gross margins than the company s other products 
in addition  the company s use of third parties to distribute its products to other value added resellers may adversely affect the company s gross margins 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net sales in future periods 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company depends on third party resellers for a substantial portion of its international sales 
certain of these third party resellers also act as resellers for competitors of the company that can devote greater effort and resources to marketing competitive products 
the loss of certain of these third party resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
although the company s sales will be denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
furthermore  future international activity may result in foreign currency denominated sales  and  in such event  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuation in the company s results of operations 
in addition  sales in europe and certain other parts of the world typically are adversely affected in the third quarter of each calendar year as many customers reduce their business activities during the summer months 
these seasonal factors may have an effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company typically operates with a relatively small backlog 
as a result  quarterly sales and operating results generally depend on the volume of  timing of and ability to fulfill orders received within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
a significant portion of the company s expense levels are relatively fixed in advance based in large part on the company s forecasts of future sales 
if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on the company s operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
the company may also increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
in september  the company introduced the max tnt  a high density  high capacity wan access switch  and the grf  a high performance ip switch 
the introduction of these and other new products requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
furthermore  products such as those offered by the company may contain undetected or unresolved hardware problems or software errors when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite extensive testing by the company  hardware problems or software errors will not be found in new products such as the max tnt and the grf after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in delay in or loss of market acceptance 
future delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of such products to gain market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
for additional risks relating to the company s business  see the discussions under the headings manufacturing and quality  competition  proprietary rights and employees in the business section of this filing 
in consideration of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain growth in revenues or profitability  particularly on a period to period basis
