net sales of inductive products increased approximately  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal net sales generated from mr products increased to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the overall increase in net sales from inductive and mr products was partially offset by the decrease in the net sales of ferrite metal in gap mig products  which reached their end of life during the third quarter of the net sales generated from mig products decreased to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal responding to the industry s rapid shift to mr technology  during the first quarter of fiscal the company announced plans to accelerate its existing mr transition strategy and to significantly reduce its production of advanced inductive products 
as a result  the company expects that mr products  which accounted for approximately of the company s net sales during fiscal  will account for the substantial majority of net sales during fiscal reflecting reduced demand for inductive products and this accelerated transition  the company has announced that it expects to take a non recurring charge of up to million during the first quarter of fiscal related to obsolete fixed assets and excess inventory associated with end of life inductive products 
further  as a result of these factors  the company expects net sales and earnings during the first quarter of fiscal to be lower than net sales and earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s net sales increase was attributable to overall increases in both unit sales and average selling prices asps during fiscal the overall increase in unit sales during fiscal was primarily due to increased unit sales for inductive and mr hsas  partially offset by a decrease in inductive hga unit sales and by the end of life of mig products 
the overall increase in asps during fiscal was primarily due to increased asps for both inductive and mr hsas  and to a lesser extent  to increased asps for hgas  primarily driven by mr products 
the company s product mix has continued to shift towards hsas  as net sales of hsas and hgas accounted for approximately and  respectively  of net sales during fiscal  compared to approximately and  respectively  of net sales during fiscal the company s sales continue to be primarily focused in the disk form factor market  accounting for  and of the company s net sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s customer base remains highly concentrated  as the substantial majority of net sales were to six major storage device manufacturers during fiscal and fiscal the company s three largest customers accounted for  and of the company s net sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million during fiscal  a decrease from net sales of  million during fiscal the decrease in net sales during fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in asps  partially offset by higher overall unit sales 
further  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company learned that to participate in certain customer programs  the company s products would have to incorporate a new technical feature the company had not yet begun developing 
though the company began development of necessary processes for this feature in the second quarter  the need to develop these processes caused delays in new product introductions  adversely impacting the company s revenues in the second half of the fiscal year 
in addition  mig products  which accounted for million of the company s sales during fiscal  reached their end of life during the third quarter of fiscal due to these factors as well as reductions in certain customer programs  the company s net sales declined for the last three consecutive quarters of fiscal for a discussion of certain risks associated with the company s business  see certain additional business risks 
gross margin the company s gross margins are primarily influenced by asps  the level of unit sales in relation to fixed costs  manufacturing yields  product mix newer products and hgas typically generate higher gross margins than older products and hsas and material costs 
the relative impact of these factors fluctuates from time to time 
periodically  the company s gross margins also reflect charges for inventory and fixed assets obsolescence and employee severance related to products or technologies that have reached their end of life 
hsas typically have lower gross margins than hgas 
hsas consist of two or more hgas and a variety of purchased components the company assembles into a single unit 
the cost of the purchased components is a significant percentage of the total cost of the hsa 
the gross margin from such purchased components is substantially lower than the gross margin on hgas produced by the company 
the combination of the respective margins on hgas and non hga components and associated labor and overhead included in hsas typically produces a lower aggregate gross margin on hsa sales compared to hga sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company s gross margin was of net sales during fiscal  compared to a gross margin of of net sales during fiscal the company s significant increase in gross margin during fiscal was primarily attributable to an overall increase in asps  an increase in total unit sales in relation to fixed costs  and to the absence in fiscal of special charges to cost of sales which totaled approximately million during fiscal 
the overall increase in asps during fiscal was primarily due to increased asps for inductive and mr hsas and  to a lesser extent  to increased asps for hgas  primarily driven by mr products 
the company s increase in total unit sales in relation to fixed costs was primarily related to increased unit sales of inductive and mr hsas  with a corresponding decrease in the overall cost per unit of inductive and mr hsas  as the company was able to more fully utilize its production equipment 
the company s increase in gross margin  as discussed above  was partially offset by a product mix weighted towards hsas  lower manufacturing yields associated with the introduction of new mr products  and a post closing million charge to cost of sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal to establish a reserve for inventory and equipment exposures related to the bankruptcy of micropolis  a customer of the company 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
a product mix weighted towards hsas tends to generate lower gross margins notwithstanding the higher asps 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company s gross margin was of net sales during fiscal  compared to a gross margin of of net sales during fiscal the company s decrease in gross margin during fiscal was primarily due to decreases in asps  the level of net unit sales in relation to fixed costs  a product mix heavily weighted toward older mig products and hsas and significant start up costs and lower manufacturing yields associated with new programs and processes 
in addition to these operating factors  the company incurred significant special charges during fiscal  of which approximately million was charged to cost of sales 
special charges to cost of sales in fiscal included approximately million in severance  relocation and other expenses incurred during the second quarter of fiscal associated with the consolidation of the company s san diego operations to northern california 
in response to sudden reductions in certain customer programs during the second half of fiscal  the rapid shift in the market place to newer technology products and the fact the programs the company had been participating in using mig technology reached the end of life  the company also incurred approximately million of charges  primarily to cost of sales  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal these charges included approximately million associated with the termination of approximately  employees primarily at the company s philippines operations  approximately million for the write down of capital assets  approximately million of inventory and approximately million in other expenses

from time to time  the company has engaged in fully or partially funded research and development for certain existing or potential customers 
r d expenses under such projects were offset as incurred to the extent of development funds available

fiscal compared to fiscal r d expenses were million during fiscal  a increase over r d expenses of million during fiscal the increase in r d expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to the license of planar technology from censtor corporation censtor and the continued development of such technology 
the largest component of the purchase price for censtor  technology in the development stage and a related license  was approximately million  which was expensed in march as acquired in process research and development 
selling  general administrative expenses fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general administrative sg a expenses were million during fiscal  a increase over sg a expenses of million during fiscal the increase in sg a expenses during fiscal was primarily due to a post closing charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal to establish a reserve for accounts receivable exposures related to the bankruptcy of a customer  micropolis 
the increase in sg a during the period was partially offset by a full year of cost reduction efforts which were implemented in the latter half of fiscal see also note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company plans to continue its sg a cost containment efforts  and thus does not expect sg a expenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars in the near term compared to the sg a expenses during fiscal excluding the post closing charge of million related to the micropolis bankruptcy  but anticipates sg a expenses will vary from year to year as a percentage of net sales  depending on the level of net sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal sg a expenses were million during fiscal  a decrease over sg a expenses of million during fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses during fiscal was primarily due to cost reduction programs implemented by the company during the second half of fiscal in response to declining net sales levels  partially offset by increases in staffing and overhead to support higher net sales and volume during the first half of fiscal interest expense fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the increase in interest expense during fiscal was primarily due to a million charge in the fourth quarter related to a pre payment premium and incremental interest expense associated with the company s refinancing of million in senior notes  and interest on the company s million convertible subordinated debentures which were issued in august see liquidity and capital resources
