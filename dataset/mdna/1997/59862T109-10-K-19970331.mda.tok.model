page of the company s inventory purchases in were approximately from japanese factories and approximately from germany and austria combined 
the significant portion of inventory purchases in foreign currencies exposes the company to foreign currency fluctuations which can affect the company s gross profit margin 
the us dollar has stabilized and strengthened recently in relation to the japanese yen and german mark from its substantial weakening in early to hedge against potential foreign currency swings  the company has strategies in place which are intended to minimize the adverse impact of foreign currency on its business 
these strategies are i currency risk sharing arrangements with the company s japanese suppliers  ii forward exchange contract coverage on part of its german mark related purchases  iii sourcing of products from countries other than japan and germany where feasible  and iv converting certain purchases from foreign currency to us dollar denominations 
the currency risk sharing arrangements minimize the impact of currency swings by the equal sharing of currency exposures against inventory purchases denominated in japanese yen between the suppliers and the company 
future fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies can impact earnings in future periods 
the company has two primary distribution centers in the united states  located in secaucus  new jersey and long beach  california 
while the secaucus facility is owned  the long beach facility is leased pursuant to a lease expiring in january which includes two one year extension options

in march  the company announced plans to construct a new distribution facility in south carolina 
construction of the  square foot facility commenced in the second quarter of and is anticipated to be completed in the latter part of as of december   million of the million capital commitments associated with this facility had been incurred 
the company expects to finance the balance of this capital commitment principally with cash generated from operations or from long term borrowings as the company is also evaluating possible alternative methods of financing the facility 
the new facility should enable the company to eliminate the need for offsite facilities in long beach and secaucus and accommodate substantially increased volume 
the company believes that the use of state of the art distribution technology in the new facility and relief from inefficiencies resulting from overcrowding of existing facilities should provide long term benefits 
the company anticipates certain transition costs in the mid term which may impact earnings at that time

as of december   total retail store count increased to  including the canadian store and the stores planned for closure which were in operation at the end of the number of states in which the company operates retail stores also increased to the company plans to pursue continued expansion of its store network in the united states and canada 
present plans include opening between and new retail stores in each of and each store requires a commitment of inventory  fixtures  equipment and pre opening store expenses 
additionally  as the company expands its international operations  working capital will be required to fund increased inventories and accounts receivable 
page of the company currently estimates that its aggregate capital expenditures and initial investments including inventory for stores in and will approximate up to million 
this includes the expansion of the company s retail store network  expansion of its international operations and the million remaining of the estimated million for the construction of the new distribution facility 
in each of these cases  there can be no assurance that the company s capital expenditures will not exceed this estimated amount 
future developments in  the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing financial assets extinguishments of liabilities 
management does not believe that adoption of this accounting standard will have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  the company s operations have been seasonal  with higher sales and net income occurring in the third and fourth quarters  reflecting increased demand during the year end holiday selling season 
since the biggest retail selling season is the year end holiday season  and as more of the company s principal department store customers adopt electronic data interchange which allows them to defer shipments until later in the selling season  future sales are expected to be more heavily weighted toward the third and fourth quarters 
in addition  the company s retail stores experience a similar seasonal selling pattern  however  sales are more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter 
as a result  as the company increases the number of stores  the shift of sales volume toward the latter part of the year is expected to continue 
the company s results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of the amount and timing of sales contributed by  and expenses related to the opening of  new retail stores and the integration of such stores into the operations of the company  as well as other factors 
the addition of a significant number of retail stores  as is anticipated with the company s store expansion program  can therefore significantly affect results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis 
as the addition of new stores continue  operating income for the first and second quarters will be more impacted by the combination of seasonally lower sales volumes during this period and increased operating expenses from an increased percentage of expenses being fixed that relate to retail stores and the additional expense layering from new immature stores
