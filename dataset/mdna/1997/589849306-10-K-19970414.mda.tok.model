in to a net loss per share of in variability of quarterly results and seasonality historically  the company has experienced variability in its net sales and operating margins on a quarterly basis and expects these patterns to continue in the future 
management believes that the factors influencing quarterly variability include i the overall growth in the computer industry  ii shifts in short term demand for the company s products resulting  in part  from the introduction of new products or updates of existing products  and iii the fact that virtually all sales in a given quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
due to the factors noted above  as well as the dynamic characteristics of the computer product distribution industry  the company s revenues and earnings may be subject to material volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
additionally  in the us and canada  the company s net sales in the fourth quarter have been historically higher than in its other three quarters 
management believes that the pattern of higher fourth quarter sales is partially explained by customer buying patterns relating to calendar year end business and holiday purchases 
as a result of this pattern the company s working capital requirements in the fourth quarter have typically been greater than other quarters 
net sales in the canadian operations are also historically strong in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
this is primarily due to buying patterns of canadian government agencies

asset management merisel attempts to manage its inventory position to maintain levels sufficient to achieve high product availability and same day order fill rates 
inventory levels may vary from period to period  due to factors including increases or decreases in sales levels  merisel s practice of making large volume purchases when it deems such purchases to be attractive  and the addition of new manufacturers and products
