introduction since its inception in  endosonics has been engaged primarily in the research and development of products for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
since  a majority of the company s net revenue has been derived from sales of its ivus imaging systems and catheters 
the company markets and distributes its ivus imaging products in the united states  europe and japan through relationships with strategic partners  certain other distributors and  to a lesser extent  through a direct sales force 
in february  endosonics and cordis entered into the exclusive distribution agreement pursuant to which cordis was granted the exclusive right to distribute endosonics ivus imaging products for coronary applications in north america  europe  africa and the middle east 
the exclusive distribution agreement supersedes and replaces a prior distribution agreement between cordis and endosonics and a prior distribution agreement between endosonics nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary of endosonics  and cordis bv cordis is obligated during each year of the exclusive distribution agreement to use reasonable efforts to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of products from endosonics 
subject to certain exceptions  cordis failure to meet the minimum annual purchase amount during any year of the exclusive distribution agreement shall constitute a material breach of such agreement 
cordis is also obligated during the term of the exclusive distribution agreement to undertake certain efforts to market  promote  distribute and sell endosonics ivus imaging products  including the provision of adequate personnel and facilities  the maintenance of sufficient inventory for demonstration purposes and the appointment of a united states and european intracoronary ultrasound marketing manager to interface with endosonics united states and european clinical and support staff 
the exclusive distribution agreement also contains standard representations and warranties of each party and standard provisions regarding indemnification  service and maintenance and confidentiality 
under the terms of the exclusive distribution agreement  cordis shall purchase ivus imaging products from endosonics at agreed upon prices set forth in such agreement  which prices shall be jointly reviewed by endosonics and cordis every six months 
the exclusive distribution agreement initially expires on december   but may be extended by the parties for successive one year periods 
in connection with the execution of the exclusive distribution agreement  the company issued  shares of its common stock to cordis in a private placement transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  the company has since registered the shares of common stock issued to cordis 
the company and cordis are currently in discussions with regard to amending the exclusive distribution agreement to cover both south america and japan

cardiovascular dynamics  inc  formerly an owned subsidiary of the company s  designs  develops  manufactures and markets catheters used to treat certain vascular diseases 
cvd s catheters are used in conjunction with angioplasty and other interventional procedures such as vascular stenting and drug delivery 
cvd s proprietary focal and multiple microporous membrane m technologies enable physicians to deliver therapeutic radial force  stents  drugs or contrast media accurately and effectively to the treatment site in addition to allowing the perfusion of blood during an interventional procedure 
cvd s catheters are designed to address three principal challenges facing cardiologists restenosis of a treated vessel  chronic total occlusions and acute reclosure of a vessel during or soon after a procedure 
cvd completed its initial public offering in june of and  as a result  its assets  liabilities and results of operations are no longer included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company currenty holds approximately of the outstanding shares of the common stock of cvd and accounts for its investment on the equity method 
the company s business strategy includes acquiring related businesses  products or technologies 
in january  the company entered into an agreement to acquire cardiometrics  inc through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into cardiometrics  with cardiometrics surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company expects to incur an approximate million dollar in process research and development charge as a result of the acquisition 
the company expects that it may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
any future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the write off of in process research and development  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  if the company is unable to use the pooling of interests method of accounting  the company will be required to amortize any intangible assets acquired in connection with any additional acquisitions and the amortization periods for such costs will be over the useful lives of such assets  which range from two years to eight years 
additionally  unanticipated expenses may be incurred relating to the integration of technologies and research and development and administrative functions 
any acquisition will involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s employees  operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees as well as the costs associated with completing the acquisition and integrating the acquired company 
the company acquired du med bv du med in in order to obtain micromotor ivus technology and subsequently established the company s european headquarters at du med s facility in the netherlands 
in  the company introduced both its oracle imaging system  a platform upgrade from its previous system  and enhanced imaging catheters 
the company also commenced the pinnacle development project  which involved the development of new ivus technology and resulted in the five catheter line and an enhanced oracle imaging system 
the company announced the receipt of fda approval to market these products in october in addition  the company announced the receipt of a pma to market its focal catheter in october cvd began sales of the focal catheter commenced in the company began commercial sales of the enhanced oracle imaging system in the fourth quarter of and began commercial sales of the five catheter line in the first quarter of the company is currently expanding its manufacturing capacity for these new products 
see business manufacturing 
the company s financial results will be affected in the future by certain factors  including the scaling up of manufacturing for the company s five catheter line  market acceptance of the company s new products and the revenue mix between sales of imaging systems and catheters and changes in government regulation regarding third party reimbursement applicable to the company s system and products

in  export sales as a percentage of total revenue decreased to as compared to in the company currently anticipates that export sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of the company s total revenue in future periods 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased to approximately in from in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales in was reduced principally by improved manufacturing efficiencies  offset by expenses of  related to the voluntary recall of its visions ivus imaging catheters in the first quarter of due to manufacturing defects 
the recall negatively impacted the ability of the company to sell catheters during the first quarter of due to production capacity limitations associated with the replacement of these defective catheters 
gross profit margins improved to in as compared to in despite the negative impact of the voluntary product recall 
due to the uncertainty associated with continued improvements in the efficiency of the company s manufacturing process and the impact of increasingly competitive pricing  there can be no assurance that the company s gross profit margin will be maintained or continue to improve in future periods 
acquired in process  research development and clinical 
acquired in process research  development and clinical expenses decreased to  in from approximately million in in june  endosonics recorded a non cash charge of  reflecting the final payment in connection with the acquisition of cvd 
on august   endosonics acquired all of the capital stock of du med 
the excess of endosonics cost over the fair values assigned to the net assets of du med acquired in the amount of approximately million was charged to acquired in process research  development and clinical expenses in the quarter ended september   because the principal assets acquired are products still in the development stage that have not yet received regulatory approval

net cash used in operations was million in  as compared to million in cash used in operating activities includes funding the operating loss partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory versus levels  and increases in current liabilities 
the company anticipates using cash resources primarily for capital expenditures  product development  sales and marketing  and working capital purposes  prior to achieving positive cash flow from operations 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of december  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements through however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
see future operating results history of operating losses  anticipated future losses 
tax matters as of december   the company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards began expiring and will continue to expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change of ownership rules provided by the internal revenue code and similar state tax provisions 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
risk factors history of operating losses  anticipated future losses 
the company was founded in and has experienced annual operating losses since its inception 
the company s accumulated deficit at december  was approximately million 
the company expects to continue to incur operating losses through and there can be no assurance that the company will ever be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
although the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements through  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing or that such financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
acquisitions 
the company s business strategy includes acquiring related businesses  products or technologies 
in january  the company entered into an agreement to acquire cardiometrics  inc through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into cardiometrics  with cardiometrics surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company expects to incur an approximate million dollar in process research and development charge as a result of the such acquisition 
the company expects that it may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
any future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the write off of in process research and development  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  if the company is unable to use the pooling of interests method of accounting  the company will be required to amortize any intangible assets acquired in connection with any additional acquisitions and the amortization periods for such costs will be over the useful lives of such assets  which range from two years to eight years 
additionally  unanticipated expenses may be incurred relating to the integration of technologies and research and development and administrative functions 
any acquisition will involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s employees  operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees as well as the costs associated with completing the acquisition and integrating the acquired company 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
although external ultrasound imaging and balloon angioplasty are widely used technologies  the use of ivus imaging in connection with interventional cardiology is relatively new 
the commercial success of the company s products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community as a useful  cost effective component of interventional cardiovascular and peripheral vascular procedures 
ivus imaging is used in conjunction with angioplasty and other intravascular procedures such as vascular stenting 
accordingly  the medical community must determine that the information obtained from the use of the company s ultrasound products will increase the safety or effectiveness or lower the overall cost of the care being provided and that the value of such information justifies the incremental expense of obtaining ivus imaging 
in addition  market acceptance of the company s combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging catheters will depend  among other things  on a determination by the medical community that the efficacy of the therapeutic component of the company s combination catheters is at least comparable to that of competing non imaging angioplasty catheters and other types of therapy 
although ivus imaging devices have been available for over ten years  the market for such products has remained relatively small 
although the company believes the benefits of ivus imaging can be demonstrated  there can be no assurance that the benefits will be considered sufficient by the medical community to enable the company s products to achieve widespread market acceptance 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

dependence on strategic relationships  reliance on cordis 
in february  endosonics and cordis entered into the exclusive distribution agreement pursuant to which cordis was granted the exclusive right to distribute endosonics ivus imaging products for coronary applications in north america  europe  africa and the middle east 
the exclusive distribution agreement supersedes and replaces a prior distribution agreement between cordis and endosonics and a prior distribution agreement between endosonics nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary of endosonics  and cordis sa cordis is obligated during each year of the exclusive distribution agreement to use reasonable efforts to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of products from endosonics 
subject to certain exceptions  cordis failure to meet the minimum annual purchase amount during any year of the exclusive distribution agreement shall constitute a material breach of such agreement 
cordis is also obligated during the term of the exclusive distribution agreement to undertake certain efforts to market  promote  distribute and sell endosonics ivus imaging products  including the provision of adequate personnel and facilities  the maintenance of sufficient inventory for demonstration purposes and the appointment of a united states and european intracoronary ultrasound marketing manager to interface with endosonics united states and european clinical and support staff 
the exclusive distribution agreement also contains standard representations and warranties of each party and standard provisions regarding indemnification  service and maintenance and confidentiality 
under the terms of the exclusive distribution agreement  cordis shall purchase ivus imaging products from endosonics at agreed upon prices set forth in such agreement  which prices shall be jointly reviewed by endosonics and cordis every six months 
the exclusive distribution agreement initially expires on december   but may be extended by the parties for successive one year periods 
the company and cordis are currently in discussions with regard to amending the exclusive distribution agreement to cover both south america and japan 
in light of the company s exclusive distribution relationship with cordis  the company s revenue from sales of ivus imaging products will depend substantially on the distribution capabilities of cordis 
further  in recent years there has been significant consolidation among medical device suppliers as the major suppliers have attempted to broaden their product lines in order to focus on product configurations that address a given procedure or treatment and in order to respond to cost pressures from health care providers 
this consolidation has made it increasingly difficult for smaller suppliers  such as the company  to effectively distribute their products without a major relationship with one of the major suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its relationship with cordis or replace cordis in the event the company s relationship with cordis would be terminated 
in the event of such a termination  the company s ability to distribute its ivus imaging products would be materially adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on new products  rapid technological change 
the medical device industry generally  and the ivus imaging device market in particular  are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce new products that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products that achieve market acceptance or that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products 
in october  the company announced the receipt of approval from the fda to market its five diagnostic catheters  which are designed to enhance image quality and reduce manufacturing cost relative to the company s oracle micro tm catheter line 
the company introduced the five diagnostic catheters in november and commenced commercial shipments of these catheters in the first quarter of any failure to meet this schedule could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any that are being developed by the company  or that such competitors will not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for introducing or commercializing any such products prior to the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
see business products 
dependence on international sales 
the company derives  and expects to continue to derive  a significant portion of its revenue from international sales 
in  and  the company s international sales were million  million and million  respectively  or  and of total revenue 
therefore  a significant portion of the company s revenues will continue to be subject to the risks associated with international sales  including economic or political instability  shipping delays  changes in applicable regulatory policies  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and various trade restrictions  all of which could have a significant impact on the company s ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
future imposition of  or significant increases in the level of  customs duties  import quotas or other trade restrictions  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
the regulation of medical devices  particularly in the european community  continues to expand and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on the company 
limited manufacturing experience 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with the fda s gmp regulations  iso and other regulatory requirements  in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
cvd has limited experience producing its products in commercial quantities 
in addition  the company intends to establish an automated manufacturing process for its five catheter line in rancho cordova  california 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products and integrating automation equipment  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
the company s failure to fully integrate automation into the manufacturing process for the five catheter line in a timely manner  or to timely increase production volumes of the five catheter line  would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
the company instituted two voluntary product recalls in due to manufacturing defects in its visions tm ivus imaging catheter line 
there can be no assurance that defects will not occur in the company s products in the future 
failure to increase production volumes in a timely or cost effective manner or to maintain compliance with gmp  iso or other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company purchases many standard and custom built components from independent suppliers  and contracts with third parties for certain specialized electronic component manufacturing processes 
most of these purchased components and processes are available from more than one vendor 
however  the manufacturing of the connection points on the integrated circuit microchips is currently performed by a single vendor 
although the company is in the process of identifying alternative vendors  the qualification of additional or replacement vendors for certain components or services is a lengthy process 
any supply interruption from this single source vendor would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products until a new source of supply was qualified and  as a result  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and government regulation 
limitations on third party reimbursement 
in the united states  the company s products are purchased primarily by medical institutions  which then bill various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid  and other government programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to patients 
government agencies  private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and reimburse hospitals for medical treatment at a fixed rate based on the drg established by the us hcfa 
the fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed  and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
if a procedure is not covered by a drg  payors may deny reimbursement 
in addition  some payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary  inappropriate or not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
currently  there are no established drgs covering diagnostic ivus imaging procedures 
reimbursement of balloon angioplasty procedures is covered under a drg  but because the amount of reimbursement is fixed  the amount of potential profit relating to the procedure is reduced to the extent the physician performs additional procedures such as ivus imaging or uses a more expensive product which combines ivus imaging with therapeutic capabilities 
accordingly  physicians must determine that the clinical benefits of ivus imaging justify the additional cost 
although the company believes that less invasive procedures generally provide less costly overall therapies as compared to alternative surgical procedures  there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such less invasive procedures will continue to be available  or that future reimbursement policies of payors will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  or changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for the company s products could be adversely affected by changes in governmental and private third party payors policies 
capital costs for medical equipment purchased by hospitals are currently reimbursed separately from drg payments 
recent federal legislation reduced capital cost reimbursements under the medicare capital cost pass through system 
the legislation requires that the aggregate amount of reimbursements in fiscal years through be reduced by approximately per year 
such reductions have had an adverse impact on reimbursements to hospitals for the capital cost of equipment such as the oracle imaging system 
moreover  the company is unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on the company 
see business third party reimbursement 
competition 
competition in the market for devices used in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease is intense  and is expected to increase 
the interventional cardiology market is characterized by rapid technological innovation and change  and the company s products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
the company s digital  all electronic ivus imaging catheters compete with mechanical ultrasound devices manufactured by cvis and hewlett packard 
both cvis and hewlett packard are significantly larger than the company  have significantly greater financial  sales and marketing and technical resources available and have significantly larger installed bases of imaging systems 
these competitors have also developed ivus imaging products with high quality images and the company believes that its competitive position is dependent upon its ability to establish its reputation as a producer of high quality ivus imaging products 
there can be no assurance that these companies are not currently developing  or will not attempt to develop  combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging catheters that would compete with the company s combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging products 
moreover  companies currently engaged in the manufacture and marketing of non imaging angioplasty catheters could attempt to expand their product lines to include combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging products 
the company s combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging catheters compete or will compete with therapeutic catheters marketed by a number of manufacturers  including acs  scimed  cordis  medtronic  inc medtronic  and schneider usa  a subsidiary of pfizer  inc schneider 
such companies have substantial resources  established market positions  and significantly larger sales and marketing organizations 
in addition  the company faces competition from manufacturers of atherectomy devices  vascular stents and pharmaceutical products intended to treat cardiovascular disease 
see business competition 
reliance on patents and proprietary technology  risk of patent infringement 
the company holds six issued united states patents and has other united states and several foreign patent applications pending covering various aspects of its ivus imaging technology 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company s patent applications will issue as patents or that any issued patents will provide competitive advantages for the company s products or will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by its competitors 
although the company attempts to ensure that its products do not infringe other party s patents and proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that its products do not infringe such patents or rights 
the interventional cardiovascular market has been characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents  or would be required to obtain licenses from the owners of any such patents or redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be so on terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary technology and enters into confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with its employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that the confidentiality of such trade secrets or proprietary information will be maintained by employees  consultants  advisors or others  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in such a manner that the company has no practical recourse 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity  to enforce patents issued to the company or to protect trade secrets and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company 
see business patents and proprietary technology 
government regulation 
the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in the united states and in other countries 
the company believes that its success will be significantly dependent upon commercial sales of improved versions of its imaging systems and catheter products 
the company will not be able to market these new products in the united states unless and until the company obtains approval from the fda 
if a medical device manufacturer can establish that a newly developed device is substantially equivalent to a device that was legally marketed prior to may  or to a device that the fda has found to be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed pre device  the manufacturer may seek clearance from the fda to market the device by filing a premarket notification with the fda under section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act k 
there can be no assurance that k clearance for any future product or modification of an existing product will be granted or that the process will not be unduly lengthy 
all of the k clearances received for the company s catheters were based on substantial equivalence to legally marketed pre devices 
review of the substantially equivalent pre devices on which the k clearances for the company s catheters were based and any resulting restrictions on the company or requirements imposed to present additional data could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if substantial equivalence cannot be established  or if the fda determines that the device or the particular application for the device requires a more rigorous review  the fda will require that the manufacturer submit a pma application that must be reviewed and approved by the fda prior to sales and marketing of the device in the united states 
the pma process is significantly more complex  expensive and time consuming than the k clearance process and frequently requires the submission of clinical data 
it is expected that certain of the company s combination angioplasty ivus imaging products under development will be subject to this pma process 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other consequences  result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
in addition  governmental regulations may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
delays in receipt of approvals  failure to receive approvals or the loss of previously received approvals would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is also required to register as a medical device manufacturer with the fda and certain state agencies  such as the food and drug branch of cdhs 
as such  the company is inspected on a routine basis by both the fda and the cdhs for compliance with the gmp regulations 
these regulations require that the company manufacture its products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and control activities 
further  the company is required to comply with various fda requirements for labeling 
the medical device reporting regulation requires that the company provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
in addition  the fda prohibits an approved device from being marketed for unapproved applications 
specifically  the company s focal balloon catheters are approved in certain european countries 
the company believes that these catheters are being used in those countries principally for deployment of coronary stents and balloon angioplasty 
in october  endosonics received fda approval to market cvd s line of fact catheters  which utilize the focal technology  for coronary balloon angioplasty 
without specific fda approval for use in stent deployment  these catheters may not be marketed by the company in the united states for such use 
if the fda believes that a company is not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  it can institute proceedings to detain or seize products  issue a recall  prohibit marketing and sales of the company s products and assess civil and criminal penalties against the company  its officers or its employees 
the company is also subject to other federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices 
the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business products and government regulation
