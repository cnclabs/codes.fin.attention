claire currently under construction in atlanta  georgia for approximately million 
the apartment home community is expected to be purchased  after reaching rental stabilization  in the fourth quarter of certain factors affecting the performance of development communities the company is optimistic about the operating prospects of the communities under construction even with the increased supply of newly constructed apartment homes of comparable quality in many of its markets 
as with any development community  there are uncertainties and risks associated with the development of the communities described above 
while the company has prepared development budgets and has estimated completion and stabilization target dates based on what it believes are reasonable assumptions in light of current conditions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that the company will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of materials  weather conditions or other events 
other development risks include the possibility of incurring additional cost or liability resulting from defects in construction materials and the possibility that financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  to pursue or complete development activities 
similarly  market conditions at the time these communities become available for leasing will affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period of time necessary to achieve stabilization  which could make one or more of the development communities unprofitable or result in achieving stabilization later than currently anticipated 
in addition  the company is conducting feasibility and other pre development work for nine communities 
the company could abandon the development of any one or more of these potential communities in the event that it determines that market conditions do not support development  financing is not available on favorable terms or other circumstances prevent development 
similarly  there can be no assurance that if the company does pursue one or more of these potential communities that it will be able to complete construction within the currently estimated development budgets or that construction can be started at the time currently anticipated 
capitalization of fixed assets and property improvements the company has established a policy of capitalizing those expenditures relating to acquiring new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset 
all expenditures necessary to maintain a community in ordinary operating condition including replacement carpets are expensed as incurred 
capitalized expenditures for the years ended december   and are summarized as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  acquisition of communities    construction of communities    capitalized interest   cost of acquiring existing communities in conjunction with the initial business combination  non recurring capital expenditures construction of garages access gates new signage water meters washer dryer units major improvements  improvements at acquisition other total non recurring  recurring capital expenditures exterior painting  other   total recurring    includes the assumption of million  million and million of debt in  and respectively 
in addition  includes conversion of equity investment into fixed assets of million in conjunction with the purchase of summit plantation in and the issuance of million units of the operating partnership with a value of million in includes the issuance of million   and  of units in the operating partnership for the acquisition of land in  and  respectively 
construction of communities was funded primarily by development loans  equity offering proceeds and borrowing under the credit facilities 
other additions and improvements were funded primarily by community operations and the credit facilities 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which  coupled with the relatively high occupancy rates  may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation 
funds from operations the company generally considers funds from operations to be an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
funds from operations  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of assets or debt restructuring  plus certain non cash items  primarily real estate depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for all periods consisted only of real estate depreciation 
funds available for distribution is defined as funds from operations less recurring capital expenditures funded by operations 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution are calculated as follows dollars in thousands pro forma net income     minority interest of unitholders in operating partnership     extraordinary items  depreciation real estate assets     summit plantation funds from operations     recurring capital expenditures     funds available for distribution     weighted average shares and units outstanding     the pro forma information is presented as if the initial offering had occurred as of january  the above funds from operations calculations in   pro forma and historical reflect changes required by nareit for fiscal years beginning in the primary effect of the changes on the company s calculation of funds from operations was that amortization of financing cost is no longer added back in arriving at funds from operations 
funds from operations under the previous calculation method would have been million  million  million and million for the years ended december    pro forma and historical  respectively
