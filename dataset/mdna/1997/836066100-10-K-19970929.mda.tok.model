the registrant had working capital of approximately  as of june   a decrease of approximately  from june  the decrease in working capital between fiscal years results primarily from the decrease in accounts payable of approximately  which was partially offset by the increase of approximately  in borrowings under the registrant s revolving credit facility  the collection of approximately  of income taxes receivable and a  reduction in the registrant s cash balances 
the decrease in accounts payable is directly related to the reduced inventory turn in the last quarter of fiscal year together with reduced vendor payment terms 
the interest rate under the registrant s revolving credit facility fluctuated between and during fiscal year as of june   the outstanding borrowings under the registrant s revolving credit facility were  the increase of approximately  in outstanding borrowing in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily related to the installation of a new computer system and the store relocation in november  which in the aggregate represented approximately  of the registrant s capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal year over the past year  certain trade creditors have reduced the time period for eligibility for cash or payment discounts 
this reduction coupled with the reduction in inventory turn ratio are the primary reasons for the reduction in accounts payable 
accordingly  the registrant utilized its revolving credit facility in part to take advantage of such discount terms 
the registrant currently believes that funds from the registrant s operations combined with borrowings available under its revolving credit facility with foothill and vendor credit programs will be sufficient to satisfy its currently projected operating cash requirements during fiscal year  including those capital expenditures required in connection with the store expansion and store relocation currently planned in fiscal in that regard  the registrant is also considering use of sale leaseback or other financing techniques in connection with financing such expansion and store relocation provided that such financing techniques can be utilized with respect to the store locations chosen 
see expansion in item the registrant may need to seek additional sources of financing debt and or equity or a combination thereof in order to proceed with any expansion program beyond fiscal year the foothill revolving credit facility matures in july together with the principal balance in the approximate amount of  of the mortgage loan encumbering the registrant s former fort lauderdale store 
the registrant has held preliminary discussions with foothill in connection with the extension of its facility and has received interest from other lenders to refinance the foothill facility 
management believes  although there is no assurance they will be successful in doing so  that the extension or refinancing of the foothill facility will be accomplished prior to july  as well as the refinancing or other repayment of the above described mortgage loan 
impact of inflation and foreign currency fluctuations the registrant does not believe that either inflation or foreign currency fluctuations has had a material impact upon its operating results because technological advances in the products sold by the registrant and changes in the components of products  together with increased competition among the registrant s vendors  have kept the product prices stable 
where the prices of products have increased  the registrant has generally been able to pass on such increases to its customers
