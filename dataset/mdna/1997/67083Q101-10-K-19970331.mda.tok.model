there were orthodontic centers in states at december  the following table sets forth certain information relating to the growth in the number of orthodontic centers for the periods shown year ended december  number of centers at beginning of period number of centers developed during period number of centers acquired during period number of centers consolidated during period 
number of centers at end of period at december   of the orthodontic centers at that time were located in general dentists offices 
during  the company began pursuing a strategy of relocating orthodontic centers to free standing locations  pursuant to which each of these orthodontic centers was relocated to free standing locations 
at december   only three of the orthodontic centers were located in a general dentist s office 
the company intends to relocate these three remaining orthodontic centers to free standing locations as soon as practicable 
in developing additional orthodontic centers  the company intends to locate the orthodontic centers only in free standing locations 
by locating in free standing locations  orthodontic centers have been able to increase available operating days and thereby enhance their revenue producing capability 
of the orthodontic centers at december   were developed by the company and were existing orthodontic practices whose assets were acquired by the company 
the company expects that future growth in orthodontic centers will come from both developing orthodontic centers with existing and newly recruited affiliated orthodontists and acquiring the assets of  and entering into long term agreements with  existing practices 
the average cost of developing a new orthodontic center is approximately  including the cost of equipment  leasehold improvements  working capital and losses associated with the initial operations of the orthodontic center 
the costs of developing a new orthodontic center are shared by the company and the particular affiliated orthodontist 
the company assists affiliated orthodontists in obtaining financing of their share of such costs through the company s primary lender 
for new developments  the company has discontinued financing affiliated orthodontists share of losses associated with the initial operations of the orthodontic center  which were historically financed by the company as an unsecured advance repayable by the affiliated orthodontist over a five year period and bearing interest at per annum above the prime rate  with repayment beginning upon the attainment of positive cash flow by the orthodontic center which generally occurs approximately months after an orthodontic center commences operations 
the company intends  however  to continue to make advances of approximately  to newly affiliated affiliated orthodontists during the first year of an orthodontic center s operations  which advances bear no interest and typically are repaid during the second year of the orthodontic center s operations 
the company is assisting affiliated orthodontists in obtaining financing from the company s primary lender to replace the company s financing of such affiliated orthodontists share of the costs of previously completed developments 
typically  when the company develops a new orthodontic center  all patients treated at the orthodontic center are new patients and  in the first several months after commencing operations  the orthodontic center is open only for a limited number of days each month as new patients are added 
the orthodontic centers have typically become increasingly more productive and profitable as more new patients are added and existing patients return for monthly follow up visits 
after months of operations  the orthodontic centers growth in patient base has typically begun to stabilize as the initial patients complete treatment 
an orthodontic center can increase the number of patients treated by improving the efficiency of its clinical staff and by adding operating days or orthodontists 
the orthodontic centers may also increase revenue by implementing periodic price increases 
established practices whose assets were acquired by the company have typically increased their revenue by applying the company s operating strategies  including increased advertising and efficient patient scheduling 
the financial statements of the company prior to october  recognized revenue as services were performed and the associated costs were incurred  in accordance with the proportional performance method of accounting for service contracts 
approximately of the orthodontic services were performed and their associated costs incurred in the first month of treatment 
accordingly  approximately of the revenue associated with a patient contract was historically recognized in the first month  with the remaining revenue recognized in equal monthly installments over the balance of the contract period  which averaged months 
expenses were recognized as incurred 
since october   the company earns its revenue from long term service or consulting agreements entered into with affiliated orthodontists 
pursuant to the service agreement  an affiliated orthodontist pays a fee to the company equal to approximately of new patient contract balances of the affiliated orthodontist in the first month of treatment plus the balance ratably over the remainder of the patient contract  less amounts retained by the affiliated orthodontist 
the amounts retained by an affiliated orthodontist are dependent on his or her financial performance  based in significant part on the affiliated orthodontist s profitability on a cash basis  as provided in the service agreements 
amounts retained by an affiliated orthodontist which operates a newly developed orthodontic center are typically reduced by operating losses on a cash basis because of start up expenses 
an affiliated orthodontist s share of these operating losses is added to the company s fee in the period during which the operating losses are incurred  while the affiliated orthodontist s share of capital expenditures is recovered through the company s fee over a period which approximates the useful life of the related capital assets 
in addition  a  annual fee is earned by the company for free standing orthodontic centers with respect to which long term agreements were entered into with the company in the combination transaction 
in exchange for its service fees  the company provides capital for the development and growth of orthodontic centers and manages the business and marketing aspects of orthodontic centers  including implementing advertising and marketing programs  preparing budgets  purchasing inventory  providing patient scheduling systems  billing and collecting fees and maintaining records 
operating expenses of the orthodontic centers are expenses of the company and are recognized as incurred 
the terms of consulting agreements differ significantly from the terms of service agreements and vary depending upon the regulatory requirements of the particular state in which an orthodontic center is located 
currently  in one state  the company may only provide consulting services to the orthodontists and may not manage the orthodontist s practice 
the consulting fee payable to the company is determined at the time of affiliation  is limited to compensation for the specific consulting services performed and is based on criteria such as the number of hours of operations of the applicable orthodontic centers 
employee costs consist of wages  salaries and benefits paid to all employees of the company  including orthodontic assistants  business staff and management personnel 
general and administrative expenses consist of provision for losses on patient contracts and receivables  professional service fees  maintenance and utility costs  office supply expense  telephone expense  taxes  license fees  and printing and shipping expense 
patient contracts are for terms averaging months and are payable in equal monthly installments throughout the term of treatment  except for the last month when a final payment is made
