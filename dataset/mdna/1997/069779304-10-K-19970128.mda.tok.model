item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s business plan and  consequently  its operating performance are predicated on the exploitation of its two major strengths  the development of safety critical software for the healthcare industry and the provision of safety critical software and hardware to the defense industry 
the company has been engaged since in the development of products for the regulated software industry and  most recently  computerized manufacturing execution systems mes for the pharmaceutical and medical device industry 
although no assurances can be given  the company believes the pharmaceutical and medical device market for computerized manufacturing execution systems is poised to grow rapidly over the next few years due to the pressure for compliance with regulations promulgated by the fda and the international standards organization iso in addition to the need to continuously reduce cost to remain competitive 
the company believes it has developed the premier standardized pc based system with the necessary functionality and documented support required by the pharmaceutical and medical device industry to assist it in reducing cost while remaining in compliance with fda and iso requirements and  although no assurances can be given  considers that its continuing investment in this evolving product area could provide it with a leadership position for this product with the potential for substantial growth and the expansion of its product opportunities into other regulated areas such as the food  cosmetic  and chemical industries 
the company has a history of success since as a supplier of safety critical hardware and software to the weapons control industry including the tornado interdiction and strike aircraft serving as a major weapon system for the german  italian and english defense forces and the a warthog ground support aircraft which is reported to have performed successfully in the gulf war 
this history has enabled the company to develop technology and personnel to position itself as a premier provider of products to that industry  a condition which was well illustrated in through the successful acquisition of three significant contracts with the potential for substantial production work over the next ten to fifteen years assuming government funding is available and current procurement plans remain unchanged  neither of which can be assured 
the company  which operates through a medical technology division and a government technology division  designs  develops  manufactures and markets complex precision electronic systems for the defense industry and comprehensive software solutions for the pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing industry 
many of the company s products are used in safety critical applications requiring consistent  highly reliable outcomes where any deviation from the defined outcome could have catastrophic results 
the company developed a core competency in safety critical applications from its historical focus  the development of electronic systems used primarily in weapons management systems 
the company is now applying this expertise to develop pharmasyst  and its next generation pharm  manufacturing execution systems targeted at the pharmaceutical manufacturing and medical device industry 
the defense business generated of the company s revenues during compared with in the company expects that the defense business will remain a significant component of operations 
the company experienced net losses of million in the year ended october  and 
million in the year ended october  these losses resulted primarily from reduction of defense related revenues  write offs and amortization of software development expenditures incurred in prior periods and expenses related to the marketing and sales of commercial products 
the company anticipates incurring additional losses in the first half of and could continue to incur losses in subsequent periods 
the company s ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon  among other things  successful marketing of its manufacturing execution system products and defense related design and manufacturing services  cost effective development of both medical and defense related products  and successful competition in the markets in which the company participates 
failure of the pharmasyst product to achieve market acceptance would have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
during the sales and marketing activity of the latter part of the company has found a need to provide detailed demonstrations of its products approximating actual customer needs 
in addition  the company believes that its manufacturing execution systems should be compliant with industry standards such as are described under good automated manufacturing practices gamp  an industry standard  and the company has found it very beneficial to upgrade its ability to comply with gamp and is  therefore  adding additional quality and project personnel 
these additions create expenses in advance of the revenues which they are intended to develop and act to increase losses until such revenues are generated when the generation of such revenues cannot be assured 
the company believes its objective of being the leading supplier of manufacturing execution systems mes to the pharmaceutical industry requires the incurrance of these costs and their consequences 
since the company believes there is a compelling need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to have mes compliant with cgmp and the company believes its products already lead the industry in their ability to comply with customer needs  the company considers the additional costs to be a prudent investment  although the company cannot be assured that pharmaceutical manufacturers may not find other ways to satisfy regulatory requirements 
the company believes that its potential for long term growth will depend in part on the success of its pharmasyst products and the ability to convert engineering contracts now underway in the defense related areas into profitable long term production contracts 
the installation of a manufacturing execution system is a complex process involving integration with existing hardware platforms and systems 
in addition  the system must undergo rigorous testing after installation and may require an extended period of modifications to fully comply with customer requirements some of which may be at company expense 
the company  from time to time  agrees to penalty clauses for delivery  some of which may be exercised with consequent reduction in revenue and negative impact on profitability 
for use in a manufacturing environment the system may have to undergo validation in accordance with defined procedures determining its fitness for use in a regulated environment 
the company now has one system installed and validated at a medical device manufacturing plant and is attempting to complete validation for additional systems 
pharmasyst customers are provided the right to cancel at no cost early in the contract cycle if the parties do not agree on the applicable specifications for the pharmasyst software to be installed 
some deliveries of pharmasyst products are overdue  and other deliveries may become overdue 
although cancellation for late deliveries may occur  and two already have occurred  the company does not anticipate the loss of material orders as a result thereof 
the company has devoted substantial resources to the development of its pharmasyst products including the development of pharm and has only delivered a limited number of applications 
substantially  all of the company s orders for defense related products may be canceled at any time  subject to various payment obligations for prior deliveries 
the company s weapons control products are used to prevent the undemanded release of a weapon 
its pharmaceutical manufacturing customers would employ pharmasyst products for  among other things  quality control and compliance with cgmp and other regulatory requirements 
the company maintains product liability insurance of at least million for commercial products and million for defense related products in the event a claim is made that the company s products failed to prevent defects in pharmaceutical products which resulted in injury to consumers or that its defense related products resulted in injury to persons or property 
there can be no assurances that the company s existing insurances would be adequate to cover any claims or that the company will be able to obtain and maintain adequate insurances in the future 
the company has generally accounted for substantially all its revenues using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenues are recognized for each period based upon the portion of a contract completed during such period  with customer invoicing and payments often occurring on a different cycle 
as a result  accounts receivable and revenues include work that has been completed  but that has not been billed 
this approach is applicable for custom development or manufacturing projects 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company determined that its pharm product had recently become standardized 
since most orders for this product did not meet the criteria for long term contract accounting  the company determined that it should recognize revenues from product orders  generally on delivery 
research and development for defense related projects is performed under development contracts with prime contractors under which the company generally receives full or partial funding 
funding under these contracts are accounted for as revenues 
software development expenditures are expensed as research and development until a product attains technological feasibility 
thereafter  expenditures are capitalized until products attain commercial viability 
the company established technological feasibility for pharmasyst in which  at the end of  had a capitalized value of million after allowing for amortization 
development expenditures for pharmasyst and other commercial products have consisted primarily of salaries of software engineers and quality assurance staff plus applicable allocated overhead 
the amortization period for pharmasyst is a maximum of four years 
in the second quarter of fiscal the company reviewed the recoverability of its capitalized software costs and determined that neither prenval  nor the product marketed as upacs would achieve sufficient revenues in future periods to justify retention of the related capitalized costs 
accordingly  the company wrote off the million balance of such capitalized costs 
with respect to prenval  it became apparent to the company that market acceptance of the product was less than anticipated 
the company also determined that the licensee had no current plans to market the product in the us as was originally anticipated by the company and that  as a result  sales would not exceed the amount necessary to generate royalties in excess of the minimum provided under the license 
effective as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  management resolved to suspend further development of prenval 
however  the company will provide technical and marketing support for the remainder of the license term 
with respect to upacs  the company had implemented sales efforts in late and displayed the product at certain trade shows in europe 
in december  sales were anticipated for early however  by early april it became clear that the anticipated sales would not materialize 
the company concluded that the product  as it existed  would not generate sufficient sales to recover the capitalized costs  and that only a new product designed for networking with communications and off line measurement capabilities would be capable of producing acceptable sales volume 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the company incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of 
million in losses in comprised a write off of various capitalized expenses in the sum of million representing development of the company s prenatal abnormality detection software  prenval  and early development costs for upacs and other operating losses of million 
the major portion of the operating loss represents the company s investment in the development of markets and infrastructure for medical technology division products 
included in the loss was approximately 
million of expenses incurred in the preparation of a registration prospectus which was withdrawn 
revenues for the twelve months ended october  were million compared with million in  a decrease of 
in addition to minimal revenues from its medical technology division  the decrease is attributable to a decline in defense spending resulting in fewer opportunities to bid with the consequent reduction in contract awards 
anticipated orders for the company s bus interface unit did not materialize and other orders for build to print contracts were million in compared with million in new business in the form of engineering contracts for maintenance data recorders and interference blanking units received from mcdonnell douglas in the middle of the year resulted in revenues during the third and fourth quarters only 
engineering contracts for both software and hardware development of defense related products accounted for approximately of revenues 
production of proprietary weapons control products for international customers accounted for approximately of revenues and production of proprietary and build to print defense related products for national customers accounted for approximately of revenues 
medical technology products accounted for approximately of revenues  with the balance of revenues derived from miscellaneous sources 
revenues from the medical technology division products declined from million in to million in in  million in revenue was recognized upon completion of the company s prenval software sold and licensed to johnson johnson ortho clinical diagnostic systems  with approximately 
million in revenue from the company s pharmasyst products 
the company began to recognize revenue only upon delivery of pharmasyst products at the end of the fiscal second quarter and consequently these products produced only minimal revenue in the third and fourth quarters 
cost of sales as a percent of revenues was in compared with in the increase is due primarily to overhead expenses for the development of pharmasyst 
these additional expenses  in the absence of appreciable revenues  increased cost of sales as a percent of revenues 
increases in staffing levels for the medical technology division included project management staff and the indirect costs of the larger development and testing groups 
direct labor increased from million in to in due primarily to increases in the development and testing staff dedicated to the pharmasyst project 
research and development costs increased to million from 
million in these charges which represent investments in defense related products are separate from the million in capitalized costs for the development of pharmasyst products in capitalized costs in of million consisted primarily of development costs for pharmasyst and upacs  both medical technology division products 
efforts to accelerate the market development of pharmasyst and upacs were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses rather than research and development costs 
selling  general and administrative costs for increased to million compared with million in included in the expenses are the costs of financing totaling 
million incurred in the preparation of a registration prospectus in anticipation of a prospective public offering 
the offering was withdrawn in july because of market conditions 
the company did not have comparable costs in the amortization of capitalized expenses relating primarily to the development of pharmasyst and upacs increased to million in from 
million in additional costs in  attributable largely to the medical technology division  for personnel hiring  travel  advertising  and consulting amounted to an increase of approximately 
million compared to the largest single increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for was in personnel costs rising from million in to million in this increase includes additional sales persons and also was attributable to the fact that in senior managers waived a portion of their salaries in the amount of approximately 
million 
this practice did not occur in interest expense in was 
million representing primarily capitalized lease costs incurred under a sale and lease back transaction involving sale of the company s facility in trenton  new jersey in october and less than three months interest costs applicable to the million convertible debenture issued in august  interest expenses in of 
million represented the capitalized lease costs and the mortgage loan outstanding during cost increases in personnel and related costs which were incurred in were incurred over only a part of the year and may be expected to increase in as they become applicable to the full year 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues declined by  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenues from defense related operations declined by million  or  from million to million 
revenues from commercial operations were million in there were no commercial revenues in the decline in defense revenues reflects reduced defense budgets in the us and western europe and was partially offset by a million increase in contract manufacturing revenues related to the commencement of a manufacturing contract 
defense revenues accounted for and of total revenues during and  respectively 
revenues from commercial operations consisted of royalties generated from sales of prenata and  of initial sales of pharmasyst 
during  the company licensed certain medical screening technology to johnson johnson clinical diagnostic systems for use in its prenata medical screening kit and entered into a corresponding five year royalty agreement 
using the percentage of completion method  the company recognized revenues of million in  representing the aggregate minimum royalty payments due under the agreement 
commercial product revenues accounted for of total revenues during cost of sales declined by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the decline was attributable to the decline in total revenues 
gross margin increased from to 
this increase is attributable to approximately million of sales of relatively high margin prenata and pharmasyst products during selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 
million  or  from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of revenues from to 
this increase consisted primarily of i 
million in salaries relating to the addition of new sales personnel  ii 
million in advertising of commercial products and iii 
million in travel expenses relating to the addition of new sales people and increased participation in trade shows 
the increase was partially offset by a 
million decrease in officers salary expense relating to a cost reduction program implemented in fiscal and a 
million decrease in employee group insurance expenses relating to the adoption of a new plan 
research and development expenses declined by  or  from  in to  in and remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenues 
capitalization of software development costs increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in this increase consisted primarily of   and  in increased capitalization of development costs relating to pharmasyst  upacs and a weapons control system  respectively  partially offset by lower development costs related to prenval 
interest expense increased by  or  from 
million in to 
million in and increased as a percentage of revenues from to 
this increase was primarily due to the mortgage interest being replaced in by capital lease amortization pursuant to the october sale and leaseback of the company s principal facility resulting in higher levels of borrowings 
the company s revenues and operating results are subject to significant quarterly fluctuations 
factors that could cause such fluctuations include the time of revenue recognition  changes in customer capital and resource commitment  changes in product mix  the introduction of new products or product improvements by the company or its competitors  fda regulation requirements and changes in operating expenses 
the timing of revenues from defense related programs can be significantly affected by government procurement processes and disruptions due to political and other events over which the company has no control 
the timing of revenues from manufacturing execution systems can be affected by factors outside the company s control  including long sales cycles and delays in customer authorization procedures 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company used million of cash in its operations 
the use of cash was due primarily to an increase of million in accounts receivable  the company s expenditure of approximately million for the development of its pharmasyst products  and the company s net loss for the year 
during fiscal  the company raised million from the sale of a convertible debenture maturing in and  from the exercise of outstanding options 
during fiscal  the company s cash and equivalents increased approximately 
million from million at october  to million at october   primarily due to million of cash generated by financing activities  partially offset by million of cash used in operations and million of additions to property  plant and equipment 
the company s net loss of million for the year ended october  included noncash expenses consisting of a write off of capitalized software development costs aggregating approximately million and additional write offs of 
million relating to other costs and capitalized items  as well as depreciation and amortization expense of million for the period  including million in amortization of capitalized software development costs 
the company believes that cash generated by operations and existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through the end of fiscal providing it receives substantial orders for its commercial products 
the company is relying on the completion of its medical technology division leading product  pharm  during the first quarter of calendar to stimulate new orders and permit the delivery of existing orders 
existing orders are expected to begin to generate cash within approximately days of delivery and new orders are expected to generate initial cash receipts within days of order with the balance within days after delivery 
neither the completion of pharm nor the consequential generation of cash can be assured either in time or amount or that such amounts will be sufficient for the company s needs 
in the absence of such orders or the promise thereof  neither of which can be assured  the company may elect to seek additional sources of capital and may also elect to reduce the pace of its development of medical technology division products or establish other cost reduction measures  which could adversely impact the company 
in the event the company elects to seek additional capital there can be no assurance that such funds or capital would be available
