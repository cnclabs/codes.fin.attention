item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results of operations may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such difference include those noted in this form k and in the company s prospectus dated march  incorporated by reference 
overview since its inception  femrx  inc  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its opera star system and related products 
the opera star system is an innovative surgical system for the diagnosis and treatment of gynecologic disorders 
opera stands for out patient endometrial resection ablation 
opera is a less invasive alternative to hysterectomy for patients suffering from abnormal uterine bleeding 
opera consists of diagnosis by a gynecologic surgeon and the use of the company s opera star resectoscope under visual guidance to collect a pathology sample  resect the endometrial lining together with any submucosal fibroids and coagulate the entire uterine cavity 
the company has also developed a proprietary fluid management system  called the flo stat system  for use in gynecologic procedures 
in march  the company obtained clearance from the fda to market the opera star system in the us in may  the company obtained clearance from the fda to market the flo stat system in the us the company s primary near term commercial products  the opera star system and the flo stat system have generated limited sales to date 
the company commenced commercial shipments of its opera star system and flo stat system in october the company currently sells its products in the united states to physicians and hospitals 
sales in the us are currently made through a small direct sales force and are conducted on open credit terms 
certain components of the company s products are manufactured by contract manufacturers 
additional manufacturing  final assembly and test is performed by the company at its location in sunnyvale  california 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company expects to continue to generate substantial losses due to increased operating expenditures primarily attributed to research and development activities  including clinical trials  and establishing commercial manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
the company anticipates that its research and development expenses will increase in the future to support increased product development activities  including clinical trials  and that its selling  general and administrative expenses will increase due to increased marketing and sales activities 
the company expects that its results of operations will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including the timing of such expenditures  timing in the receipt of orders  the rate of acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace  introduction of new products by competitors of the company  pricing of competitive products and the cost and effect of promotional discounts and marketing programs 
the company s gross margins  if any  will be depressed for several quarters due to initial manufacturing and overhead costs allocated over low production volumes 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenue or profitability 
results of operations years ended december    and net sales were  for the year ended december   due to the commercial release of the company s products in october of no net sales were recorded in any prior periods 
cost of goods sold was  for the year ended december   primarily consisting of costs related to initial manufacturing 
research and development expenses  which include clinical  regulatory  and prior to october   costs related to manufacturing start up increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   and from  for the year ended december  the increased amounts were primarily attributable to costs associated with clinical trials  additional product research  prototype development  patent preparation and filing  manufacturing facility preparation  and costs including the hiring of regulatory  research  clinical  engineering and manufacturing personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses  increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   and from  for the year ended december  the increased amounts were primarily attributable to the establishment of the company s sales and marketing organization  increased sales activity  related supplies and materials  and the costs related to the hiring of additional personnel 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  there was no interest income for the year ended december  the increase was due to the company s higher average balances in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments from the proceeds of the company s initial public offering which were received at the end of march  and from the underwriters exercise of their option for additional shares from which proceeds were received at the end of april interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  there was no interest expense for the year ended december  interest expense is due to interest payments on higher outstanding balances on an equipment lease line established during at december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  at various dates beginning in and continuing through utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  such annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses prior to utilization 
liquidity and capital resources in march and april  the company sold a total of  shares of common stock at per share through its initial public offering 
the net proceeds after underwriting discounts and expenses to the company from the initial public offering were  as of december  the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  the company also has a  leaseline of which  was available for borrowing on december  cash used in the company s operations increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   and from  for the year ended december  this cash was used primarily to fund increasing levels of research and development of the company s products  clinical and regulatory activities  start up of manufacturing operations  establishment of the company s sales and marketing organization  increased sales activity  and the costs related to the hiring of additional personnel 
capital expenditures increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  there were no capital expenditures for the year ended december  the increased level of capital expenditures during was due primarily to the company s increased operations throughout the year and the start up of its manufacturing operations 
the company plans to finance its capital needs principally from the net proceeds of its initial public offering and interest thereon 
the company believes that its existing cash will be sufficient to finance its capital requirements through at least the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the resources necessary to develop  manufacture and market products and the cost of obtaining and enforcing patents important to the company s business 
the company may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms to the company  or at all 
additional factors that may affect future results dependence on opera star system and flo stat system the opera star system and flo stat system are currently the company s only products 
the company expects that the opera star system  and to a lesser extent  the flo stat system  will account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
even though the opera star system and flo stat system have received fda clearance  there can be no assurance that the company can successfully manufacture  market  or realize any significant revenues from these products on a timely basis 
the company s products will require further development and regulatory clearances or approvals before they can be marketed internationally 
there can be no assurance that the company s development and marketing efforts will be successful or that the opera star system  flo stat system or other potential products developed by the company will be capable of being manufactured in commercial quantities at acceptable costs 
failure to manufacture in commercial quantities at acceptable cost the opera star system and flo stat system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of market acceptance the company believes that market acceptance of the company s products will depend  in part  on the company s ability to provide evidence to the medical community of the safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of its products and the procedures in which these products are intended to be used 
to date  the opera star system has only been used to treat a limited number of patients and no published reports regarding the use of the opera star system exist to support the company s marketing effort 
furthermore  there is little long term follow up data on patients who underwent opera using the opera star system 
if the company is not able to demonstrate long term success with the opera star system  market acceptance would be materially adversely affected 
the company s opera star system is designed for use by a gynecologic surgeon trained in the opera procedure 
market acceptance of the company s products will require a willingness on the part of gynecologic surgeons to be trained to perform opera using the company s products 
furthermore  market acceptance may be limited because some physicians and payors  recognizing that the removal of the uterus in a hysterectomy precludes the potential reoccurrence of uterine disorders  will be reluctant to substitute the opera procedure which allows the patient to retain her uterus for hysterectomy 
the company believes that most gynecologists view hysterectomy as an appropriate therapy to treat a variety of uterine disorders 
as a result  the company believes that recommendations and endorsements of its products by influential physicians will be essential for market acceptance of its products 
no assurances can be made that the company will receive such recommendations or endorsements 
the company further believes that the ability of health care providers to obtain adequate reimbursement for opera procedures using the opera star system will be critical to market acceptance of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the cost of procedures in which the opera star system is used will be adequately reimbursed by third party payors under existing reimbursement policies and codes 
the company has no experience in gaining reimbursement in the us or any foreign market 
the company expects to price its disposable resectoscope at a premium over the prices currently charged for the disposable components of competitive resectoscopes 
therefore  the company anticipates that it may have to offer substantial discounts on its opera star system motor drive unit in order to stimulate demand for its products 
the failure of the company to place sufficient quantities of its motor drive unit would have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell the disposable star 
another factor that may limit the market acceptance of the company s opera star system is that it is not currently compatible with all telescopes utilized in gynecologic surgery and therefore might require surgeons using incompatible telescopes to acquire a different telescope in order to use the opera star system 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited operating experience the company has a limited history of operations 
since its incorporation in november  the company has focused primarily on research and product development efforts  clinical trials and seeking regulatory clearance or approval for the opera star system and flo stat system 
the company has never generated significant revenues  and has limited experience manufacturing in commercial quantities  marketing or selling products 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since inception and expects these losses to continue for the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in commercializing the opera star system and flo stat system 
whether the company can successfully manage the transition to a large scale commercial enterprise will depend upon a number of factors  including obtaining selected international regulatory and reimbursement approvals for its existing or potential products  establishing its commercial manufacturing capability  developing its us marketing and selling capabilities  and establishing a distribution network in international markets 
failure to make such a transition successfully would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
