product sales of million in fiscal increased million or versus fiscal sales of million  which in turn decreased million or from fiscal sales of million 
the million increase in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to an increase in revenue from direct sales of contigen r implant contigen implant to physician customers by cr bard  inc bard  the company s marketing partner for contigen implant  an increase in international sales of plastic surgery and dermatological products including injectable collagen products  trilucent implant and hylaform gel  and an increase in domestic sales of plastic surgery and dermatological products including injectable collagen products  partially offset by a decrease in sales of collagraft bone graft products to the company s marketing partner  zimmer 
the million decrease in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in shipments of contigen implant  partially offset by a million increase in worldwide sales of plastic surgery and dermatological products 
worldwide sales of plastic surgery and dermatological products in fiscal were million or higher than fiscal sales of million  compared to a increase in fiscal from fiscal sales of million 
the million increase in worldwide sales of plastic surgery and dermatological products in fiscal resulted from an increase in units sold  partially offset by decreases in average sales prices 
the company believes that the improved unit sales performance in fiscal over fiscal resulted from the implementation of marketing programs in the united states designed to increase average treatment volume per patient for injectable collagen products and to attract and retain new and existing patients  the addition of hylaform gel  which was launched in europe in november  and strong distributor sales 
the company believes that the sales growth in its plastic surgery and dermatological products in fiscal resulted from increased demand by consumers for a wide variety of aesthetic procedures and continued physician interest in cosmetic procedures not reimbursed by third party payers 
the million increase in worldwide sales of plastic surgery and dermatological products in fiscal page over fiscal resulted from a increase in units sold  partially offset by a decrease of in average sales prices 
the company believes that the increase in unit sales in fiscal over fiscal resulted from strong distributor sales  especially in japan  successful international marketing and public relations efforts by the company s subsidiaries  the launch of new syringe configurations  and continued improvement of economic conditions in europe 
the implementation of united states marketing programs designed to both increase average treatment volume per patient and to attract and retain new and existing patients  favorably impacted overall unit sales in fiscal exchange rates unfavorably impacted international sales in united states dollars by million in fiscal and favorably affected international sales by  and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company anticipates continued growth in worldwide sales of plastic surgery and dermatological products in united states dollars during fiscal revenue recorded from contigen implant sales was million in fiscal or higher than fiscal sales of million  which in turn decreased million or from fiscal sales of million 
revenue recorded from contigen implant sales over the three year period included years ended june  in millions shipments of contigen implant to bard income from bard s direct sales to physician customers the million increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to the resumption of shipments of contigen implant to bard during the fourth quarter of fiscal in accordance with the company s sales agreement with bard 
the million decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to minimal shipments made to bard as a result of significant inventory levels of contigen implant held by bard at the end of fiscal in fiscal  the health care financing administration hcfa made several favorable changes to the rules under which an incontinence patient can be reimbursed by medicare for treatment with contigen implant 
hcfa also raised the reimbursement amount to physicians for each contigen implant syringe administered 
because hcfa policies are generally adopted by private insurance companies  these changes may have a positive effect on coverage by private insurers 
the company believes that the outcome of these changes will allow more patients to have treatment with contigen implant paid for by their insurer  resulting in increased revenues recorded in the future by the company from contigen implant sales 
in addition  the company expects that revenues from contigen implant sales in fiscal will increase as a result of the resumption of shipments of contigen implant to bard 
sales of collagraft bone graft products in fiscal were million or lower than fiscal sales of million  compared to a  increase in fiscal from fiscal sales of million 
the million decrease in fiscal over fiscal was due to lower sales by zimmer and a consequent decrease in shipments from the company 
the company expects sales and shipments of collagraft bone graft products for fiscal to approximate the same level as fiscal a number of uncertainties exist surrounding the marketing and distribution of contigen implant and collagraft bone graft products 
the company s primary means of distribution for these products is through third party firms bard  in the case of contigen implant  and zimmer  in the case of collagraft bone graft products 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected in the event that either or both of these parties are unable to market the products effectively  anticipate customer demand accurately  or effectively manage industry wide pricing and cost containment pressures in health care 
page other revenue 
other revenue in fiscal years and consisted of milestone payments of million and million  respectively  from bard in accordance with the company s agreement with bard 
the final milestone payment of million was paid to the company on september  cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of product sales averaged in both fiscal years and  due primarily to a lower per unit cost in fiscal offset by an overall increase in units shipped 
cost of sales as a percentage of product sales averaged in fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was due primarily to the inclusion of start up manufacturing costs for trilucent implant 
unit cost of manufacturing collagen based injectable products was considerably higher in fiscal than in fiscal due to decreased production volumes  primarily for contigen implant 
due to the high fixed costs of the company s manufacturing facility  unit cost of manufacturing collagen based injectable products is expected to remain highly dependent on the level of output at the company s manufacturing facility and accordingly  on the demand for collagen based injectable products 
in addition  cost of sales as a percentage of product sales is contingent on the product mix of future sales  for which demand and pricing characteristics may vary 
the company anticipates that cost of sales as a percentage of sales will increase slightly as a result of introducing new product line extensions  with higher costs per unit  partially offset by lower manufacturing costs per unit for collagen based injectable products 
sg a 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing   and of product sales  respectively 
the million  or  increase in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to payments made to the company s former chief executive officer  howard palefsky  in accordance with mr

palefsky  legal expenses incurred in connection with the matrix lawsuit  and higher international sales and marketing costs associated with additional launches of trilucent implant and commercial introduction of hylaform gel

palefsky during fiscal and fiscal totaling  and  respectively

purchased in process research and development

excluding these acquisition related  non recurring r d charges  operating income would have been approximately  in fiscal additionally  the decrease in operating income in fiscal was to a large extent due to the inclusion of the operating expenses of lipomatrix subsequent to the acquisition in august and no shipments of contigen implant to bard in fiscal impact of foreign exchange rates

the company s effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the higher effective tax rate in fiscal primarily was due to the impact of non deductible items such as losses from foreign subsidiaries  the amortization of a full year of goodwill associated with the lipomatrix acquisition and equity losses in affiliates

the company has a million million swiss francs credit facility that was established by lipomatrix prior to the company s acquisition of lipomatrix  of which  million swiss francs remained unused as of june  the company s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance and demand for the company s products  the resources the company devotes to the development  manufacture and marketing of its products  the progress of the company s clinical research and product development programs  the extent to which the company enters into collaborative relationships with third parties and the scope of the company s obligations in such relationships  the receipt of  and the time required to obtain  regulatory clearances and approvals  the resources required to protect the company s intellectual property and other factors 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be accurately predicted 
funds may also be used for the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to those of the company 
the company believes that its current sources of liquidity should be adequate to fund its anticipated capital requirements through at least december  however  during this period or page thereafter  the company may require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms favorable to the company or at all 
factors that may affect future results of operations reliance on limited number of key products 
sales of the company s collagen based injectable products  zyderm r i collagen implant and zyderm r ii collagen implant collectively  zyderm implants and zyplast r implant zyplast implant  as well as trilucent implant and contigen implant  accounted for approximately of consolidated product sales for the fiscal year ended june  the company s product sales may continue to consist primarily of sales of these principal products 
factors such as adverse rulings by regulatory authorities  product liability lawsuits  introduction of competitive products by third parties  other loss of market acceptance or other adverse publicity for these principal products may significantly and adversely affect the company s sales of these products and  as a result  also adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial fluctuations in quarterly operating results  future operating results uncertain 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending upon factors such as the timing of significant orders and shipments  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  increased competition  demand for the company s products  the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of the company s products on a timely basis  the mix of direct and indirect sales  the timing of investments in affiliate companies and general economic factors  among others 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenue levels 
if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be materially adversely affected 
in particular  because only a small portion of the company s expenses varies with revenue in the short term  net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenue and operating results have been and will continue to be difficult to forecast 
based upon all of the foregoing  the company believes that quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenue will increase or be sustained in future periods or that the company will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of  or be able to confirm  such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  or following the end of the quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which may result in significant volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
manufacturing risks and inventory shortages 
certain of the company s products  including hylaform gel  softform implant and refinity skin solutions  are manufactured for the company by third parties 
as a result  the company is dependent on these third parties to manufacture and supply products to the company as required 
while the company has distribution agreements with these third parties  there can be no assurances that these third parties will manufacture and supply quality products on a timely basis or in adequate quantities 
any failure of these third parties to manufacture sufficient quantities of these products or to deliver products that meet the company s specifications or quality control standards would adversely affect the company s sales of these products  and as a result  could also adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company relies on a closed herd of cattle in order to produce its bovine collagen based products  including zyderm implants  zyplast implant and contigen implant 
in the event of any material diminution in the size of the company s herd for any reason  including accident or disease  the company would have a limited ability to quickly increase supply of acceptable cattle 
page any such diminution would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to sell bovine collagen based products and  as a result  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to lower its costs of manufacturing trilucent implant  the company is seeking to outsource the manufacture of the implant shells 
the company has only limited supply of breast implant shells 
therefore  any material delay or inability to outsource manufacture of the shells could limit the company s ability to meet customer requirements 
any failure to outsource shell manufacturing on a cost effective basis or to otherwise lower the manufacturing costs of trilucent implant on a timely basis or at all would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and increasing competition under the recent changes in the health care environment 
the company faces intense competition in each of its target product markets 
the company faces direct and indirect competition for its zyderm implants and zyplast implant products 
at the present time  there is a commercial product in the united states that is directly competitive with zyderm implants and zyplast implant  the company s collagen based products for plastic surgery and dermatology 
this product is a gelatin based denatured collagen injectable commercial product  presently being marketed in the united states and canada that is directly competitive with zyderm implants and zyplast implant 
the company also competes with products derived from human tissue 
collagenesis  inc produces a product requiring a biopsy of the patient s tissue  which tissue is then used to generate an injectable material 
fat injections require surgical removal of the patient s fatty tissue 
implantable cadaver tissue obtained through tissue banks is sold under the brand name alloderm and competes directly with the company s softform implant 
internationally  direct competitors in the injectable product segment have included both government approved and unapproved products which are primarily derived from collagen  hyaluronic acid and silicone 
the company is aware of one foreign company that is marketing internationally a collagen based material for soft tissue augmentation 
the company is aware of one company in europe that markets a hylauronic acid based product called restylane that is competitive with hylaform gel 
in addition  wl gore  inc markets an eptfe product that is directly competitive with softform implant 
the company s injectable collagen products also compete in the dermatology and plastic surgery markets with substantially different alternative treatments  such as laser treatments  chemical peels  fat injections  dermabrasion  botulinum toxin injections and face lifts 
the worldwide alpha hydroxy acid market in which refinity skin solutions compete is extremely competitive 
worldwide sales of alpha hydroxy acid products total approximately billion per year  with the medical segment of this market accounting for approximately to of this total 
large retailers and some door to door companies  as well as the prestige market  such as salon and department stores  participate in the alpha hydroxy market 
during the last two years  several large pharmaceutical companies with high product profiles within the dermatology market have purchased or solidified distribution agreements with alpha hydroxy skin care lines 
in addition  physicians dispense a significant number of private label in office peel and take home products 
the principal competitors of trilucent implant are saline implants worldwide  and silicone gel implants outside the united states  canada and france 
the company has identified mentor corporation mentor and mcghan medical corporation mcghan  which market both saline and silicone gel implants  as being the company s primary competitors for breast implants 
both companies have greater financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
at the present time  autologous fat  silicone micro implants and polytetrafluoroethylene teflon paste  or ptfe are directly competing with contigen implant for the treatment of stress incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency isd 
neither silicone micro implants nor ptfe have been approved by the fda for use in the united states 
other methods of treatment or amelioration of isd may be considered competitive with contigen implant 
these include surgery  medication  absorbent products and behavior modification 
page in addition  several companies and institutions are engaged in the development of collagen based and other materials  techniques  procedures and products for use in aesthetic and reconstructive applications anticipated to be addressed by the company s products 
some of these companies and institutions are developing human based collagen products which  when and if commercially introduced  would have certain competitive advantages over the company s bovine collagen based products  including increased biocompatibility 
some of these companies and institutions may have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities  experience in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing products than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any products that have been or may be developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive  or that the company will be able to compete effectively against such competitors based on its abilities to manufacture  market and sell its products 
there can be no assurance that such potential competition will not have an adverse effect on the future business or financial condition of the company 
see business competition 
some of these companies and institutions may have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities  and experience in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing products similar to those of the company 
these companies and institutions may represent significant long term competition for the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or may be developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete or non competitive or that the company will be able to compete effectively against such competitors based on its abilities to manufacture  market and sell its products 
there can be no assurance that such potential competition will not have an adverse effect on the future business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
risks associated with trilucent implant business 
the company has not yet commenced sales of its trilucent implant in the united states 
therefore  the company s strategy with respect to trilucent implant sales in the united states is unproven and subject to a number of risks 
the company has suspended enrollment in all clinical trials of trilucent implant until it is able to lower its costs of manufacturing trilucent implant and develop different versions of the implant 
if and when such clinical trials resume  there can be no assurance that the trials will be successfully completed or that they will not yield unfavorable clinical data which could prevent fda clearance of trilucent implant 
in particular  the company will be required to submit an investigational device exemption ide to the fda prior to recommencing clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that the ide would be granted 
any failure of the company to complete development  obtain regulatory approval and successfully market the trilucent implant  in the united states  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are a number of uncertainties relating to the manufacturing and marketing of breast implants  including how long such implants last in the human body and the biocompatibility of implant fillers 
in particular  while the soybean oil based implant filler in trilucent has been used in intravenous feeding  there is only limited animal data regarding the effect on the release of large amounts of such material into the human body 
the biocompatibility data obtained by the company to date is based on animal studies using peanut oil 
there can be no assurance that long term clinical or other data will be favorable in this regard 
other manufacturers of breast implants have been the subject of sizable product liability judgments 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to products liability claims in the future regarding the trilucent implant 
rapid technological change 
the company s industry is characterized by ongoing technological developments  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements 
for example  during the past few years  manufacturers of breast implants have changed the filler material from silicone to saline 
the company s success depends and will depend upon its ability to continue to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that take advantage of technological advances  to identify and adhere to emerging standards  and to continue to improve the functionality of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis or at all  competitive products  product page enhancements and new products that respond to technological change  changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards  or that the company s enhanced or new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
the inability of the company  due to resource constraints  technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
undeveloped and uncertain markets 
certain of the company s products are intended for use in new markets the size of which are difficult to independently verify 
in particular  the potential market for the company s contigen implant product is difficult to estimate because contigen implant represents a relatively new method of treatment  and the company believes that most sufferers of stress urinary incontinence do not seek medical treatment 
bard markets contigen implant exclusively to urologists  who may not be the only physicians treating this disorder 
should the markets for such products be more limited than the company or its marketing partners currently estimate  or should the company  its distributors and or its marketing partners fail to penetrate such markets to the extent anticipated  the company may experience lower than anticipated revenues and a resulting adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on marketing partners and third party distributors  effect of inventory fluctuations 
the company has entered into exclusive arrangements with bard for the marketing and distribution of contigen implant and with zimmer for the marketing and distribution of the collagraft bone graft products 
as a result  the company s revenues and earnings for these products depend almost entirely upon the continuing efforts of these marketing partners 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that either or both of these parties do not effectively market the company s products  accurately anticipate customer demand or effectively manage industry wide pricing and cost containment pressures in health care 
the company s revenues and earnings have in the past fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate based upon the levels of orders placed by these parties  which are in turn affected by the levels of sales by these distributors and the levels of their inventories 
at june   bard had a significant inventory of contigen implant and  as a result  took minimal shipments of such product during fiscal while shipments to bard resumed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  there can be no assurances that such shipments will continue 
the failure to continue shipments of contigen implant to bard during fiscal and any significant decrease in purchases of collagraft bone graft products by zimmer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company depends upon third party distributors to market its other products in a number of international markets 
there can be no assurance that any of such distributors will not cease operations or be unable to satisfy financial obligations to the company 
if a significant distributor were to fail to adequately promote the company s products or were to cease operations  such failure or cessation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation and adverse publicity 
the company s manufacturing activities and products sold in the united states other than refinity skin solutions are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in certain foreign countries where these products are manufactured or distributed 
the fda regulates the manufacture  clinical research and sale of medical devices  including labeling  advertising and record keeping 
in order to market products in the united states which are considered by the fda to be medical devices  the company will be required to receive k marketing clearance or premarket approval from the fda for such products among other regulatory requirements 
in order to obtain k marketing clearance  the company must show that the product is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device not requiring fda approval 
in addition  the company must demonstrate that it is capable of manufacturing the product to the relevant standards 
to obtain premarket approval of a product  the company must submit extensive data  including pre clinical and clinical trial data to prove the safety and efficacy of the product 
clinical trials are normally done in three phases over two to five years  but may take longer to complete as a result of many factors  including slower than anticipated patient enrollment  difficulty in finding a sufficient number of patients fitting the appropriate trial profile  page difficulty in the acquisition of sufficient supply of clinical trial materials or adverse events occurring during the trials 
the company s primary products are currently classified as class iii medical devices  which require premarket approval from the fda 
there can be no assurance that the fda will not choose to characterize future products of the company as drugs or biologics rather than medical devices  which have additional requirements for approval 
any such change in fda characterization would potentially lengthen and increase the cost of the approval process 
while the company s other primary products have been approved for sale in the united states  neither trilucent implant nor hylaform gel have been approved for domestic commercial sale 
in particular  the company has suspended enrollment in united states clinical trials for trilucent implant until it is able to lower manufacturing costs and develop different versions of the implant 
fda review of trilucent implant will therefore not recommence until after such clinical trials resume and clinical data supporting a premarket approval application is generated 
in order to recommence united states clinical trials for trilucent implant  the company will be required to submit an ide to the fda 
there can be no assurance that such ide will be granted 
there also can be no assurance that clinical trials for trilucent implant  if recommenced  will be completed or that the data from such clinical trials will be sufficient to support a premarket approval application 
medical products whose market applications have not yet been approved by the fda may be exported only with the specific approval of the fda 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
in addition  government regulations may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
furthermore  compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations is necessary to receive fda approval to market new products and to continue to market current products 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals and clearances is lengthy and will require the expenditure of substantial capital and resources 
there can be no assurances that the company or its suppliers will be able to obtain the necessary approvals for its products  including trilucent implant and hylaform gel 
moreover  if and when such approval or clearance is obtained  the marketing  distribution and manufacture of such products would remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements administered by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
failures to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant approvals  premarket clearance or premarket approval  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
many of the company s products are marketed internationally and are therefore subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement  which vary from country to country and are becoming more restrictive throughout the eu 
the process of obtaining foreign regulatory approvals can be lengthy and require the expenditure of substantial capital and resources 
in particular  the company s softform implant is not approved for marketing in any international market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such approval for softform implant or for the company s other products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s refinity skin solutions line will not become subject to fda regulations or other foreign regulatory requirements 
any delay or failure by the company or its suppliers to obtain regulatory approvals for its products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the continuing trend of more stringent fda oversight in product clearance and enforcement activities has caused medical device manufacturers to experience longer approval cycles  more uncertainty  greater risk and higher expenses 
failure to obtain  or delays in obtaining  the required regulatory approvals for new products  particularly with respect to trilucent implant and hylaform gel  could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations  as could product recalls 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda will give approval to the company to market its current products for broader or different applications  or that it will grant approval with respect to separate product applications which represent extensions of the company s basic technology  or that existing approvals or market clearances will not be withdrawn 
further  page changes in governmental reimbursement systems  pursuant to which hospitals and physicians are reimbursed for medical procedures at a fixed rate according to diagnosis related groups or other reimbursements  could have an economic impact on the purchase and use of medical devices 
in particular  a material decrease in current reimbursement levels for contigen implant and its application in the treatment of intrinsic sphincter deficiency isd could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the collagen used in the company s products is derived from cow hides 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse is a disease  initially reported in cattle in the united kingdom  characterized by degenerative lesions of the central nervous system 
the source of infections in animals derives from eating infected sheep derived feed 
while the disease has been reported in european countries  the company is not aware of any reports of bse in united states cattle to date 
there can be no assurance that the various foreign or domestic regulatory authorities will not raise issues regarding bse or other matters which may adversely affect the company s ability to manufacture  market or sell its bovine collagen based products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in past years  the company has been the subject of legislative and regulatory investigations relating to  among other things  the safety and efficacy of its injectable collagen products 
there can be no assurance that legislative and regulatory investigations or negative publicity from such investigations or future investigations or from the news media will not result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  significant negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims 
risk of investments in affiliates 
the company has made significant equity and debt investments in affiliated companies that are involved in the development of complementary or related technologies or products  and the company currently intends to continue to make significant additional investments in such companies from time to time in the future 
these affiliated companies typically are in an early stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses 
as a result  the company has recorded and expects to continue to record a share of the losses in such affiliates attributable to the company s ownership  which losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any investments in affiliates will result in any return nor can there be any assurance as to the timing of any such return  or that the company will not lose its entire investment 
effect of ownership interest in boston scientific 
as of june   the company owned approximately  million shares of boston scientific common stock  valued at over million based on a market price of per share on such date 
the market price of boston scientific s common stock is highly volatile and  as a medical device manufacture  boston scientific is subject to a number of the same factors affecting its operations as the company  as well as additional factors not applicable to the company 
readers are encouraged to review boston scientific s public filings for a detailed understanding of the nature of boston scientific s business and the risk and uncertainties associated with it 
any significant downward fluctuation in the market price for boston scientific common stock could adversely impact the company s earnings due to lower returns per share on sales of such stock as well as the value of the company s total assets as stated on its balance sheet based on a lower carrying value for the boston scientific investment  which as of june   represented approximately of the value of the company s total assets 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company initiated a protect strategy for its investment in boston scientific common stock 
various market instruments will be utilized as part of this strategy  including the purchase of puts and calls either separately or in combination known as an equity collar 
the protect strategy is designed to minimize downside risk of loss should the stock price decline and allow for limited upside participation should the stock price rise 
however  there can be no assurance that the protect strategy will be successful or that the company will be able to sell shares of boston scientific common stock at attractive prices 
product liability  insurance 
the manufacture and sale of medical products entails significant risk of product liability claims due to disease transmission and other health factors  and product recalls 
the company is involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business  the majority of which involve product liability claims for personal injury allegedly caused by the page company s products 
any product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims alleging that the use of the company s technology or products has resulted in adverse effects  particularly with respect to claims regarding trilucent implant  which is sold in a medical field breast augmentation  reconstruction and replacement in which there have been sizable product liability claims 
such risks will exist even with respect to those products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
there can be no assurance that the company will avoid significant product liability claims and attendant negative publicity 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that present insurance coverage will be adequate or that adequate insurance coverage will remain available at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim or recall would not adversely affect the future business or financial condition of the company 
a successful claim brought against the company for which coverage is denied or in excess of its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  adverse product liability actions could negatively affect the company s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for its products 
patents and proprietary technology 
the company depends substantially upon its proprietary technological expertise in the extraction  purification  formulation and manufacturing of collagen based materials and other biomaterials into biomedical products 
the company seeks patents on inventions concerning novel manufacturing processes  compositions of matter  and applications for its proprietary biomaterials 
patent related litigation is a risk in the medical device industry 
there can be no assurance the company will be successful in the future in obtaining patents or license rights  that patents will be issued for the company s current patent applications  that the company will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable  that any issued patents will provide the company with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company 
no assurance can be given that the processes or products of the company or its licensors will not infringe patents or proprietary rights of others or that any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company does not obtain such licenses  it could encounter delays in product introductions while it attempts to design around such patents  or it could find that the manufacture  sale or use of products requiring such licenses could be enjoined 
in addition  the company could incur substantial costs in defending itself in suits brought against the company on such patents or in bringing suits to protect the company s patents against infringement 
in particular  although the company intends to seek international coverage for all patents held by it  the company s rights to one currently issued patent covering technology used in its trilucent breast implant extends only to the united states 
therefore  the company is not currently able to prevent others from using such technology disclosed in such patent outside of the united states 
page the company relies upon trade secret protection for certain unpatented aspects of its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques  that others will not otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary technology or disclose such technology  or that the company can meaningfully protect its trade secrets 
the company requires its employees and consultants to execute appropriate confidentiality and proprietary information agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationship with the company 
these agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual by the company during the course of the individual s relationship with the company is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties  except in specific circumstances 
the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to the company shall be the exclusive property of the company  however  certain of the company s agreements with consultants  who typically are employed on a full time basis by academic institutions or hospitals  do not contain assignment of invention provisions 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for the company in the event of unauthorized use  transfer or disclosure of such information or inventions 
impact of currency fluctuations  importance of foreign sales 
approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were derived from its international operations 
accordingly  any material decrease in foreign sales would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because international sales of the company s products typically are denominated in local currencies  the company s results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be affected by changes in exchange rates between certain foreign currencies and the united states dollar 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unfavorable currency fluctuation effects in future periods  which could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s operations and financial results also may be significantly affected by other international factors  including the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and difficulties in managing international operations 
the company plans to investigate hedging options in fiscal in order to minimize the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations on the company s operation results 
however  there can be no assurance that hedging options will favorably affect the company s results of operations 
use of hazardous materials 
the company s operations require the controlled use of hazardous materials 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an incident  the company could be held liable for any damages that result  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited diversity of facilities 
all of the company s manufacturing capacity for collagen products  the majority of its research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  and other critical business functions are located near major earthquake faults 
in addition  all of the company s manufacturing capacity for collagen based products and trilucent implant are located in two primary facilities one for collagen based products and one for trilucent implant  with the company currently maintaining only limited amounts of finished product inventory 
while the company has some limited protection in the form of disaster recovery programs and basic insurance coverage  the company s operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake  fire or other similar calamity affecting its manufacturing facilities 
third party reimbursement 
in the united states  hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third party payors  such as private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the treatment of patients 
the company s success will depend upon  among other things  its ability to obtain satisfactory reimbursement from healthcare payors for its products 
certain of the company s products  including contigen implant  collagraft bone graft products  and  in certain circumstances  trilucent implant  are purchased by hospitals or physicians in the united states  which then bill various third page party payors including medicare  medicaid and private insurers for the healthcare services provided to patients 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that the reimbursement of treatments using the company s products will not be subject to such challenges in the future 
given the efforts to control and decrease health care costs in recent years  there can be no assurance that any reimbursement will be sufficient to permit the company to maintain profitability 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
many international markets have government managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets  there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain reimbursement in any country within a particular time  for a particular amount  or at all 
failure to obtain such reimbursement approvals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
regardless of the type of reimbursement system  the company believes that physician advocacy of its products will be required to obtain reimbursement 
availability of reimbursement will depend on the clinical efficacy and cost of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for the company s products will be available in the united states or in international markets under either government or private reimbursement systems  or that physicians will support and advocate reimbursement for use of the company s systems for all uses intended by the company 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from health care payors or adverse changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent upon a limited number of key management and technical personnel  the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
any inability to attract and retain key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the foregoing factors are not meant to represent an exhaustive list of the risks and uncertainties attendant to the company s business 
due to the factors noted above  as well as other factors that may affect the company s operating results  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of  or be able to confirm  such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  or following the end of the quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock
