item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the registrant s primary focus is young  first time home buyers who already live and work in the area 
these buyers generally purchase their manufactured homes from retail sales centers to locate on property they own 
the registrant has aggressively pursued this market through its prestige retail sales centers  which have become the principal focus of its business strategy 
while the registrant actively seeks to make wholesale sales to independent retail dealers  the registrant s presence as a competitor limits potential sales in the same geographic areas serviced by its prestige sales centers 
the registrant continues to make sales to the retirement community market  which is made up of retirees from the north who move to florida to enjoy its milder winters and who typically purchase homes to be located on sites leased from park communities that offer a variety of amenities 
while a portion of the registrant s sales in this market are made to communities owned by the registrant s affiliate  tlt  the importance to the registrant of the retirement market continues to diminish  both as a focus of its efforts and in dollars and as percentage of total sales

the registrant has a product line of approximately active models 
market demand can fluctuate on a fairly short term basis  however  the manufacturing process is such that the registrant can alter its product mix relatively quickly in response to changes in the market 
during fiscal  the registrant s product mix was positively affected by larger  more expensive double wide and triple wide homes and better acceptance of the registrant s single wide homes both resulting from greater consumer confidence and the availability of varied types of financing at competitive rates 
many family buyers today purchase three or four bedroom manufactured homes  compared with the two bedroom home that typically appeals to the retirement community market 
in an effort to make manufactured homes more competitive with conventional housing  the outside financing sources that finance home purchases by prestige s customers continue to develop creative and attractive financing packages including year mortgages  an interest rate reduction program  combination land manufactured home loans  and a down payment program for qualified buyers
