as a result  the company expects development expenditures to increase 
the company estimates that a significant portion of its future commitments for proposed development expenditures will relate to xyrem 
in order to limit its potential financial commitment on this product  the company is currently exploring several options that could reduce the company s future cash funding requirements for this product 
the company believes that it has sufficient capital to fund its operations through the first half of the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on  among other factors  the extent to which the company s fda approved products gain market acceptance  the timing of regulatory actions regarding future products  the costs and timing of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  the results of clinical trials and competition 
however  to fully implement the company s current business plan through  the company believes it will need to raise at least  of additional capital  assuming no internally generated funding is available 
the company s future capital requirements take into account the expected delay in the market introduction and the added development costs resulting from the fda s requirement to broaden clinical data to be submitted with the nda for busulfanex  as well as the development costs for the new products the company licensed during the company currently has no assurance that such capital will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
in the event that the company is unable to raise additional capital on a timely basis  it expects to reduce or defer the amount allocated to planned development activities of its current products
