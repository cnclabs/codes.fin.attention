item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled purchasing and distribution  competition  and risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended february   and the risk factors section contained in the prospectus to the company s registration statement on form s commission file no 
 an updated copy of which was filed with the commission on march  general at february   petsmart operated superstores in north america and superstores in the united kingdom 
net sales grew for the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended january  fiscal 
excluding the fifty third week in fiscal  net sales increased over fiscal comparable store sales for the north american stores  excluding the fifty third week  increased for the year  and increased for the company s united kingdom stores 
the company believes that comparable store sales increases have been largely due to increased customer traffic and to improvements in its merchandising and marketing activities 
in view of the increasing maturity of its superstore base  as well as the opening of additional superstores in existing markets  the company anticipates that its rate of comparable store sales growth may be lower in future periods than previously reported 
the company also expects that future increases in net sales and net income  if any  will be somewhat dependent on the opening and profitability of new superstores 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve its planned expansion on a timely and profitable basis or that the combined operations and recent mergers with petstuff  sporting dog  pet food giant  state line tack and pet city will be successful or that there will be no material adverse effects on the financial results of the company from the efforts to integrate the above acquisitions 
as a result of its expansion plans  the company anticipates certain costs  such as preopening expenses and occupancy  may increase as a percentage of sales in the near term 
in addition  the timing of new superstore openings and related preopening expenses and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing superstores may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
since new superstores have higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature superstores  the level of recent new superstore openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins 
during fiscal  the company anticipates opening at least superstores in north america  including stores in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal  to stores in the second quarter of fiscal  and to stores in the united kingdom 
in addition  the company charges preopening costs associated with each new superstore to earnings when the superstore is opened 
therefore  the company expects that the opening of large numbers of new superstores in a given quarter will adversely impact its quarterly results of operations for that quarter 
the company s business also is subject to some seasonal fluctuation 
historically  the company has realized a higher portion of its net sales during the month of december and a lower portion of its net sales during the summer months 
petsmart s superstores typically draw from a large retail area and can therefore be impacted by adverse weather and travel conditions 
sales of certain of the company s products and services designed to address seasonal flea and tick problems may also be negatively impacted by the introduction of new alternative treatments  as well as by weather conditions that are not favorable to the development of fleas and ticks 
in may  petsmart acquired sporting dog  a catalog retailer of pet and animal supplies and accessories 
although the results of sporting dog were accretive to fiscal earnings and not dilutive on petsmart s fiscal operating results  there can be no assurance that sporting dog can maintain its profitability 
in june  petsmart acquired superstores in the eastern united states and four superstores in canada from petstuff 
during the second quarter  of the redundant and non productive superstores  including all of the canadian stores  were closed 
as of february   a total of redundant or nonproductive former petstuff superstores had been closed 
the company has completed the integration of the remaining petstuff superstores  including changing the merchandise mix and operating and marketing philosophies 
the petstuff acquisition was dilutive to fiscal operating results and accretive to fiscal earnings  and petsmart expects the acquisition to contribute to earnings in fiscal  however  there can be no assurance these superstores can achieve their anticipated profitability 
in september  petsmart acquired pet food giant  an operator of pet food and supply superstores in the new jersey  long island and philadelphia metropolitan areas 
as of february   one redundant superstore had been closed 
the company has completed the process of integrating the pet food giant stores into the petsmart format  including changing the merchandise mix and operating and marketing philosophies 
the pet food giant stores were not dilutive to fiscal earnings  however  there can be no assurance that pet food giant can achieve its anticipated profitability 
on january   petsmart completed the acquisition of state line tack  the leading worldwide catalog operator specializing in discount brand name tack  riding apparel and equine supplies 
although state line tack was accretive to earnings in fiscal  there can be no assurance that state line tack can maintain its profitability 
on december   the company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of pet city  the largest pet industry specialty retailer in the united kingdom 
as of february   the company was in the process of integrating the pet city stores into the petsmart format  including changing the tradename  modifying the merchandise mix and implementing petsmart s operating and marketing philosophies 
although petsmart does not expect the results of pet city to be dilutive to fiscal operating results  there can be no assurance that pet city can achieve its anticipated profitability 
the discussion below relates to the results of operations of petsmart reflecting the mergers with petstuff  sporting dog  pet food giant  state line tack  and pet city as if they had taken place from the inception of petsmart 
all of these acquisitions have been accounted for as poolings of interests 
additionally  all share and per share data have been restated to reflect the company s for stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on july  to stockholders of record on july   and a for stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on may  to stockholders of record on april  results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales  unless otherwise indicated  of certain items included in the company s statements of operations totals may not add to due to rounding fiscal fiscal fiscal statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit store operating expenses store preopening expenses general and administrative expenses merger and business integration costs operating income loss interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to approximately billion for fiscal from approximately billion for the fiscal excluding the fifty third week in fiscal  net sales increased over fiscal comparable store sales for the north american stores  excluding the fifty third week  increased for fiscal  as compared to an increase of for fiscal  excluding the petstuff and pet food giant stores  some of which were closed for retrofitting during the year 
due to the increasing maturity of its superstore base  as well as the opening of additional superstores in existing markets  the company anticipates that its rate of comparable store sales growth may be lower in future periods than previously reported 
comparable store sales for the united kingdom stores increased for fiscal during fiscal  the company opened new superstores  including in the united kingdom  and relocated three superstores 
net sales from the superstores opened in fiscal contributed million or of the total increase in net sales 
of the remainder of the total net sales increase  million or was contributed by superstores opened in fiscal the company had superstores in operation at the end of fiscal compared to superstores open at the end of fiscal  after giving effect to its recent mergers 
gross profit  defined as net sales less cost of sales  including distribution costs and store occupancy costs  increased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in margin was principally due to a change in sales mix in retail stores  improved margins in catalog operations  and the continued maturation of the company s store base 
store operating expenses  which includes payroll and benefits  advertising and other store level expenses  were of net sales for fiscal versus for fiscal store preopening expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the average preopening expenses for the north american petsmart format superstores opened in fiscal increased to  from  for the petsmart format superstores opened during fiscal the increase in preopening expenses on a per unit basis reflected the additional training and store setup costs incurred with the company s initial entry into canada which occurred in fourth quarter fiscal  as well as the company s five  square foot stores which opened in southern california 
general and administrative expenses were of net sales for fiscal versus for fiscal  due primarily to the elimination of the duplicate overhead costs related to the petstuff and pet food giant acquisitions 
merger and business integration charges of million related to the state line tack and pet city acquisitions were recorded in fiscal this charge included legal  investment banking  and accounting fees million  costs associated with reformatting  refixturing and remerchandising the acquired pet city superstores to the format consistent with that of a petsmart format superstore million  a provision for the closure of redundant and inadequate facilities million and other costs of consolidation million 
the company is also estimating that approximately million of similar business integration costs  primarily store conversion costs  associated with the pet city merger will be recognized as nonrecurring charges when incurred during the first half of fiscal also during fiscal  the company recorded merger and business integration charges of million to reflect additional lease termination costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with the settlement of lease obligations for the former petstuff stores closed by the company immediately following the merger with petstuff  along with seven lease commitments for future petstuff locations that were either duplicate or inadequate facilities and  therefore  never opened 
the company generated operating income of million for fiscal compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal however  excluding the merger and business integration charges recorded in both fiscal and fiscal  operating income increased million to million from million for fiscal excluding the merger and related non recurring charge  operating income as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal interest income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal principally due to the decrease in average cash balances in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal principally due to higher average borrowings outstanding during the period 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to a benefit of million for fiscal the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal  excluding the effect of permanent differences within the merger and business integration charges recorded in fiscal and fiscal and the effects of net operating loss carryforwards recognized in both years 
this increase was primarily due to an increased federal rate due to the absence of targeted job tax credits  lower tax advantaged investments  and a higher effective state income tax rate 
as a result of the foregoing  the company reported net income of million or per share for fiscal compared to a net loss  before accretion of the pet food giant and state line tack preferred stock  of million or per share for fiscal excluding the merger and business integration charges and the related tax benefits and recognition of net operating loss carryforwards recorded in both years  net income for fiscal  on a comparable basis  increased million to million or per share from million or per share for fiscal the company s north american operations  excluding merger and business integration charges and their related income tax effects  reported net income of per share for fiscal as compared to net income of per share for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to approximately billion for the fiscal from approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  fiscal 
comparable store sales for the north american stores  excluding the petstuff and pet food giant stores which were closed for retrofitting during the year  increased for fiscal  as compared to an increase of  excluding the petstuff and pet food giant stores  for fiscal due to the increasing maturity of its superstore base  as well as the opening of additional superstores in existing markets  the company anticipates that its rate of comparable store sales growth may be lower in future periods than previously reported 
comparable store sales for the united kingdom stores increased for fiscal during fiscal  the company opened new north american superstores and closed superstores  including four relocated stores  redundant and non performing petstuff superstores and one redundant pet food giant store  and opened eight superstores in the united kingdom during the year 
net sales from the north american superstores opened in fiscal contributed million or of the total increase in net sales 
of the remainder of the total net sales increase  million or was contributed by superstores opened in fiscal the company had superstores in operation at the end of fiscal compared to superstores open at the end of fiscal  after giving effect to its recent mergers 
gross profit  defined as net sales less cost of sales  including distribution costs and store occupancy costs  decreased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in margin was principally the result of higher occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  in the petstuff and pet food giant superstores during the year 
store operating expenses  which include payroll and benefits  advertising and other store level expenses  were of net sales for fiscal versus for fiscal this decrease as a percentage of net sales was due to improved payroll expense management and reduced advertising expenditures  primarily as the result of changing the petsmart superstores media mix from direct mail to newspaper inserts and improved advertising leverage as the result of the addition of new superstores in existing markets 
store preopening expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal primarily due to fewer store openings in fiscal versus fiscal the average preopening expenses for the north american petsmart format superstores opened in fiscal decreased to  from  for the petsmart format superstores  petstuff format superstores  and four pet food giant superstores opened during fiscal this decrease was the result of management efforts to improve efficiency by shortening the time required to open new superstores  as well as the lower cost to open a petsmart format superstore compared to petstuff and pet food giant format superstores 
general and administrative expenses were of net sales for fiscal versus for fiscal this decrease is due primarily to the elimination of the duplicate overhead costs related to the weisheimer companies  inc d b a petzazz  petstuff and pet food giant acquisitions 
merger and business integration charges of million related to the petstuff  sporting dog  and pet food giant acquisitions were recorded in fiscal this charge included legal  investment banking  and accounting fees million  costs associated with reformatting  refixturing and remerchandising the acquired superstores to the format consistent with that of a petsmart format superstore million  a provision for the closure of redundant and inadequate facilities million and other costs of consolidation  including employee severance  relocation costs and early termination fees on a credit facility million 
as a result of the above merger and business integration charges  the company incurred an operating loss of million for fiscal compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal however  excluding the merger and business integration charges recorded in both fiscal and fiscal  operating income increased million to million from million for fiscal excluding the merger and related non recurring charge  operating income as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal interest income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal principally due to the decrease in average cash balances in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal principally due to higher average borrowings outstanding during the period 
income tax benefit of million was recorded for fiscal compared to income tax expense of million for fiscal the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal  excluding the effect of permanent differences within the merger and business integration charges recorded in fiscal and fiscal and the effects of net operating loss carryforwards recognized in both years 
this increase was primarily due to an increased federal rate due to the absence of targeted job tax credits  lower tax advantaged investments  and a higher effective state income tax rate 
as a result of the foregoing  the company reported a net loss  before accretion of the pet food giant and state line tack preferred stock  of million or per share for fiscal compared to a net loss  before accretion of the pet food giant and state line tack preferred stock  of million or per share for fiscal excluding the merger and business integration charges and the related tax benefits and recognition of net operating loss carryforwards recorded in both years  net income for fiscal  on a comparable basis and before the pet food giant and state line tack accretion  increased million to million or per share from million or per share in fiscal the company s north american operations  excluding merger and business integration charges and their related income tax effects  reported net income of per share for fiscal as compared to net income of per share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations and expansion program to date principally through the sale of equity securities  raising an aggregate of approximately million since the company s inception  as well as from cash flow from operations 
additional sources of financing include real and personal property leases  bank lines of credit and vendor terms on inventory purchases 
at february   total assets were million  of which million were current assets 
cash and cash equivalents were million 
the principal use of operating cash is the purchase of merchandise inventories 
this usage is reduced by vendor credit terms that allow the company to finance a portion of its inventory purchases 
since petsmart s sales are on a cash and carry basis  cash flow generated from operating superstores provides a source of liquidity to the company 
net cash used in operations was million for fiscal  compared to cash provided of million fiscal approximately million of the cash used in operations during fiscal related to the timing of inventory purchases and payments for inventory balances required for the stores opened in the same period 
merchandise accounts payable leveraging the percentage of merchandise inventory financed by vendor credit terms  eg accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory  decreased to at february   compared to at january  inventory balances were approximately million at february   and million at january  the million increase from january  reflected approximately million of inventory required for the to superstores to be opened in the first quarter  approximately million for pet city and catalog inventories  and approximately million of inventory necessary to stock the company s new phoenix  arizona distribution center which began operations in fiscal therefore  on a comparable basis  inventory increased approximately million  or  from january  and average inventory per open store was approximately  at february   as compared to approximately  at january  the company has used cash in investing activities since inception to purchase leaseholds  fixtures and equipment for new superstores and  to a lesser extent  to purchase equipment and computer software in support of its administrative functions 
the company has also used cash to purchase superstores for sale and leaseback 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal net cash flow from financing activities  primarily borrowings and repayments under the company s bank credit facility  was million for fiscal subsequent to year end  the company amended its revolving bank credit arrangement to provide for a million arrangement that expires april  borrowings under the credit facility are unsecured and bear interest  at petsmart s option  at either the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants relating to net worth  debt to equity ratios  capital expenditures and minimum fixed charge coverage 
the company met all existing covenants in its credit agreement for fiscal and anticipates meeting all requirements for fiscal at february   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
the company also has several lease arrangements with leasing companies that the company uses to finance certain store and warehouse fixtures and equipment  point of sale equipment and management information systems 
the company s primary long term capital requirement is for opening new superstores 
all of the company s superstores are leased facilities 
the company currently expects to open at least additional north american superstores in fiscal  in addition to at least stores in the united kingdom 
the company estimates that its net cash requirements to open each superstore  including store fixtures and equipment  leasehold improvements  preopening costs and inventory will range from  to  this amount will include from  to  for leasehold improvements  depending upon whether the superstore site is a build to suit or a rehabilitated unit 
based upon the company s current plan to open at least north american superstores during fiscal  between million and million will be needed to finance the company s new superstore openings in the fiscal  of which approximately million to million will be financed through equipment leases 
the company may also expend additional funds to take advantage of opportunities that arise from time to time for the acquisition of businesses or lease rights from tenants occupying retail space that is suitable for a petsmart superstore 
the company intends to reposition approximately of its smaller former petstuff and petzazz units to larger stores in the same geographical areas 
the company intends to reposition to stores in fiscal  to stores in fiscal  and to stores in fiscal the cost of relocating the units will be expensed as incurred  with no unusual one time write offs currently anticipated 
the united states federal minimum wage is scheduled for a mandatory increase during fiscal the company does not believe this legislation will have a material adverse effect on its store operating expenses or results of operations for the next twelve months 
the company does not intend to own the land and buildings for its superstores 
however  to the extent the company believes that it is advantageous to purchase land for new superstores and to construct new superstore buildings itself  it will use its existing financing sources or cash to finance construction and  after the superstores are open  complete sale leaseback transactions or attempt to secure other permanent financing 
the company s expansion and store openings are dependent on adequate sources of capital for store site acquisition  building construction  fixturing and inventory  the training and retention of skilled managers and personnel  and other factors  some of which may be beyond the company s control 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve its targets for opening new superstores 
to the extent the company is unable to obtain satisfactory financing for new store growth  the company s ability to open new superstores  and profitably operate its current superstores  will be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to finance its operations without additional financing or other arrangements  or that such financing will be available to the company at an acceptable cost 
the company believes that its current cash balances  together with funds available from bank facilities  equipment lease arrangements and from operations will be adequate to meet its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  numerous factors  such as future acquisition opportunities or a change in expansion plans  may cause the company to change its current plans and seek additional funds 
the company is continually evaluating financing possibilities  and it may seek to raise additional funds through a debt or equity financing if it believes it would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders to do so 
the company has historically had higher short term cash requirements during periods of high store opening activity and during the holiday inventory build up in its third fiscal quarter 
although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe inflation is likely to have a material adverse effect on its net sales or results of operations
