item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company presently operates a one segment manufacturing business 
it principally manufactures power supplies and components for military and industrial use 
sales volume is primarily dependent on product mix in any given fiscal period 
this mix is in turn subject to the dictates of customer needs and delivery requirements 
these factors principally account for any variation in sales and operating income from year to year 
sales for fiscal years ended june    and were   and  respectively 
this decrease in sales resulted primarily from the consolidation and relocation of the facilities and personnel of one of the company s major customers 
this consolidation has caused delays in both ongoing and newly proposed programs 
the corresponding cost of sales during these fiscal years were   and  respectively 
although sales in decreased by approximately over the previous year  the gross profit percentage increased 
many of the contracts shipped in the fiscal year called for a somewhat higher gross profit margin than those shipped in the prior year 
as a result  cost of sales for the current period dropped to compared to the reflected last year 
this factor was the primary reason for the increase in net profits  although there was a decrease in sales 
a pretax write off of  relating to inventory was taken in the fourth quarter 
this write off caused the net loss per share during the current fourth quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately for the fiscal year 
this is primarily due to the transfer of a high level employee from a manufacturing position to an administrative position  in addition to an increase in legal expenses through the company s efforts to obtain patents on a number of its products 
earnings before income taxes increased in to  from  in net earnings per share increased to 
from 
the company s inventories have decreased from  to  as noted above  this decrease resulted primarily from the reduction of the company s backlog 
the change in the ratio of work in process to costs relating to contracts in process is primarily attributable to the allocation of approximately  to a project for one customer in contemplation of the execution of a contract 
the execution of a firm contract with this customer would bring the ratio to its fiscal year level 
negotiations with the customer are in progress  however  there is no guarantee that the contract will be signed 
business outlook customer order patterns are inherently difficult to predict 
as previously disclosed  one of the company s major customers has announced the consolidation and relocation of several of its facilities and various personnel 
the transition stage of this consolidation has caused delays in both ongoing and newly proposed programs 
at the present time  the company does not know what effect  this will have on the receipt of currently pending new business from this customer 
the company is hopeful that any further delays will be minimal 
the company believes that in the long term it will continue to obtain contracts consistent with its past experience as a result of the company s projected customer base 
the company currently has outstanding quotations well in excess of  for both repeat and new programs  in addition to increase option clauses in various existing contracts 
whether these quotations and options will result in firm contracts will depend on the outcome of the consolidation mentioned above and certain competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that the company will acquire contracts consistent with past experience since such a forward looking statement is subject to future events and market conditions which may affect the number of firm contracts acquired 
as was the case in fiscal  the company has been accepting orders with reduced profit margins because of the increasingly competitive nature of the marketplace 
the company is making efforts to resolve this situation by expanding its efforts to develop technologies and products of a more proprietary nature for sale in the commercial and military marketplace 
the company s efforts and investment in the advancement and refinement of both military and industrial technologies has resulted in the company receiving notices of allowability for the following three patents i dental implant for promoting bone growth  ii quiet transformer for naval application  and iii dual dipole antenna for military communications applications 
current demographics indicate a need for the products for which the company has received patents  particularly in the military marketplace  as well as a worldwide need for the company s long range radar transmitters and components for high power ac locomotives 
the management currently anticipates that the course of action the company has taken will enhance the company s revenues and profitability in future periods based on these indicated needs 
liquidity and capital expenditures the company s working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business  and during the past three fiscal years  the company  when possible  has funded all of its operations  including financing activities  with cash flows resulting from operating activities 
the company did not borrow any funds during the last three fiscal years and does not currently anticipate that it will borrow any funds during fiscal year the company s working capital for fiscal years ended june    and was   and  respectively 
the principal reason for the decrease in working capital between and was the repurchase by the company of its common stock during in the total amount of  on march   the company purchased a combined total of  shares of common stock from the entwistle company and global securities at a total cost of  in addition  the company purchased  shares of common stock from the company s esop during for a total purchase price of  under existing authorizations  as of august   funds in the amount of  were available for the continuing repurchase of the company s shares of common stock 
in the statement of cash flows  the increasein net cash provided by operating activities between fiscal years and was due primarily to a decrease in material purchases in keeping with the reduction in the company s current backlog 
the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities between fiscal years and was a result of the decrease in the investment base for the purchase of the company s common stock as set forth in paragraph above 
the company s combined investment in both short term investments and marketable investment securities was i  as of june   ii  as of june   iii  as of june   iv  as of june   and v  as of june  the short term investments consisted of certificates of deposit and united states treasury bills 
during fiscal years through  interest rates on short term investments ranged from to 
this factor accounts  along with the changes in the overall balances of short term investments and marketable investment securities  for the fluctuation of interest income during much of the five year period 
interest income was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal interest income in fiscal and  however  was affected by the decrease in the company s investment base arising from the capital expenditures of  in and purchase of the company s common stock in the amount of  during fiscal as set forth above 
a majority of the company s investment base is represented by certificates of deposit  united states government treasury securities and a money market account 
consequently  the company does not feel that there is any significant risk associated with its investment policy 
management feels that the company s reserve for bad debts of  is adequate  since given the customers with whom the company deals  particularly the united states government and its agencies  the amount of bad debts over the years has been minimal 
the company does not currently offer  nor does management currently contemplate offering in the future  any post retirement or employment benefits 
consequently  no accruals or liabilities have been provided for in the financial statements 
during fiscal year  the company expended approximately  for plant improvements and new equipment 
the company plans to expend approximately  for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal management presently anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations

the adoption of this accounting standard had no effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
other matters an employee retirement plan and trust esop was established for the eligible non union employees of the company and was effective as of july  the esop used the proceeds of a loan from the company to purchase  shares of the company s common stock for approximately million  and the company contributed approximately  to the esop  which was used by the esop to purchase an additional  shares of the company s common stock 
each year the company makes contributions to the esop which are used to make loan interest and principal payments 
with each loan and interest payment  a portion of the common stock will be allocated to participating employees 
as of june   there were  shares allocated to participants 
dividends attributable to allocated shares were likewise allocated to the participants accounts  whereas the dividends on unallocated shares were used as part of the loan repayment  thus reducing the company s required contribution 
the loan from the company to the esop is repayable in annual installments of  including interest through june  interest is payable at a rate of per annum
