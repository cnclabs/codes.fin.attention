item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition impact of acquisitions the company was formed in july to acquire a hospital contract management business 
during fiscal  the company acquired five hospitals and affiliated health care entities 
the company also sold a minority interest in an acute care hospital in papillon  nebraska and agreed to sell its remaining interest in fiscal during fiscal  the company acquired two hospitals and affiliated health care entities and sold one hospital and a minority interest in another hospital 
during fiscal  the company acquired three hospitals and affiliated health care entities 
because of the financial impact of the company s recent acquisitions and divestitures  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between the company s financial statements for the fiscal years presented 
in addition  due to the current number of owned hospitals  each additional hospital acquisition can significantly affect the overall operating margin of the company 
during a one to three year transition period after the acquisition of a hospital  the company has typically taken a number of steps to lower operating costs 
the impact of such actions can be partially offset by cost increases to expand the hospital s services  strengthen its medical staff and improve its market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins may not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of an acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
as the company makes additional hospital acquisitions  the company expects that this effect will be mitigated by the expanded financial base of existing hospitals

general the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs accounted for approximately   and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are prospective  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
the payment rate increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
both federal and state legislators are continuing to scrutinize the health care industry for the purpose of reducing health care costs 
while the company is unable to predict what  if any  future health reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  the company expects continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental health care programs 
under the balanced budget act of the act  there will be no increases in the rates paid to acute care hospitals for inpatient care through september  payments for medicare outpatient services provided at acute care hospitals and home health services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain limits 
the act requires that the payment for those services be converted to a prospective payment system  which will be phased in over time 
further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit health care spending could have a material adverse impact upon the health care industry and the company 
the act also contains various provisions that create new opportunities for the company 
certain of those provisions  such as those allowing for creation of provider service organizations  allow providers such as the company to contract directly with the federal government for the provision of medical care to medicare beneficiaries on a fully capitated basis 
under capitation  the company receives a certain amount from the federal government for each medicare beneficiary enrolled in its plans and assumes the risks and rewards of meeting the health care needs of those enrolled in its plans 
the company may purchase insurance to cover all or a portion of the cost of meeting the health care needs of those covered 
the company cannot predict at this time what the ultimate effect of these opportunities will be 
in addition  states  insurance companies and employers are actively negotiating amounts paid to hospitals  which are typically lower than their standard rates 
the trend toward managed care  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care  may adversely affect hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
the company s acute care hospitals  like most acute care hospitals in the united states  have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the company expects increased competition and admission constraints to continue in the future 
the ability to successfully respond to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental health care programs  will play a significant role in determining hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
the company expects the industry trend from inpatient to outpatient services to continue due to the increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
outpatient revenue of the company s owned hospitals for the years ended june   and  was approximately  and of gross patient service revenue  respectively 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected in a positive manner over time by the company s ability to acquire acute care hospitals at acceptable prices 
while the company believes that trends in the health care industry described above may create possible future acquisition opportunities  it can give no assurances that it can continue to purchase acute care hospitals 
the company s owned hospitals accounted for of the company s net operating revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal carolinas hospital system  desert springs hospital  flowers hospital  gadsden regional medical center and lutheran hospital of indiana accounted for approximately of the company s net operating revenue in fiscal inflation the health care industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in marketplaces occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to the company in the form of higher prices 
the company has generally been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges  expanding services and implementing cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
the company cannot predict its ability to offset or control future cost increases
