item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies have a material effect on the insurance brokerage industry 
commission revenues are based on a percentage of the premiums paid by the insured and generally follow premium levels 
lower premium rates and excess capacity prevail among property and casualty insurance carriers resulting in heavy competition for market share 
this soft market ie  lower premium rates has generally resulted in flat or reduced renewal commissions during the period 
during the past three years  several catastrophes have caused billions of dollars of insured losses domestically and abroad 
according to some estimates  will rank as the fifth most expensive year on record with over billion in insured property losses

a recent report claims the property casualty insurance industry began to materially weaken its core loss reserves in which reverses several years of favorable reserving trends 
in spite of forces which would reduce competition and weaken profits  there is still little change in property casualty rates 
sufficient capacity remains and the sharply competitive environment continues

the company anticipates new sales in the risk management  benefits and self insurance services areas will again be a major factor in fee revenue growth in historically  inflation has contributed to increased property replacement costs and higher litigation awards causing some clients to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
these factors have the effect of generating higher premiums to customers and higher commissions to the company 
more recently  the united states and other parts of the world have experienced low rates of inflation along with business downsizing  reduced sales and lower payrolls 
these events have resulted in lower levels of exposures to insure 
in general  premium rates have had a greater effect on the company s revenues than inflation 
although the company reported record net earnings in  it is looking to the future and exploring not only the core businesses of brokering insurance and risk management services  but also expanding within the fields of insurance captives and financial and related investment services 
these are areas which may hold opportunities for future profit growth
