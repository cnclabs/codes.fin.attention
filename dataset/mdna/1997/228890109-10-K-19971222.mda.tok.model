the company distills citrus brandy  citrus and cane spirits and rum  produces fortified citrus wine  and sells these products to over producers of beverage alcohol in the united states and other foreign countries

the company s citrus brandy is used primarily as an ingredient in flavored brandies 
citrus spirits are used primarily as a fortifying ingredient to increase the alcohol content of the company s citrus wine and the wine of other manufacturers 
the company s citrus wine is fermented from citrus juice and fortified to increase its alcohol content to approximately by volume 
known as fortified citrus wine  this product is used primarily as an ingredient in cordials  whiskies and other beverage alcohol 
rum and cane spirits are distilled from sugar cane molasses and are sold to other bottlers of rum  producers of beverage alcohol  food companies and flavor manufacturers 
rum is also used in the company s spirits line 
case goods spirits 
the company produces  bottles and sells a complete line of spirits under its own proprietary labels and under the private labels of major retailers of liquor located in the southeast 
these products currently include rum  gin  vodka  tequila  cordials and various whiskies  and the company continues to add additional products to this line 
since the acquisition of the virgin islands operations in  the company also produces and sells case goods spirits in the us virgin islands under the cruzan rum label 
the company s proprietary labels include cruzan estate rums  cruzan rums  ron carlos rums  conch republic rums and james s harbor gin  rum and vodka 
the company distills its own rum  but generally produces its other spirits from grain alcohol purchased from third parties 
depending on the particular formula for a product  the company adds flavoring and or sugar  reduces the product s proof and then filters and bottles the finished product 
also  the company began in to import and market cruzan rum  porfidio tequila and several brands from the former blair product line which was discontinued in management s strategy has been to focus on marketing and building premium brands in its case goods spirits business with an initial emphasis on the rum and tequila categories 
contract bottling 
the company bottles coolers  prepared cocktails and other beverage alcohol on a contract basis for other producers 
the company also bottles non alcohol beverage on a contract basis including fruit juices  carbonated and non carbonated fruit flavored beverages  flavored sparkling water and ready to drink brewed iced teas 
vinegar and cooking wine 
to complement its distilling  winery and bottling operations  the company produces vinegar and cooking wine for sale to condiment manufacturers  food service distributors and major retailers 
the company s sales to retailers are sold under its own proprietary labels and under the private labels of major retailers in the southeast 
during the quarter ended september   the company discontinued the operations of blair  sold substantially all of its assets  terminated its employees  closed its facilities and began liquidating its remaining assets 
the company acquired blair in august at that time management believed that blair would enhance the company s national sales capabilities and provide an entry to the imported wine and spirits segment of the beverage alcohol market 
however  beginning in january  blair incurred substantial operating losses 
in  the losses from blair amounted to  net of tax benefit of  including operating losses during the phase out period of  these losses resulted from  among other things  the failure to meet exaggerated sales and gross profit projections furnished to the company  unrecorded liabilities  surplus inventories  and inadequate reserves for uncollectible receivables  all of which were uncovered subsequent to the acquisition 
the company is reserving all rights that it has to indemnification from the selling shareholders of blair under the merger agreement relating to the acquisition 
see item legal proceedings and note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information on the discontinued operations 
the company s net sales and gross margins gross profit as a percentage of net sales vary depending on the mix of business among the company s products 
historically  gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products and lower in case goods spirits  contract bottling  vinegar and cooking wine operations 
within its contract bottling operations  sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the company s type a and type b bottling customers 
type a bottling customers pay the company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to the customer 
type b bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges 
although gross profit per case for the company s type a and type b bottling customers is approximately equal  given the same case volume  net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for type a bottling customers are higher  and gross margins are lower  than for type b bottling customers 
as a result  significant fluctuations in volume of type a bottling customers can distort the company s gross margin 
the company has a limited number of customers  and these customers often purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services 
accordingly  the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
additionally  some company products generate higher profit margins than others  and changes in the company s product mix will cause gross margins to fluctuate 
certain aspects of the company s business are also seasonal  with increased demand for the company s contract bottling services from april to october and increased production of the company s bulk alcohol products during the months from october to june  corresponding to the florida citrus growing season 
as a result of these factors  the company s operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
net sales represent the company s gross sales less excise taxes 
excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the company 
in addition  excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers 
accordingly  excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the company s product and customer mix
