ethyol sales to the wholesale trade amounted to million as reported by alza from the date of launch to december  sales of the company s other two products  hexalen and neutrexin declined in due  in part  to the promotional emphasis placed on the launch of ethyol 
in addition  the company believes that during  the launch of competitive new products had a negative impact on sales of hexalen 
the company further believes that sales of neutrexin have been adversely affected by a decline in the incidence and severity of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pcp due to improvements in the treatment for human immunodeficiency virus hiv and prophylactic treatment for patients at risk for pcp 
net investment income increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the same period of the million increase is attributable to the increased portfolio balance resulting from the company s december private placement and the initial distribution fee received from alza as part of the us distribution and co promotion agreement for ethyol consummated in late licensing  royalty and other income decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is principally due to the million recognized in for us marketing and distribution rights for ethyol from alza

during  net cash used in operations amounted to  principally reflecting the net effect of the factors discussed above under results of operations and offsetting decreases in current assets and liabilities 
in current assets  the decrease reflects the receipt in january of a portion of the distribution fee paid by alza as part of the us ethyol distribution agreement 
the decrease in current liabilities is due to the payment to scherico  in april  of the company s share of operating losses related to the original ethyol european distribution agreement 
until such time as the company receives significantly increased revenues  the company s cash position will continue to be reduced due principally to expenditures in research  clinical development  product development  marketing  and selling and administrative activities 
failure to achieve significant sales from the company s currently approved products and to obtain additional regulatory approvals on products currently in development will have a material adverse effect on the company 
the level of future product sales will depend on several factors  including product acceptance  market penetration  competitive products  the incidence and severity of diseases and side effects for which the company s products are indicated  the performance of the company s licensees and distributors  and the healthcare and reimbursement system existing in each market where the company s products are or may become commercially available 
in february  the company entered into a stock purchase agreement with alza pursuant to which the company agreed to sell to alza  subject to certain closing conditions  including  inter alia  hart scott rodino clearance   shares of the company s common stock for gross consideration of  the company believes its current cash and investments coupled with the funds to be received under the stock purchase agreement with alza and anticipated revenues generated from product sales and other sources  will be sufficient to cover the company s anticipated level of cash requirements for a period in excess of three years 
however  the company s funding requirements may change due to numerous factors  including but not limited to  sales of the company s products  manufacturing costs  reimbursement policies  regulatory and intellectual property requirements  capital expenditure and other factors as discussed herein 
the company is hopeful that its products will  in the near future  generate sufficient sales to provide meaningful cash resources  although no assurance can be given that they will do so 
the company is also hopeful that it will in the future receive further regulatory approvals and that such approvals will increase sales 
however  no assurance can be given that further regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if ever  or that the return on product sales will be sufficient to cover operating expenses or that the company will have adequate financial resources to commercialize its products 
to meet its capital requirements  the company may from time to time seek to access public or private financing markets by issuing debt  common or preferred stock  warrants or other securities  either separately or in combination 
the company may also seek additional funding through corporate collaborations or other financing vehicles  potentially including off balance sheet financing through partnerships or corporations 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available at all or on terms acceptable to the company 
in addition  market reaction to any such financings may adversely affect the price of the company s outstanding securities or debt 
the company s net capital expenditures were  for the year ended december  and total  since inception 
in april  the company purchased a sterile products production facility in the netherlands 
validation work and pilot production on this new facility were completed in the facility received regulatory approval for product manufacture and distribution from the dutch regulatory authority in june to manufacture the company s products for distribution in the european community  and the facility was approved by the fda to manufacture neutrexin for the us market in may and to manufacture ethyol for the us market in december the manufacturing facilities of the company and its third party suppliers used to produce its products are required to continually comply with all applicable fda requirements and those of regulatory authorities in other countries including good manufacturing practices  and are subject to inspection by governmental agencies to determine compliance with those requirements 
there can be no assurance that the manufacturing facilities for the company s products will comply with applicable requirements 
a mortgage loan of approximately  relating to the company s facility in the netherlands was obtained in may the purchase price for this facility was  and  in capital improvements have been made since its purchase to make the facility operational and expand its production capacity 
further capital expenditures  estimated at  are planned during the company s future liquidity and capital requirements are dependent upon several factors  including  but not limited to  its success in generating significant revenues from sales  the performance of its sublicensees and distributors under sublicense and distribution arrangements for sales of its products  the time and cost required to manufacture and market its products  the time and cost required for clinical development of products to obtain regulatory approvals  including expanded labeling for its products which are already commercially available  obtaining the rights to additional commercially viable compounds  competitive technological developments  additional government imposed regulation and control  and changes in healthcare systems which affect reimbursement  pricing or availability of drugs and market acceptance of drugs 
the above factors may also affect realization of certain assets currently held by the company  principally investments in plant  equipment and inventory 
in  scherico  the company s european distributor for ethyol  launched ethyol in several european markets where regulatory approvals had been received 
under the terms of its original agreement with scherico  the company was to share in operating profits losses generated from marketing and sales of ethyol in germany  the united kingdom  spain  italy and france for a period of up to two years from november  the company paid its share of the operating losses million in april and had accrued  during the first six months of for its estimated share of operating losses through the period 
in september  the scherico amendment was executed pursuant to which  retroactive to january   scherico began to purchase ethyol from the company at a price based on a percentage of in market net sales and the company no longer participates in operating profits losses previously shared by the parties 
in addition  as noted above  scherico paid the company a total of million under the scherico amendment in the fourth quarter of in april of  alza and the company launched ethyol in the united states 
alza has exclusive rights to market the product in the united states for five years and will be responsible for sales and marketing 
the company s us sales force will co promote the product with alza during this period 
after the initial five year period  alza has an option to extend its exclusive rights for one year 
at the end of alza s exclusive period  all us marketing rights to ethyol will revert to the company  and alza will receive payments from the company for ten years based on in market net sales of the product 
alza paid the company an up front payment and initial distribution fee totaling million and the agreement provides for million in additional distribution fees to be paid to the company during the next few years based on the achievement of certain milestones related to the company s clinical development of ethyol 
as the company sells ethyol to its partners  scherico and alza  in quantities  which may or may not correspond to the product s resale to the pharmaceutical trade  the company s sales may fluctuate from period to period dependent upon the timing of its partners delivery requirements and sales to the pharmaceutical trade as well as the levels of inventory they stock and maintain 
sales of ethyol are also affected by the same factors noted elsewhere in this section on liquidity and capital resources 
the company is hopeful that the commercialization of ethyol in the united states and europe will be successful 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will achieve meaningful revenues under its agreements with alza and scherico or its other distribution arrangements 
the company has been unprofitable since its inception and expects to incur additional operating losses until such time as substantial sales are realized and further regulatory approvals are obtained  although the distribution fees from alza corporation did bring the company close to a break even position for calendar and the company reported net earnings in the third quarter of as a result of non recurring items relating to the scherico amendment noted herein 
as the company continues its commercialization  research and development activities  losses are expected to continue and may fluctuate from period to period 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
for the period from may  inception through december   the company had an accumulated deficit of
