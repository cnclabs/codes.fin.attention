item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed below are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties set forth below in this section under the sub heading factors affecting future results 
results of operations revenues in fiscal declined to million  from million in fiscal revenues in fiscal increased over the million of fiscal the decline in revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower than expected orders from one customer after the company had structured its business to concentrate on this customer and a general decline in foundry business due to excess supply relative to demand experienced by several customers 
the fiscal to fiscal growth was driven mainly by increased demand for standard products for secondary storage applications and higher average selling prices for foundry products 
foundry product sales accounted for of sales in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal  reflecting a continued shift from foundry product sales to sales of the company s standard products 
the company anticipates that revenues for fiscal will be lower than in fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to less than optimum utilization of the company s wafer manufacturing capacity  due to the adverse business environment discussed earlier and the company s exit from the gate array business 
specifically included in cost of revenues for fiscal are provisions of million for gate array inventories related to the company s decision to discontinue the gate array product line see note of notes to financial statements and million for specific inventories associated with customer order cancellations and an overall decline in customer demand 
the improvement from fiscal to fiscal was due to a higher level of factory utilization and an increased mix of standard products  with a higher average selling price than foundry products 
research and development expense in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher product development efforts on new standard products 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher product development spending for secondary storage and epac tm products 
due to the downturn in the company s business  the company is currently evaluating its planned expense level for research and development 
the company believes that research and development expense will remain at or below the fiscal level during fiscal  but it could fluctuate as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to accounts receivable provisions of approximately million due to the company s exit from the gate array business see note of notes to financial statements and additional reserves taken for potential bad debts  partially offset by lower sales commissions 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to higher sales commissions 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company s operating results were affected by a decline in product demand and a downturn in the market 
in response to the downturn  the company made the decision to implement a restructuring plan which involved discontinuing the gate array product line  downsizing the workforce and closing a recently acquired new product design center 
the company incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million during the second quarter of fiscal the charge comprises employee termination costs of  associated with reductions in the workforce  a design center equipment write off of  due to management s decision to close one of the company s design center facilities  and  associated with wafer cancellation costs and the write off of gate array capital equipment no longer usable 
net interest expense in fiscal was approximately million compared to  in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to costs associated with increases in leased equipment  while the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower interest rates on capitalized leases 
the company had a net loss of million in fiscal  or 
per share  compared to a profit of million in fiscal or 
per share  and  in fiscal  or 
per share 
the fiscal net loss was primarily attributable to low factory utilization  costs associated with exiting the gate array business  and the closing of a new product design center 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalent increased to million at march  from million at march   and million at march  the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to financing of equipment used in production and management s continuous efforts to reduce costs to be more in line with current sales levels 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to increased cash flows from operations offset by the purchase of capital equipment and payments on existing lines of credit and capital lease obligations 
cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal to fiscal decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was due primarily to the net loss of million and a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of million 
partially offsetting these factors was a decrease of million in accounts receivable due to a decrease in sales  a decrease of million in inventories due to management efforts to reduce inventory to be more in line with current sales levels and an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense 
the fiscal to fiscal increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was due primarily to the fiscal net profit of approximately million and increases in accrued payroll  related expenses and current liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash used for investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal  reflecting cash invested in property and equipment acquisitions 
management expects capital additions for fiscal to remain flat or below fiscal capital additions 
cash flows provided for financing activities in fiscal were  as compared to million used for such activities in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  the company made payments on capital lease obligations and notes payable of million and million  respectively 
this was offset by proceeds from notes payable of million and proceeds of million related to stock option exercises 
cash flows used for financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of payments on capital lease obligations of million and payments on the company s line of credit of million  offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
cash flows used for financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of payments on capital lease obligations of million offset by proceeds of long term financing of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of  the company s recent operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash 
the company believes that its existing cash balances  expected cash flows from operations  equipment lease financing and its available line of credit will be sufficient to meet its projected working capital and other cash requirements throughout fiscal although the company has taken measures to conserve cash  there can be no assurance as to when it will return to profitability or that such additional financing  if required  can be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
at march   the company had a line of credit agreement with a bank which provides through october   for borrowings up to the lesser of  or up to of eligible accounts receivable 
at march   no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit 
borrowings under this line of credit accrue interest at the bank s reference rate plus 
resulting in an interest rate of at march  and are collateralized by all of the assets of the company 
under the agreement  the company is restricted from paying dividends and is required to maintain certain financial ratios among other restrictive covenants 
at march   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under this financing agreement due to the decline in the company s operating results  for which it expects to obtain a waiver from the bank 
the company intends to renew this line of credit under a new agreement in october but there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so upon acceptable terms 
factors affecting future results the company s business  financial condition and results of operations have been  and may in the future  be affected by a variety of factors  including markets for its products and those of its customers  foundry utilization  concentration of customers  its ability to retain trained design and process engineers  the development and introduction of new technology and products and the availability of raw materials 
the fulfillment arrangements for standard analog products generally provide that orders may be terminated at will by either party and the customer is not required to commit to purchase a specific number of products  although cancellation or rescheduling charges may be imposed in certain circumstances 
the unanticipated loss of any of its major customers or the unanticipated cancellation or rescheduling of orders by any of them could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  particularly if the company s efforts with other customers do not result in the volume of manufacturing orders anticipated by the company 
iomega  which accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal  has advised the company that the company s products will not be a part of iomega s long term product strategy and sales to iomega are projected to be lower in the foreseeable future than they were during fiscal orders from the company s largest foundry customer  ir  declined significantly during the year and sales in the foreseeable future are projected to be significantly less than they were during fiscal orders for rockwell were completed during the fiscal year and the company does not anticipate continued sales to rockwell in fiscal the above described actions by such major customers  along with other cancellations and delays by the company s customers will adversely affect the company s business and results of operations through fiscal and for the foreseeable future 
any further decline in demand for the company s products  or any other decline in the demand by end users of the products produced by the company s customers could lead to a further decline in  or cancellation of  orders for the company s products by its customers  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the current business climate has and will continue to result in less than optimum utilization of the company s foundry  which will adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company made two significant reductions in workforce during fiscal that primarily affected manufacturing employees 
the ability of the company to transition from the fabrication of lower margin products to higher margin products  including both those developed by the company and those for which it serves as a third party foundry  is very important for the company s future results of operations 
rapidly changing customer demands may result in the obsolescence of existing company inventories 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts to keep pace with changing customer demands 
in this regard  the ability of the company to develop higher margin products will be materially and adversely affected if it is unable to retain its engineering personnel due to the company s current business climate 
although the company believes it currently has adequate access to necessary raw materials  it does not have any long term commitments for the supply of raw wafers and polysubstrates

march  these lawsuits  all of which include similar factual allegations  allege that the company and certain of its present and former officers and directors issued false or misleading statements regarding the company s business  resulting in inflation of the company s stock price  and that certain of the defendants traded stock while in possession of material adverse information 
these lawsuits assert claims under the federal securities laws  california securities laws  and california common law 
the plaintiffs in all actions seek damages in an unspecified amount 
these cases are presently in the early stages  and no trial dates have been established 
the company believes it has valid defenses to these claims  and intends to defend them vigorously 
there is no assurance  however  that the lawsuits will be resolved in a timely or satisfactory manner or that the lawsuits will be resolved without additional significant costs to the company 
the company has incurred significant costs to date in its defense and even if the lawsuits are resolved in a timely or satisfactory manner  these lawsuits have in the past and in the future will cause management distraction from the operations of the company 
therefore  irrespective of the outcome of the litigation  there could be a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation  management is not able to reasonably estimate losses that may be incurred in relation to this litigation 
however  based on the facts presently known  management believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
