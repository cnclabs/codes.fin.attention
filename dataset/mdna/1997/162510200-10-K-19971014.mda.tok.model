future financing requirements at june   the company had a working capital deficiency of million 
the company requires the availability of sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity to finance its existing product lines and to develop and market its licensed nautica product lines 
the company expects to satisfy such requirements through cash flow from operations  borrowings under the new financing agreement and proceeds from the rights offering 
although there can be no assurance  the company believes that if the restructuring is consummated  the company will have sufficient cash flow and credit availability to meet its needs at least through the end of the fiscal the foregoing discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon current expectations and involve a number of uncertainties  including the company s ability to obtain additional financing  retail market conditions  consumer acceptance of the company s products  shareholder approval of certain matters related to the restructuring and consummation of the restructuring 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation which recently have been experienced in the united states  where it competes  have had a significant effect on its net sales or profitability 
seasonality historically  the company s sales and operating results fluctuate by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the company s first and third fiscal quarters 
it is in these quarters that the company s fall and spring product lines  which traditionally have had the highest volume of net sales  are shipped to customers  with revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
as a result  the company experiences significant variability in its quarterly results and working capital requirements 
moreover  delays in shipping can cause revenues to be recognized in a later quarter  resulting in further variability in such quarterly results
