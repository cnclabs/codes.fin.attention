fas requires  among other things  the recognition of deferred tax assets  including the future benefit associated with operating loss carryforwards  a periodic evaluation of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets are realizable and the establishment of a valuation allowance  in certain circumstances  to offset deferred tax assets to the extent realization is not considered more likely than not 
during fiscal  and  the company evaluated its deferred tax asset and reversed a portion of its valuation allowance  resulting in a recognized tax benefit of million  million and million  respectively 
among the factors considered in this year s recognition were 
a history of sustained profitability of the core mag businesses  even during the loss years which included operating losses from retail businesses subsequently sold or liquidated  
operating results improved compared to  but earnings have not yet recovered to either the level or to the historical amounts earned in the s 
aggregate pre tax earnings from continuing operations for the four years following the restructuring in were approximately million  
the company s income prospects in future years after consideration of the million available operating loss carryforwards  the substantial portion of which do not expire until the period 
utilization of the entire available tax loss carryforwards by would require annual taxable income to average approximately million 
as the company does expect to achieve positive earnings for both financial reporting and tax purposes in future years  it was concluded that the more likely than not criteria appropriately justified the recognition of a portion of the available tax benefits 
after giving effect to the benefit of future operating loss carryforwards and other timing differences recognized  the remaining valuation reserve at november  was million 
earnings and shareholders equity would be accordingly increased upon the determination that the realization of the remaining reserved tax asset is more likely than not 
also see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of deferred tax assets and remaining operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company replaced its million borrowing facility  originally due to mature on december   with million of public senior subordinated debentures  a million revolving credit facility with a nine member lending group credit facility and the private placement of million of industrial development bonds issued by development authorities in prior years and maturing in the refinancing accomplished several of the company s objectives  including extending maturities  reducing the level of borrowings subject to interest rate variability and establishing a separate working capital facility providing greater flexibility in addressing the company s seasonal borrowing requirements 
the credit facility is secured by inventories  accounts receivable and intangibles of the company and its subsidiaries 
facility amendments in july  november and january  among other things  resulted in a reduction in the fees  administrative charges and effective borrowing rates  adjustment of certain covenants and extension of the term from march to july the facility contains certain restrictions on the operation of the company s business  including covenants pertaining to capital expenditures  asset sales  operating leases  minimum net worth and incurrence of additional indebtedness  ratios relating to minimum accounts payable to inventory  maximum funded debt to ebitda and minimum fixed charge coverage  as well as other customary covenants  representations and warranties  and events of default 
the company was in compliance with the above noted covenants 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the improvement in compared to was attributable to both the higher earnings and working capital reductions during the year 
the decline in compared to was principally attributable to a smaller reduction in working capital than in and the lower earnings 
at november   net accounts receivable of million increased million from november  excluding the receivables acquired as a result of the plaid asset purchase  the increase was million or  principally reflecting the higher fourth quarter sales 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million compared to million last year  representing of gross receivables in each year 
inventories of million at november  increased million from november  excluding the amounts acquired as a result of the plaid asset purchase  inventories declined approximately million or  principally attributable to inventory reductions in the moderately priced businesses 
inventory turn  which improved in compared to  was at the level 
recoverable and deferred income taxes at november  aggregated million compared to million at november  the balance at november  reflected a valuation allowance of million million at november  principally related to tax assets associated with prior years operating losses 
as discussed previously under income taxes  the company has evaluated and will continue to evaluate the necessity for the valuation allowance taking into consideration such factors as earnings trends and prospects  anticipated reversal of temporary differences between financial and taxable income  the expiration or limitations of operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies including the ability to adopt the fifo inventory method for those inventories currently valued under the lifo valuation method 
approximately million of the total deferred income taxes has been classified as non current  principally associated with the benefit recognized attributable to expected utilization of future operating loss carryforwards 
at november   the company had approximately million of federal tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
at november   net properties were million compared to million at november  capital additions during were million compared to million in depreciation expense was million in and million in capital additions are expected to be principally funded from cash generated from operating activities

excluding this payment  november debt levels were favorable to last year by million 
the company s guarantee of a million industrial development bond assumed by kuppenheimer is included in long term debt as a result of kuppenheimer filing for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in august the million of notes payable classified as current at november  reflects the anticipated debt reduction during fiscal under the company s long term credit facility arrangements

dividends have not been paid since and no dividends are anticipated to be declared during fiscal the current credit facility restricts  but does not prohibit  the payment of dividends 
considering the impact of inflation  the current value of net assets would be higher than the company s million book value after reflecting the company s use of lifo inventory method and increases in the value of the properties since acquisition 
earnings would be lower than reported  assuming higher depreciation expense without a corresponding reduction in taxes 
outlook industry conditions stabilized in the second half of this followed the unfavorable industry environment prevailing in and through the first half of characterized by generally weak sales of apparel at retail  increasing retailer bankruptcies and wholesale pricing pressures most affecting the moderately priced tailored clothing products 
this more favorable condition contributed to the company s improved second half and full year operating results compared to and has continued into early as noted previously  the company purchased substantially all of the license rights  current assets  properties and operations of plaid at fiscal year end 
the owned and licensed men s tailored clothing brands acquired include the burberrys  evan picone  claiborne  palm beach and brannoch product lines 
it is anticipated that these product lines will generate aggregate sales in excess of million in fiscal after considering the incremental borrowing costs associated with financing the million paid for the plaid assets  it is expected that fiscal cash operating earnings attributable to the product lines acquired will approximate the borrowing costs 
in subsequent years  the impact is expected to be increasingly favorable  resulting from the consolidation of production facilities and reduced general and administrative expenses arising from the integration of certain functions with those of existing company operating units 
the company s preeminent position in tailored clothing has been enhanced by the brands acquired from plaid as noted above 
also  recent initiatives in the tommy hilfiger  perry ellis and daniel hechter brands are expected to contribute to enhanced revenues

in the women s apparel group  demand for the austin reed women s line of tailored coats  pants and dresses has been strong  augmented by the moderately priced hawksley and wight line first delivered in spring the current apparel environment has been  and continues to be highly competitive  characterized by stable or declining wholesale prices 
gross margin enhancement remains a high priority  and is being addressed through more effective material purchasing and utilization techniques  improved manufacturing methods in company operated production facilities and from a greater percentage of foreign sourcing 
selling  general and administrative expenses during were reduced both in absolute dollars and as percentage of revenues 
while preserving the autonomy of the various marketing companies  the ongoing programs to leverage resources in the accounting  credit and information systems areas continue  with the objective of further reducing the operating expense ratio to sales 
debt and related interest expense reduction continue as important elements to enhanced profitability 
excluding the million paid for the plaid acquisition at fiscal year end  total debt declined million compared to year end and interest expense decreased million from levels  principally from the working capital reductions and cash earnings 
interest savings of approximately 
million in resulted from million of public market purchases of the company s senior subordinated debentures utilizing credit facility availability  approximately million of additional debenture repurchases are permitted under the company s credit facility 
the recent stabilization in industry conditions  the anticipated revenue growth from acquisitions and product line extensions  and continuing emphasis on cost control and debt reduction covering all aspects of operations are expected to collectively contribute to an improved earnings performance in
