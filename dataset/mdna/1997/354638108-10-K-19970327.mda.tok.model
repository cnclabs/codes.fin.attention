the company holds a interest in fsrt  and it is the sole general partner of the partnership 
the company also arranged for a million line of credit in december  which was unused at year end  but which is expected to provide capital for future acquisitions and for other liquidity needs

property operating expenses  which generally include maintenance and repairs  property taxes  utilities  and on site administrative expense  declined slightly compared to due to non recurring expenses recorded in related to discontinuing operations of a self service car wash at the mira loma center 
excluding those expenses  operating expenses increased approximately compared to in  minor increases in several expense categories were offset by a decline in electricity expense caused by milder summertime temperatures in southern california 
the acquisition of the lam research buildings did not cause property operating expenses to increase in since the tenant pays the expenses directly 
related party expense increased  or in reflecting an increase in advisory fees of  and an increase in property management fees of  which were partially offset by a decline of  in reimbursements to the advisor for accounting and data processing costs 
the increase in advisory fees was caused by the acquisition of the lam research buildings  and the adoption of the company s advisory agreement by the two reits that merged with the company in may prior to the merger  the reits operated under advisory agreements containing different methods of compensation to the advisor 
general and administrative expense increased approximately  in primarily due to legal and consulting fees related to locating potential property acquisitions  expenses of transferring ownership of the data general building to fsrt  and a temporary increase in stock exchange fees that was attributable to the merger 
partly offsetting these increases were declines in the cost of directors and officers insurance coverage and transfer agent expense  reflecting economies of scale after the merger 
net income declined approximately  or in largely due to an increase in merger related expenses  an increase in advisory fees subsequent to the merger  and a decline in interest income caused by the sale of mortgage backed securities

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents aggregated  which the company believes is adequate to meet its short term operating cash requirements 
the company also has access to a revolving line of credit in the amount of million and holds  of mortgage backed securities 
at year end  there were no amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility 
during  the company s cash balance declined to  compared to  at december  this decline in cash reflects cash provided by operating activities of  plus cash provided by investing activities of  and reduced by cash used by financing activities of  the  of net cash provided by investing activities reflects  of proceeds from the sale of mortgage backed securities  which was partially offset by  used to acquire the lam research buildings   used for improvements to rental properties  and  used for leasing commissions 
the mortgage backed securities were sold in order to provide funds to purchase the dissenting shares as described below  and to pay for transaction and closing costs related to the property acquisition 
the  of net cash used in financing activities primarily reflects  of funds used to purchase the dissenting shares  and  of cash distributions 
the company s investment in mortgage backed securities at december   is represented by a fnma adjustable rate pass through certificate with a market value of approximately  although payments of principal and interest are guaranteed by fnma  changes in market interest rates may cause the security s market value to fluctuate  which could result in a gain or loss if the security is sold before maturity 
in  the company formed a limited partnership  fsrt  in order to acquire two industrial r d buildings located in fremont  california the lam research buildings 
fsrt assumed the existing financing on the lam research buildings  which was subsequently refinanced  and issued  limited partnership units to the prior owner in exchange for its equity interest in the buildings 
the limited partnership units are convertible into series a shares of the company s common stock on a one for one basis after november  the company contributed its fee title interest in the data general building to fsrt and approximately million in cash to cover transaction and closing costs 
the company is the sole general partner of fsrt and for its contribution  the company received an approximate ownership interest in the partnership 
the company may contribute all of its remaining properties to fsrt at some later date 
the company is subject to certain restrictions regarding the sale or refinance of properties owned by fsrt 
in connection with the merger  stockholders representing approximately  shares of freif series a common stock and  shares of company series a common stock elected to exercise dissenter s rights pursuant to chapter of the california general corporation law 
no advantage stockholders elected to exercise dissenter s rights 
on november   the company purchased all of the remaining dissenting shares of series a common stock arising from the merger for an aggregate price of million 
after giving effect to the transaction  the total number of shares of series a common stock of the company outstanding is  cash for the purchase price was provided by the sale of a portion of the company s mortgage backed securities 
on december   the company entered into an agreement with the bank of america for a million secured revolving line of credit to provide funding for future acquisitions and general business purposes 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus  or at the bank s reference rate at the company s option 
the credit facility is secured by mortgages on three of the company s properties which collectively accounted for of the company s annualized base rent as of december   together with the rental proceeds from such properties 
at december   these properties comprised approximately of the company s gross real estate assets 
the credit agreement contains customary representations  restrictive covenants  and events of default  including a covenant limiting quarterly distributions to of funds from operations 
the company does not anticipate that this covenant will adversely affect the ability of the company to declare distributions under the company s current distribution policy 
at december   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
in connection with any lease renewal or new leasing  the company would incur costs for tenant improvements and leasing commissions which would be funded first from operating cash flow and  if necessary  from cash reserves or the line of credit 
impact of inflation the company s policy of negotiating leases which incorporate operating expense pass through provisions is intended to protect the company against increased operating costs resulting from inflation 
inflation  however  would increase the company s borrowing costs 
potential factors affecting future operating results decline in interest income  loss on sale of mortgage backed securities in prior years  net income has been positively affected by interest income that the company earned on its investments in mortgage backed securities 
in addition  the company periodically incurred losses upon the sale of certain of the securities 
late in  the company liquidated substantially all of its mortgage backed securities in order to provide funds to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common stock 
therefore  the company does not anticipate generating significant amounts of interest income  or losses on the sale of mortgage backed securities  in future years 
the repurchase of the company s common stock was not detrimental to the company s operating results in calculated on a per share basis  due to the related decline in the number of shares outstanding 
leasing turnover in connection with any lease renewal or new lease  the company typically incurs costs for tenant improvements and leasing commissions which will be funded first from operating cash flow and  if necessary  from cash reserves or the line of credit 
in addition  while the company has historically been successful in renewing and releasing space  the company will be subject to the risk that leases expiring in the future may be renewed or released at terms that are less favorable than current lease terms 
leasing turnover continental casualty company an important event in the near term is the expiration of the continental casualty company cna lease in november  the lease covers  square feet of space and represents approximately of the company s current base rental income 
the company has commenced renewal negotiations with cna  however  it is currently unknown whether an agreement will be consummated 
currently  the base annual rental rate of this lease is per square foot  and the company has offered to extend the tenant s lease for five years at a lower rental rate 
the company has also offered to provide the tenant with tenant improvements and to pay leasing commissions  which total approximately  although it is impossible to predict the final outcome of negotiations with cna  if the tenant were to accept the company s proposal  the company s annual rental income and expense reimbursements would decline by approximately  or of the company s total revenue in alternatively  if cna were to vacate its space and a single replacement tenant could not be located  the company may have to reconfigure the space for multiple tenants at a cost which could exceed million 
the most likely sources for such funds are the company s cash reserves  debt financing  or the sale of an undeveloped parcel of land at the fairway center 
no assurance can be given that cna will renew under the terms set forth above or whether the space currently occupied by cna can be rented without detrimental impact to the company s current annual rental income and expense reimbursements 
leasing turnover data general building the data general building is located in an area of los angeles county that is dominated by aerospace and defense related companies 
because many of the defense programs that these companies are engaged in have been curtailed  their office space requirements were substantially reduced  causing greater vacancies and lower market rental rates 
based on reports from cb commercial real estate group  at december   the manhattan beach el segundo sub market  had a total vacancy factor of and an average asking full service rental rate of per square foot 
new leases and renewals that the company executes while these soft market conditions persist may be at lower rental rates and require greater tenant improvements than current leases at the property 
however  according to the cb commercial reports  the severe job losses experienced by the aerospace and defense industries appear to have bottomed out in february of  and occupancy rates in the el segundo market are expected to increase in no assurance can be given  however  that this will occur 
over the next two years  the company s leasing exposure at the data general building consists of two leases each covering  square feet  which expire in november  and january the company believes that the effective rental rate that is provided by the lease expiring in is substantially at the current market rate 
however  the lease expiring in carries a triple net rental rate that is equivalent to approximately per square foot on a full service basis 
compared to the current market asking rate of per square foot  this lease provides overmarket rent of approximately  annually  or of the company s total revenue in it is impossible to predict the market rental rate in  however  the company expects that when this lease expires  the rental income related to this space will be less than per square foot regardless of whether the lease is renewed or new leases are signed 
the company will also incur costs for tenant improvements and leasing commissions related to both spaces upon the renewal or re leasing of the spaces  however  the amounts are unknown at this time 
management believes that the company s sources of capital as described under liquidity and capital resources are adequate to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations to be a useful measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to support general operating expense and interest expense before the impact of certain activities  such as gains and losses from property sales and changes in the accounts receivable and accounts payable 
however  it does not measure whether income is sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  funds from operations is net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustment for unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company reports funds from operations in accordance with the revised nareit definition 
the change in the nareit definition in had no material effect on the amounts reported by the company as funds from operations in prior periods 
the measure of funds from operations as reported by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies that follow different definitions 
funds from operations dollars in thousands year ended december  net income    add depreciation and amortization    funds from operations    the primary difference between the periods reflects the changes in merger related expenses and losses on the sale of mortgage backed securities as discussed under results of operations
