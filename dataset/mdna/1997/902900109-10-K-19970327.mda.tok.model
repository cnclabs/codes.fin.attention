highlights operating results for the year ended december   reflect the company s emphasis on new business development and acquisition activities 
net income for the year  which included a number of one time charges and credits  was million  or per share  a percent increase over the million  or per share  earned in through business development efforts and acquisition activities the company grew from a resource base of billion in to over billion in resources at year end in the fourth quarter of  the company s principal banking subsidiary  ustrust  completed the purchase of twenty banking branches and assumption of million in deposit liabilities and repurchase agreements and million in loans from two local banking subsidiaries of bank of boston corporation the branch purchase 
also during the fourth quarter the company completed the sale of its connecticut banking subsidiary  ust bank connecticut ust conn 
other acquisition activities included the execution of an agreement to acquire walden bancorp  inc walden  a billion multi bank holding company headquartered in acton  massachusetts 
the walden acquisition was completed on january  refer to note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k for a further discussion of acquisitions and divestitures 
the one time charges and credits that influenced earnings included an earnings credit of million recorded through the provision for possible loan losses  which reflects the established quality of the loan portfolio 
refer to credit quality and reserve for possible loan losses for a further discussion of provisions and the reserve 
other one time items included a million gain from the sale of ust conn  million in acquisition related charges  and a million assessment on certain deposits insured by the savings association insurance fund saif 
the continued reduction in foreclosed asset and workout expense and reduced fdic insurance assessments were also major factors supporting the operating results 
financial condition at december  assets total assets at december  were billion  an increase of percent  or million from billion a year ago 
the increase was largely attributed to the loans and other assets acquired in the branch purchase  partially offset by the reduction in assets due to the sale of ust conn 
total loans increased million to billion reflecting million in loans acquired through the branch purchase and internal growth  reduced by million in connection with the ust conn sale 
internal net loan growth was approximately percent  or million  compared with a slight net reduction in loans of million  in federal funds sold increased million primarily supported by a similar increase in short term borrowings 
intangible assets increased million to million at year end reflecting a deposit premium paid in connection with the branch purchase 
the increase in premises  furniture and equipment reflects the fixed assets of the twenty additional branches acquired in the branch purchase 
partially offsetting these asset increases was a reduction in securities of million to million 
loans the following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio december  dollars in thousands commercial and financial      commercial real estate construction      developer  investor and land      consumer residential mortgage      home equity      indirect automobile installment      other consumer      lease financing      total loans      reserve for possible loan losses      indirect automobile installment loans represent loans purchased without recourse from automobile dealers which conform to the company s underwriting standards 
the company and its subsidiary banks do not engage in subprime automobile lending 
automobile loans made directly to consumers are not significant and are included with other consumer loans 
excluded from the loan balances at december  and were 
million and million  respectively  in loans held for sale  recorded at net realizable value and classified as other assets 
the loan portfolio mix changed significantly during the year 
as of december   total consumer loans represent percent of the company s loan portfolio while commercial and commercial real estate loans and leases represent percent 
this compares with a consumer loan percentage of percent and commercial loans and leases of percent in the increase in the consumer loan percentage reflects portfolio growth and portfolio additions from the branch purchase 
the company s commercial loan portfolios listed above totaled million at december   an increase of million from a year ago 
commercial loans acquired in the branch purchase totaled million while commercial loans sold in the ust conn sale were approximately million 
excluding the acquisition and divestiture activities  commercial loans decreased approximately million as normal amortization slightly outpaced new commercial loan volume during the year 
prior to the commercial loan portfolio had been experiencing a sharp decline due to the combination of normal amortization and the aggressive reduction of problem loans through collection  chargeoff  third party refinancing  or sale 
residential loans increased million during the year to million 
the increase reflects million of residential loans acquired in the branch purchase as reduced by normal amortization during the year and a million reduction in connection with the ust conn sale 
internal growth in residential mortgage loans in was minimal as the company elected to discontinue the origination of these loans 
the residential mortgage industry has become increasingly the purview of large scale providers which prompted the company s subsidiary banks  after careful consideration  to take such action 
with the exception of residential loans obtained through acquisition  future growth in this portfolio is not expected 
the strong growth in the indirect automobile portfolio of the prior two years continued in this portfolio totaled million at december   and reflects net growth of percent  or million  this year compared with growth of million last year 
the company s prime always home equity loan product and promotional campaign produced a percent net growth in that portfolio  or million 
such growth is net of a million reduction in connection with the ust conn sale 
the other consumer loan category increased million mostly due to acquired cash reserve advance accounts from the branch purchase 
the lease financing portfolio reflects growth of percent  or million during the year 
a portion of this growth  million  was directly related to the branch purchase 
loan maturity distribution the following table reflects the maturity and interest sensitivity of commercial and financial  and commercial real estate loans  at december  after year dollars in thousands year or less through years after years total commercial and financial     commercial real estate construction     developer  investor and land     interest sensitivity of above loans with predetermined interest rates     with floating interest rates     the company does not have an automatic rollover renewal policy for maturing loans 
renewal requests are reviewed and approved in substantially the same manner as applications by new customers for extensions of credit 
additionally  any renewal of a loan rated substandard or lower in the company s credit risk rating profile requires the controlled loan department head approval  and for certain size loans and circumstances  the approval of the senior credit committee and board of directors 
securities the decrease of million in securities was due to normal amortization  a million reduction in connection with the ust conn sale  sales of certain below market yielding securities  and net sales to accommodate cash flow requirements 
adding to the decrease was a change from an unrealized gain on securities available for sale of million at december  to an unrealized loss of million at december   a million decrease in fair value 
the decline in market value of the portfolio was directly related to the downward movement in bond prices experienced earlier in the year

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the change in the market value of securities available for sale also had the effect of decreasing stockholders investment by million since year end the unrealized gain reported as part of stockholders investment of million  net of tax at december   changed to an unrealized loss of million  net of tax at december  partially offsetting the above mentioned decreases to securities was the purchase of million in federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb stock by a banking subsidiary  ustrust 
the bank became a member of the fhlbb during the year and is required to invest in the fhlbb in an amount equal to the greater of percent of residential mortgage loans  including certain mortgage backed securities  or three tenths of percent of total assets or a specified percentage of outstanding advances 
the company has a policy of purchasing securities primarily rated a or better by moody s investors services and us government securities to minimize credit risk 
as of december   all of the company s mortgage backed securities were issued by agencies or sponsored agencies of the us government 
also at december   none of the company s mortgage backed securities would be classified as high risk under federal financial institutions examination council guidelines 
all securities  however  carry interest rate risk which affects their market value such that as market yields increase  the value of the company s securities declines and vice versa 
additionally  mortgage backed securities carry prepayment risk where expected yields may not be achieved due to an inability to re invest the proceeds from prepayment at comparable yields 
moreover  such mortgage backed securities may not benefit from price appreciation in periods of declining rates to the same extent as the remainder of the portfolio 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies of this form k for a further discussion of prepayment risk

mortgage backed securities are shown at or based on their final maturity but are expected to have shorter average lives

liquidity and funding liquidity involves the company s ability to raise or gain access to funds in order to fulfill its existing and anticipated financial obligations 
it may be provided through amortization  maturity or sale of assets such as loans and securities available for sale  liability sources such as increased deposits  utilization of the fhlbb credit facility  purchased or other borrowed funds  and access to the capital markets 
the company s securities portfolio is classified entirely as available for sale  which provides the flexibility to sell certain securities based upon changes in economic or market conditions  interest rate risk and the company s financial position and liquidity 
at december   liquidity  which includes excess cash  federal funds sold and unpledged securities  totaled approximately million  or percent of total assets  a million decrease from the funds needed to support the company s loan and securities portfolios are provided through a combination of commercial and retail deposits and short term borrowings 
total deposits increased million  or percent  to billion since december  the large increase in deposits was due to the assumption of million in deposits as part of the branch purchase partially offset by a reduction of million in connection with the sale of ust conn 
these significant events had the effect of increasing now  money market and regular savings deposits by million 
in addition  noninterest bearing deposits increased million and time deposits increased million 
as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents increased million during cash provided by operations resulted largely from net interest income from loans and securities  less the net difference of noninterest expense over noninterest income 
cash provided by financing activities was due principally to the net increases in deposits and in short term and other borrowings  offset in part by dividends paid and treasury stock acquisitions 
net cash used by investing activities was due to net increases in federal funds sold and loans offset in part by net cash acquired from the branch purchase  net proceeds from the sale of a bank subsidiary  and an excess of proceeds from the sales and maturities of securities over purchases of securities 
at december   the parent company had million in cash and due from banks and million in short term securities purchased under agreements to resell  compared with million cash and due from banks and million in short term securities purchased under agreements to resell at december  for the year ended december   the company received a total of million in dividends from its asset management and trust subsidiary  united states trust company ustc  million from ustrust  million from jsa financial corporation jsa  a nonbanking subsidiary of the company specializing in the liquidation of problem assets  and million from ust conn 
during the same period million was contributed to ustrust 
this capital contribution to ustrust facilitated the purchase of former bank of boston and baybank branches 
deposits the following table sets forth the remaining maturities of certificates of deposit in the amount of thousand or more at december  dollars in thousands less than three months  three to six months  six to twelve months  over twelve months  total  short term borrowings the company s short term borrowings consist primarily of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlbb borrowings 
these instruments are generally overnight funds 
december  for the year ended december  weighted average maximum amount average amount weighted average dollars in thousands balance interest rate at any month end outstanding interest rate federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlbb borrowings interest rate risk volatility in interest rates requires the company to manage interest rate risk which arises from differences in the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities 
management monitors and adjusts the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities gap position within various time frames 
an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities within a given time frame is considered asset sensitive positive gap and in time frames with more liabilities repricing than assets it is liability sensitive negative gap 
within gap limits established by the board of directors  the company seeks to balance the objective of insulating the net interest margin from rate exposure with that of taking advantage of anticipated changes in rates in order to enhance income 
the company s policy is to limit its one year cumulative gap position to times equity  presently equal to approximately percent of total assets 
the company has historically managed its interest rate gap primarily by lengthening or shortening the maturity structure of its securities portfolio 
the company s gap presentation may not reflect the degrees to which interest earning assets and core deposit costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
the company s rate sensitive assets consist primarily of loans tied to the prime rate and to a lesser extent the london interbank offered rate libor 
a small decline in the prime rate was realized during the first quarter of  which  along with a general external pressure on loan pricing  had the effect of a reduction in the company s yield on earning assets 
the following table summarizes the company s gap position at december  the majority of commercial loans  as well as home equity loans  are included in days as they reprice in response to changes in the interest rate environment 
interest bearing deposits are classified according to their expected interest rate sensitivity 
actual sensitivity of these deposits is reviewed periodically and adjustments are made in the company s gap analysis as management deems appropriate 
securities and noninterest bearing demand deposits are categorized according to their expected lives based on published industry prepayment estimates in the case of securities and current management estimates for demand deposits 
securities are evaluated in conjunction with the company s asset liability management strategy and may be purchased or sold in response to expected or actual changes in interest rates  credit risk  prepayment risk  loan growth and similar factors 
the reserve for possible loan losses is included in the over year category of loans 
at december   the one year cumulative gap position was positive at million  or approximately percent of total assets 
interest sensitivity periods dollars in millions days days days over year total loans  net of reserve  federal funds sold securities other assets total assets   interest bearing deposits  borrowed funds noninterest bearing deposits other liabilities and stockholders equity total liabilities and equity   gap for period cumulative gap as a percent of total assets capital there are three capital requirements which banks and bank holding companies must meet 
two requirements take into consideration risks inherent in assets for both on and off balance sheet items on a risk weighted basis risk based assets 
risk weightings are as determined by banking regulators for the industry as a whole 
under these requirements  the company must meet minimum tier and total risk based capital ratios capital  as defined in the regulations  divided by risk based assets of percent and percent  respectively 
tier capital is essentially shareholders investment  net of intangible assets and tier capital is the allowable portion of the loan loss reserve as defined and discounted subordinated debt 
total capital is the combination of tier and tier the third requirement is a leverage capital ratio  defined as tier capital divided by total average assets  net of intangibles 
all but the most highly rated banks are required to maintain a minimum of percent 
the company has not been notified of a specific requirement above the minimum 
all three capital ratios are calculated excluding the effect of sfas no 
and unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale 
as a condition to fdic approval of the acquisition of sixteen baybank branches  ustrust was required to have a tier leverage capital ratio of not less than i percent  no later than ten days after consummation of the acquisition of the baybank branches  and ii percent  no later than three months after acquisition of the baybank branches and for a period of six months thereafter 
the company currently anticipates that ustrust will maintain a tier leverage ratio equal to or in excess of the foregoing conditions 
in addition  the company expects that the foregoing conditions will not have a material adverse impact on the future operations of ustrust 
as of december   all of the subsidiary banks were well capitalized  with the exception of ustrust 
as of march   all of the subsidiary banks were well capitalized with the exception of ustrust which was adequately capitalized 
during a period from the consummation of the branch purchase in december  described in further detail under the caption entitled  recent developments acquisition of twenty bank of boston and baybank branches  in part i of this form k until march   ustrust s total capital to total risked based assets ratio temporarily fell below the requirement of an adequately capitalized bank 
the company made a capital contribution to ustrust on march  in order to meet this requirement 
for further discussion of capital requirements  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company declared quarterly cash dividends totaling million  or per share  to stockholders 
also  during the year the company received dividends from subsidiaries of million from ustc  million from ustrust  million from jsa financial corporation and million from ust conn  a former banking subsidiary sold during the year 
the company contributed capital of million to ustrust in to facilitate the branch purchase 
in  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program and the company adopted a shareholder rights plan 
the stock repurchase program was terminated in and all shares acquired thereunder were reissued 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for a discussion 
credit quality and reserve for possible loan losses at year end  the company had reduced the level of substandard loans to levels which were comparable to industry peer group averages 
while improvement in credit quality is no longer a major strategic focus  the company remains committed to the maintenance of its current credit standards and in ensuring the continued quality of the loan and lease portfolios 
this year the company was successful in further reducing the level of substandards from million at year end to million at december   a percent reduction 
loans reported as substandard include loans classified as substandard or doubtful  as determined by the company in its internal credit risk rating profile 
under the company s definition  substandard loans  which include loans on nonaccrual  are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the credit deficiencies are not corrected 
the substandard classification  however  does not necessarily imply ultimate loss for each individual loan so classified 
loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in substandard loans with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection of percent of the assets questionable and improbable 
at december   substandard and doubtful loans were million and 
million  respectively 
substandard loans include million of accruing commercial and commercial real estate loans  of which percent were current with respect to contractual principal and interest payments  and million in loans that were on nonaccrual and included in nonperforming assets 
all of the loans rated doubtful were on nonaccrual and included in nonperforming assets 
also  at december   loans rated special mention in the company s internal risk rating profile amounted to million  all of which were current 
special mention loans  as defined by the company  have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the assets 
as of year end  approximately percent of loans classified as substandard or doubtful were collateralized by real estate  and the remainder were collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and other business assets 
of the loans secured by real estate  approximately percent were collateralized by owner occupied commercial properties  approximately percent were collateralized by commercial real estate development  and approximately percent by residential real estate 
the remaining loans were collateralized by real estate under construction and raw land 
nonperforming assets the following table sets forth the company s total nonperforming assets and performance measures regarding key indicators of asset quality december  dollars in thousands nonperforming assets nonaccruals commercial and financial      commercial real estate construction   developer  investor and land      consumer residential mortgage    home equity  indirect automobile installment other consumer total nonaccrual      accruing loans days or more past due   other real estate owned oreo  net     restructured loans     total nonperforming assets      reserve for possible loan losses      net recoveries chargeoffs      oreo reserve   ratios reserve to nonaccrual loans reserve to total of nonaccrual loans  accruing loans days or more past due and restructured loans reserve to period end loans nonaccrual loans to period end loans nonaccrual loans and accruing loans over days past due to period end loans nonperforming assets to period end loans and oreo nonperforming assets to total assets net recoveries chargeoffs to average loans oreo reserve to oreo other real estate owned oreo represents assets to which title to the collateral has been taken through foreclosure or in settlement of loans

included in oreo are automobiles owned which are vehicles repossessed for reason of nonpayment 
the balance is stated at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or net realizable value 
restructured loans are those where interest rates and or principal repayments have been restructured to defer or reduce payment as a result of financial difficulties of the borrower 
as exhibited in the preceding table  the steep decline in nonperforming assets in the earlier years leveled off in nonperforming assets at december  of million were within industry norms relative to the company s size and total volume of loans 
nonaccrual loans increased from million last year to million at year end the december  balance includes a million loan to a single commercial borrower which paid off in the first quarter of with a minor chargeoff of loan principal 
restructured loans decreased from million last year to a nominal amount this year 
the improvement in asset quality and reduction in nonperforming loans has directly contributed to the decreasing amount of net chargeoffs recorded by the company 
in  the company recorded net recoveries of million 
nonaccrual loans were percent of total loans at december  compared with percent a year ago 
nonperforming assets were percent of total assets compared with percent last year 
at december   total impaired loans were million  comprised of 
million that required a reserve for possible loan losses of 
million and million that did not require a related reserve 
impaired loans  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  are commercial and commercial real estate loans recognized by the company as nonaccrual and restructured 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for a further discussion on sfas no 
the amount of interest on december  impaired loans that would have been recorded had the loans been paying in accordance with their original terms during was approximately million 
the amount of interest income on these loans included in net income in was approximately 
million 
credit quality monitoring credit quality within the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios of each subsidiary is quantified by an internal credit risk rating system designed to parallel regulatory criteria and categories of loan risk 
lenders monitor their loans to ensure appropriate rating assignments are made on a timely basis 
risk ratings and overall loan quality are also assessed on a regular basis by an independent loan review department which reports to the company s board of directors and its asset quality committee 
loan review personnel conduct ongoing portfolio trend analyses and individual credit reviews to evaluate loan risk and compliance with corporate lending policies 
results and recommendations from this process provide senior management and the board of directors and its asset quality committee with independent information on loan portfolio condition 
the asset quality committee monitors asset quality monthly and actively reviews the large credit exposures 
the company s commercial lending  credit and loan administration departments are charged with ensuring compliance with lending policies  procedures and administrative guidelines for the commercial portfolio 
in addition  an appraisal department reviews third party real estate loan collateral appraisals to ensure adherence to federal requirements and the company s lending policies 
there is a controlled loan department with specialized expertise in handling most of the company s nonaccrual and other troubled loans 
in order to ensure the effectiveness of credit quality monitoring systems  monitoring controls are periodically reviewed and tested by the company s internal audit department 
the credit quality of the lease financing receivables portfolio is measured by the same credit rating system described above 
consumer loan quality is evaluated on the basis of delinquent data due to the large number of such loans and relatively small size of individual credits 
historical trend analysis reports are reviewed on a monthly basis by senior lending officers and the company s board of directors 
past due nonconsumer loans  nonaccrual loans  and troubled debt restructurings are reviewed at least quarterly by a special assets committee whose membership includes the chief executive officer of the company  loan review department management and the most senior lending officers in the major lending and credit related divisions 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when there is doubt as to the collectibility of interest or principal  or if loans are days or more past due unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection 
in every case  a loan reaching days past due is placed on nonaccrual 
reserve for possible loan losses the company maintains a reserve for possible loan losses to absorb future chargeoffs of loans and leases in the existing portfolio 
the reserve is increased when a loan loss provision is recorded in the income statement 
when a loan  or portion thereof  is considered uncollectible  it is charged against the reserve 
recoveries on amounts previously charged off are added to the reserve when collected 
adequacy of the reserve for possible loan losses is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology which analyzes the size and risk of the loan and lease portfolio on a monthly basis 
factors in this analysis include historical loss experience and asset quality  as reflected by delinquency trends  nonaccrual and restructured loans and the company s credit risk rating profile 
consideration is also given to the current and expected economic conditions and  in particular  how such conditions affect the types of credits in the portfolio and the market area in general 
this analysis is documented using a combination of numerical and qualitative analysis and includes sensitivity testing and a written conclusion 
no portion of the reserve is restricted to any loan or group of loans  and the entire reserve is available to absorb realized losses 
the amount and timing of realized losses and future reserve allocations may vary from current estimates 
an allocation of the reserve for possible loan losses and ratio of loans in each category to total loans at december  through is presented below december  loans as a loans as a loans as a allocation percent of allocation percent of allocation percent of dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount of loan loss reserve commercial and financial    commercial real estate construction developer  investor and land    consumer    lease financing unallocated    total    december  loans as a loans as a allocation percent of allocation percent of dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount of loan loss reserve commercial and financial   commercial real estate construction   developer  investor and land   consumer   lease financing unallocated   total   consumer loans include indirect automobile installment loans  residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit  credit cards  and check credit loans 
the reserve for possible loan losses was million at december   a decrease of million from the million a year ago 
net chargeoffs of million in the first quarter of this year were offset with a similar amount of provision for possible loan losses 
in the second quarter the company realized million in net recoveries on loans previously charged off 
this  along with the company s risk rating and reserve adequacy indicators and continued improvement in asset quality  provided a basis to record a million credit provision in that quarter 
in the third quarter  upon receipt of final results from the federal and state regulatory agencies annual examination and following its internal analysis of reserve adequacy  the company recorded a million credit provision 
also during the third quarter  net recoveries of thousand were recorded 
in the fourth quarter of  net chargeoffs of thousand and the elimination of the million reserve of the sold banking subsidiary  ust conn  decreased the reserve to million at year end 
the million credit provision recorded to the reserve for possible loan losses during the year decreased the unallocated portion of the reserve from million  or percent of the reserve  a year ago to million  or percent of the reserve at december  the reserve requirement for the commercial loan portfolios was reduced million due to the combination of the favorable examination results which confirmed the company s internal risk rating indicators and reserve adequacy analysis  and the trend and level of recoveries 
the consumer loan reserve requirement increased million due to the acquisition of residential loans containing no delinquencies from the branch purchase and internal growth in indirect automobile loans and home equity loans 
as of december   the company s reserve ratios were more closely aligned with those of comparable institutions  as the reserve was percent of nonaccruals  percent of total nonperforming assets and percent of total loans

partially offsetting these favorable increases were million in acquisition related charges  a million one time saif deposit assessment  and increased salary and employee benefits expense

in order to make pretax yields comparable to taxable loans and investments  a tax equivalent adjustment is utilized 
the adjustment is based on a percent federal income tax rate in and  and percent in and includes applicable state taxes  net of federal tax benefit 
net interest spread is the excess of the interest rate on average earning assets over the interest rate on average interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the excess of the interest earned over interest expense divided by average earning assets 
as reflected in the foregoing table  the yield on loans  which was directly affected by the market rate decline and to a lesser extent by external pressure on loan pricing  decreased basis points from percent in to percent for the year ended december  the yield on securities was also affected by market interest rates and decreased basis points from percent to percent this year 
the combination of yield declines in loans and securities and  to a lesser degree  lower federal funds sold yields  resulted in a decline in yield on total earning assets of basis points from percent to percent 
as exhibited in the following table  the total effect of lower yields on interest income due to lower earning asset rates was a million decline from the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from last year to percent in deposit costs  the principal component of interest bearing liabilities  have remained relatively stable since the third quarter of this year s increase of basis points to percent in deposit costs reflects the carryover effect in of rising deposit rates during the first three quarters of cost of borrowings  which are almost entirely short term  decreased during the year consistent with interest rates 
the effect on total interest expense from changes in interest bearing liability rates from a year ago was a thousand decrease 
the net effect on net interest income from changes in rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was a decrease of million 
reflecting the decline in earning asset yield and a modest increase in liability costs  the interest margin and spread decreased from percent and percent  respectively  last year to percent and percent this year 
since reaching a historical peak in the first quarter of  both net interest margin and rate spread have been on a decline in concert with market interest rates and some pressure on loan pricing 
excluding the possible effects of future market interest rate changes  some continued narrowing of margin and spread is expected as the full impact of the branch purchase and walden acquisition are included in operating results 
net interest income  however  will benefit favorably from both transactions 
average earning assets for the year were billion  million higher than average securities volume was up million to million for the year while average loans outstanding increased million to billion 
when combined with reduced federal funds sold volume  total interest income increased million from due to changes in earning asset volume 
funding for the higher loan and securities volume was provided through an increase in average borrowings of million to million and deposit growth of million which was principally higher cost certificates of deposit 
in the aggregate  interest bearing liabilities increased million in to billion 
such increase added million in volume related interest expense over the net effect on net interest income from changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was an increase of million 
the following table attributes changes in interest income and interest expense to changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the year ended december  when compared with the year ended december  changes attributable to both rate and volume are allocated on a weighted basis

credit card processing expense increased thousand consistent with the increase in merchant credit card income described above 
the deposit insurance assessment was million in and includes a one time million savings association insurance fund assessment on former savings and loan association deposits held by a company subsidiary bank  ustrust 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for a further discussion of the deposit insurance assessment 
other noninterest expense  described below  increased million to million 
partially offsetting the aforementioned increases in expense was a sharp decrease from in foreclosed asset and workout expense of million to million this year  a direct benefit of the company s successful effort in the reduction of problem assets over the past few years 
other noninterest expense increased from million last year to million this year 
furniture and equipment expense increased thousand due to increased maintenance and depreciation expense on the company s investment in new computer related equipment and software 
the increase in legal and consulting of thousand was largely driven by the growth in home equity and indirect automobile loans and associated legal costs for new loan closings and collection activities 
in addition  a thousand nonrecurring charge for severance related consulting services of a former company executive was recorded during the year 
advertising and promotion increased thousand as a result of several successful promotional campaigns during the year for new loan products and deposit services as well as to increase the presence and awareness of the company s subsidiary bank  ustrust among the constituents of its market area 
this year s amortization of intangible expense includes one month  or thousand of amortization of core deposit intangibles related to the branch purchase 
all other noninterest expense increased million to million 
included this year was thousand in litigation provisions recorded for certain litigation matters that required accounting recognition  higher costs associated with the increased volume of consumer loans  and other miscellaneous operating costs 
slightly offsetting the aforementioned increases in other noninterest expense was the absence this year of million facility consolidation provisions recorded last year in connection with space consolidation  including the write off of leases and leasehold improvements on abandoned facilities 
year ended december  dollars in thousands furniture and equipment depreciation and maintenance   legal and consulting   advertising and promotion   amortization of intangibles   service bureau and other data processing   facility consolidation provisions  all other   total other noninterest expense   it is expected that noninterest expense  excluding one time items  will increase substantially next year as the full year s effect of the branch purchase overhead expenses are included 
in addition  the company expects to record a one time  pre tax restructuring charge in of approximately million in connection with the walden acquisition 
income taxes the company recorded income taxes of million in compared with million in the increase is the direct result of the significantly higher level of pre tax income recorded this year 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for a further discussion of income taxes 
as of december   included in other assets was a deferred tax asset of approximately million  which is expected to be realized against future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of these deferred assets 
fair value of financial instruments the methods and assumptions used by the company to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments as of december  and  in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  are discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
financial instruments do not include all of the assets and liabilities recorded on a company s balance sheet 
therefore  the aggregate fair value amounts of the financial instruments do not represent the underlying value of a company 
as a result of those assumptions and valuation methodologies  the estimated fair value of financial instrument assets and liabilities of the company as of december  was billion and billion  or million and million in excess of carrying value  respectively 
the estimated fair value of financial instrument assets and liabilities as of december  was billion and billion  or million and million in excess of carrying value  respectively 
the decrease in excess of fair value over the carrying value of financial instrument assets of million is attributed  in the opinion of management  to the million decrease in reserve for possible loan losses partially offset by the improvement in credit quality of the commercial loan portfolios and resulting reduction in credit risk 
the small decrease in excess of fair value over carrying value of financial instrument liabilities  is attributed  in the opinion of management  to the rollover of older certificates of deposit at the current higher rates 
comparison of with net interest income analysis the company s net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  million higher than the million in the increase reflects the positive effect on net interest income of a higher level of interest rates in compared with the average interest rate spread was relatively level with while the average interest rate margin was higher 
partially offsetting the effect of a stronger interest rate margin was a decline in the volume of earning assets  particularly loans  and a shift by deposit customers from savings products to higher cost certificates of deposit during interest rates moved downward in the second half of following a period of rapid interest rate rise from early through the first quarter of the result of s higher level of interest rates was an improvement in yield on earning assets of basis points from percent in to percent in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits  increased by basis points from percent in to percent in yields on prime based loans and federal funds sold  which reprice daily  reached their peak in the first quarter of and decreased steadily throughout the remainder of the year consistent with the movement of interest rates 
while the company initially refrained from increasing deposit rates in the rising interest rate environment of  to satisfy liquidity needs and in response to competition for deposits  a more aggressive deposit pricing was adopted in late and the first quarter of beginning with the second quarter and continuing through the rest of  the company moved to a less competitive pricing policy 
the result was a rising cost of deposits in early which subsided during the latter half of the year 
the interest rate spread in of percent was approximately equal with the spread of percent as the rise in yield on earning assets equaled the increase in cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate margin improved basis points to percent reflecting the positive impact of an equal rise in rates on the larger balance of average earning assets which totaled billion compared with interest bearing liabilities which totaled billion 
also contributing to the increased net interest rate margin was a reduction in interest bearing liabilities of million which exceeded a decrease in interest earning assets by million 
the net effect on net interest income from changes in rates in compared with was an increase of million 
average earning assets decreased million from billion in to billion in the decrease reflects declines in average loans of million and securities of million which was partially offset by an increase in lower yielding federal funds sold of million 
average interest bearing liabilities decreased million from to billion in in addition  interest bearing liabilities experienced a shift in the mix of average deposits from savings and money market deposits to higher cost certificates of deposit 
regular savings  now and money market deposits decreased million while time deposits increased million 
the net effect on net interest income from changes in volume of loans  deposits and other interest bearing balances in compared with was a decrease of million 
the following table attributes changes in interest income and interest expense to changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the year ended december  when compared with the year ended december  changes attributable to both rate and volume are allocated on a weighted basis 
increase decrease from year ended december  year ended amount due to changes in dollars in thousands december  total change volume rate interest income interest and fees on loans     interest on securities taxable    non taxable interest on federal funds sold and other    total interest income     interest expense interest on now  money market and regular savings deposits    interest on time deposits     interest on short term borrowings    interest on other borrowings total interest expense    net interest income     fully taxable equivalent at the federal income tax rate of percent and includes applicable state taxes net of federal benefit 
the tax equivalent adjustment on loans was approximately thousand and on non taxable securities was approximately thousand 
noninterest income total noninterest income was million in  a slight decrease of 
million from asset management fees decreased million due to timing differences in the recognition of fee income in and a slight decrease in the level of assets under management in compared to offsetting the lower asset management fees were increases in corporate services income  residual income on maturing equipment leases and higher realized gains from the sale of primarily equity securities held by a investment company subsidiary 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense was reduced million in to million compared to due largely to decreases in foreclosed asset and workout expense and deposit insurance assessments 
the lower level of problem assets in resulted in a million decrease in foreclosed asset and workout expense 
deposit insurance assessments decreased million in due to the reduction in insurance premium rates by the fdic 
salary and employee benefits increased million in to million 
the increase was largely due to a full year of asset management revenue sharing provisions in compared with only a half year provision in refer to the paragraph below for a further discussion of the revenue sharing provisions

million and million in expenses related to severance agreements for and  respectively 
in late and early  the company and senior executives of ustc s asset management division negotiated and entered into employment agreements designed to maximize the profitability and grow the assets under management of the asset management business 
the agreements are designed to increase the foregoing executives participation in the value created in the asset management business and  in a change in control situation  increase the likelihood that a prospective purchaser will retain the services of the executives 
certain provisions of the agreements became effective july   and contain revenue sharing provisions which permit the asset management division to use a specified percentage of its base revenues for the payment of expenses of the operation  including incentive compensation 
other noninterest expense was reduced 
million in to million 
included in other noninterest expense were provisions recorded in connection with space consolidation  including the writedown to market value of company facilities offered for sale and the writeoff of leases on abandoned facilities  lease subsidies and leasehold improvements 
the facility consolidation provisions were million in compared with 
million in in addition  the company in accelerated the amortization of certain core deposit intangible assets after conducting a review of the expected future economic benefits derived from these assets and their current carrying amount 
the amount of accelerated amortization expense recorded in was 
million 
this resulted in an increase in amortization of intangible asset expense of 
million compared with excluding such special items  other noninterest expense was reduced over percent  or million  in the largest reductions were in legal and consulting million and all other noninterest expense of million 
the decrease in all other noninterest expense was due to reductions across numerous expense categories  the largest were declines in appraisal fees  litigation expense and audit fees 
the major components of other noninterest expense were year ended december  dollars in thousands furniture and equipment depreciation and maintenance   legal and consulting   advertising and promotion   facility consolidation provisions  amortization of intangibles   service bureau and other data processing   all other   total other noninterest expense   cautionary statement regarding forward looking information the preceding discussion and notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k contain certain forward looking statements  including without limitation the statements regarding i the walden acquisition and associated amounts and timing of certain restructuring charges and effect on future operating results  and ii the full year effect on operating results from the branch purchase  and iii the company s expectations regarding the ability of its principal banking subsidiary ustrust in meeting the bank s regulatory capital conditions and requirements 
moreover  the company may from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements by company management  express its expectations regarding future performance of the company and estimates of the effects of its acquisition activities 
these forward looking statements are inherently uncertain  and actual results may differ from company expectations 
risk factors that could impact current and future performance include but are not limited to i changes in asset quality and the resulting credit risk related losses and expense  ii adverse changes in the economy of the new england region  the company s primary market  which could further accentuate credit related losses and expenses  iii since most of the company s loans are concentrated in eastern massachusetts and a substantial portion of these loans have real estate as primary and secondary collateral  adverse changes in the local real estate market can also negatively affect credit risk  iv the company operates in an increasingly competitive new england financial services marketplace  where a large number of bank acquisitions and mergers has resulted in fewer but much larger and financially stronger competitors which could alter company expectations  v fluctuations in market rates and prices can negatively affect net interest margin  asset valuations and expense expectations  and vi as a bank holding company  the company and its subsidiary banks are subject to changing regulatory requirements of federal and state agencies that could materially impact future operations of the company
