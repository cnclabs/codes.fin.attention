item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal was a record year for apogee 
we achieved sharply improved profitability on a moderate sales increase 
as stated last year  we had undertaken companywide efforts to improve margins  productivity  working capital usage and  in particular  capital allocation 
the success of these efforts in fiscal allowed us to easily exceed the earnings per share growth goal of noted in this space a year ago 
our efforts and performance are further detailed in this financial review 
we continue to believe that with reasonably stable competitive and economic conditions  apogee can produce improved earnings at a compounded annual rate of or greater 
performance fiscal compared to fiscal the following table illustrates the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for each of the three years in the three year period ended march  percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest and other expense  net earnings before income taxes and other items income taxes equity in net loss earnings of affiliated companies minority interest net earnings led by our glass technologies gt and auto glass ag segments  consolidated net sales grew to million in fiscal gt s sales grew primarily due to continued strong demand and firm pricing for its fabricated architectural glass products and the addition of sales from the acquired viratec thin films viratec unit 
despite a very challenging industry environment  our ag segment increased sales by combining same store sales growth of with additional retail and wholesale locations and strong sales growth at curvlite 
building products services bps revenues were essentially unchanged from a year ago and represented the lowest percent of apogee s total sales in over years 
fiscal comprised weeks  the additional week accounting for approximately of the consolidated net sales that year  while fiscal comprised weeks 
overall  cost of sales  as a percent of sales  fell 
slight productivity gains at most of our operations  sharply lower insurance costs due to reserve reductions and a significant change in sales mix away from the low margin curtainwall construction activity of bps new construction unit combined to produce this positive variance 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew  reflecting increased information systems and marketing costs  particularly at our ag segment  and higher profit sharing and commission expense related to higher sales and improved profitability 
as a result  sg a costs as a percent of sales rose  despite the moderate sales gain and productivity measures undertaken by our operating segments 
net interest expense rose  primarily due to the impact of interest paid associated with the settlement of outstanding tax matters 
our effective tax rate dropped to from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the tax benefits related to higher export sales levels and the resolution of prior years tax examinations 
these items were partially offset by foreign operating losses for which no tax benefit was recognized 
as explained below  the inclusion of of the results of marcon coatings marcon and viratec in our consolidated financial statements means that equity in net earnings of affiliates in no longer included a interest in those units 
the  charge to earnings in fiscal reflected our share of net losses recorded by various affiliated companies in which we have a or less equity stake 
minority interest rose due to a larger loss at harmon europe sa  our owned french subsidiary 
consolidated net earnings advanced in fiscal to million  or a share  from million  or a share  a year ago 
return on shareholders equity rose to from a year earlier 
the above per share figures reflect the two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  paid to shareholders on february  segment analysis the following information provides a more detailed look at each of our three segments 
also see business segment information on page for a five year history of each segment s sales and operating earnings 
glass technologies gt includes viracon  our architectural glass fabricator  tru vue  our picture framing glass and matboard fabricator  and viratec which applies optical grade coatings to glass and other substrates 
as described below  viratec was acquired along with marcon  which applies coatings to architectural and residential building glass and has since been merged into viracon s operations 
beginning in march  marcon and viratec were consolidated with our other majority owned business units 
through fiscal  our equity in marcon s and viratec s net earnings was included in the consolidated results of operations under the caption equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 
gt improved sales and earnings for the fifth consecutive year  exceeding last year s record results 
sales rose by  while operating earnings improved to million 
the sales increase was due to continued strong demand and firm pricing for its fabricated architectural glass products and the addition of sales from the acquired viratec unit 
while the segment contributed just of consolidated revenues  it provided of our consolidated operating income 
viracon experienced continued strong demand for its architectural glass products 
this unit ran at or near full capacity for most of the year 
viracon s operating income grew by 
production capacity was added in and additional increases are planned for tru vue posted marginally improved sales and operating income in these results occurred against a backdrop of soft industry sales 
the unit was successful in controlling costs and made progress toward integrating its matboard operations with its picture framing glass business 
on a pro forma basis  viratec saw its sales fall  although year end order activity reflected higher incoming order rates 
in fiscal  industry pricing pressure for its flat glass coated products and viratec s inability to reach operating profitability for its direct coat business combined to reduce operating income when compared to a year ago 
at march   viratec s backlog of million was more than double last year s million year end backlog 
in january  we agreed to pay our joint venture partner jv partner million for its interest in marcon viratec and certain leased assets 
this agreement also included the irrevocable release of both parties from all outstanding claims related to the litigation described in the glass technologies section of this financial review comparing fiscal to fiscal as a result of the march court order requiring the jv partner to sell its interest in marcon viratec to apogee  marcon viratec was consolidated in our financial statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal based on current order rates and industry conditions for the segment s viracon and viratec units  we anticipate that gt will report improved sales and earnings in fiscal gt will continue to invest in expanded production capacity  particularly at its viracon unit 
auto glass ag reported modestly improved results in fiscal the segment sales grew during the year despite intense competition and lower unit movement in the replacement auto glass industry 
operating income increased 
this increase resulted mainly from the above mentioned increase in sales  which more than offset the increase in information systems and marketing expense associated with the segment s drive to expand market coverage and develop new services to meet customers needs 
ag  which operates retail stores under the harmon autoglass harmon name and distribution centers under the glass depot name  possesses the third largest market share in the auto glass repair and replacement industry 
insurance companies continue to prefer vendors who can expedite claims processing and other administrative efforts related to auto glass replacement and repair 
the segment s significant investment in information systems provides harmon the means to offer comprehensive claims processing and management services to these customers on a nationwide basis 
curvlite  ag s auto glass fabricator  increased sales in fiscal by over 
the unit s national distribution center  which in fiscal began to offer other manufacturers products as well as its own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  and autoglass express  a new delivery system which allows curvlite to fill customer orders more quickly and completely  accounted for much of the unit s sales growth 
about of curvlite s sales are made to glass depot units 
in january  harmon completed its acquisition of portland glass  a location auto glass replacement chain operating in the northeast us this acquisition  combined with other locations added during the year  increased the number of locations to harmon retail locations and glass depot distribution centers 
at march   ag also had midas muffler franchises 
with the addition of locations acquired in the portland glass acquisition and further unit growth from other start up or acquired locations and market penetration  ag expects to increase sales in fiscal as the segment begins to better leverage its significant investment in information and delivery systems 
however  the uncertainty of industry unit sales and pricing makes it difficult to project operating earnings 
building products services bps posted its first operating profit in five years in fiscal  recording earnings of million 
overall revenues were flat compared to a year ago 
higher sales by our detention security  full service and architectural products units were offset by lower domestic new construction revenues and the absence of sales from the nanik window coverings businesses sold last year 
overseas revenues grew marginally for the year 
other than the segment s european operations  each of bps operating units recorded solid operating earnings improvement compared to a year ago 
harmon  ltd  bps domestic and international new construction unit  experienced flat results as the domestic and asian operations improved earnings were offset by a large operating loss in europe 
the european loss reflected high risk projects taken and executed at unacceptably low margins 
the improvement in operating earnings by our domestic and asian new construction units was achieved through overhead and operating cost reductions and by a newly implemented monitoring system which allows money saving decisions to be made earlier in a project s completion cycle 
the segment s full service unit had another solid year  generating higher sales and healthy operating income 
the detention security unit reported higher revenues and significantly greater income in fiscal however  its year end backlog was down from a year earlier 
the architectural products unit leveraged its higher sales into sharply higher profitability as the unit improved its engineering and fabrication productivity 
we ended the fiscal year with a million backlog  down from million at the end of fiscal bps backlog is almost of the total 
based upon analysis of its backlog  bps anticipates lower sales in fiscal although better project margins are expected  the smaller revenue base makes prospects for improved operating earnings next year dependent upon bps ability to control costs  effectively manage projects  maintain margins inherent in the segment s backlog and book additional contracts  both domestically and internationally 
approximately million of the february backlog will not be reflected as revenue in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales grew to million in fiscal as all three segments reported double digit gains 
our gt segment benefited from improved volume and firm pricing for its fabricated architectural glass products  while our ag segment experienced higher unit volumes at a greater number of locations 
ag s sales improvement was somewhat dampened by the continuation of industry pricing pressure 
bps sales grew mainly due to higher overseas building activity 
approximately of the consolidated net sales came from an additional week in the week fiscal compared to a week fiscal overall  cost of sales  as a percent of sales  grew slightly as productivity gains at gt were offset by narrowing margins at our ag segment 
sg a costs grew  reflecting increased information systems and marketing costs at our ag segment as it worked to expand market coverage and develop new services to meet customers needs 
however  sg a costs as a percentage of sales fell sharply  due to strong sales gains and cost cutting measures undertaken by all of our operating segments 
net interest expense rose due to a combination of higher interest rates and higher borrowing levels in the first half of the year necessitated by our working capital needs 
our effective tax rate dropped to from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the tax benefits related to higher export sales levels and a decrease in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
equity in net earnings of affiliates dropped slightly as pricing for certain coated products became more competitive in the latter half of the year  and continuing development costs at viratec offset solid earnings from its main product line 
minority interest rose due to a larger loss at harmon europe sa  our owned french subsidiary 
consolidated net earnings advanced in fiscal to million  or a share  from million  or a share  a year earlier 
return on shareholders equity rose to from a year earlier 
glass technologies gt included viracon  our architectural glass fabricator  and tru vue  our picture framing glass manufacturer  in fiscal  both previously part of bps 
in fiscal  our equity in marcon viratec was reported in the consolidated results of operations under the caption equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 
gt had outstanding results in fiscal  increasing revenues and operating income by and  respectively 
while the segment contributed just of consolidated revenues  it provided of consolidated operating income 
much of the segment s success was due to our viracon operation  which ran at or near full capacity for most of the year 
in fiscal  viracon grew revenues and operating income by and  respectively 
additional capacity was planned to be on line in fiscal viracon s cost structure  along with the expansion  was expected to allow the unit to begin to penetrate the medium performance architectural glass market  a market which is approximately two times the size of the high performance architectural glass market  viracon s traditional market 
tru vue had similar results  increasing revenue and earnings by and  respectively 
the unit was able to achieve the growth through efforts to streamline operations and integrate the two year old matboard acquisition 
both marcon and viratec increased revenues over the prior year 
marcon had a decline in operating income  as start up expenses related to a new coater negatively affected earnings 
viratec was able to grow operating income despite pricing pressures for its flat glass operations and developmental costs related to the cart line 
at march   viratec s backlog of million was down from the prior year end 
in november  our jv partner in marcon viratec commenced litigation against us  alleging claims for damages and seeking to have the court order us to sell our interest to the jv partner 
we filed counterclaims seeking to have the jv partner s interest sold to us and in march  the court ordered the jv partner to sell the shares of stock representing its interest in marcon viratec to us upon payment of fair value for those shares as determined by the court 
the jv partner s rights and status as shareholder and directors were terminated as of the effective date of the order and the fair value for the shares was to be determined by the court after further proceedings 
at march   the court had not yet scheduled a trial or hearing to determine fair value 
at a hearing on april   the court ordered us to post a bond or letter of credit in the amount of million  or to pay the jv partner million and agree to set aside an additional million  as security for the ultimate payment of the purchase price for the jv partner s shares 
the amount of such a bond or other means was intended as security and was not intended to reflect the court s view on what was the fair value for the shares 
the jv partner s claims against us for damages were still pending and the court also was considering a motion brought by the jv partner to add a claim for punitive damages 
we anticipated gt would report sales and earnings gains in fiscal through expanded production capacity and streamlined operations for viracon and tru vue 
we believed full control of marcon and viratec would allow us more strategic and operating flexibility 
auto glass ag had mixed results in fiscal the segment grew sales during the year despite pricing pressures and lower unit movement in the auto glass industry 
operating income declined due to lower margins and expenses related to investment in improved information systems and marketing programs 
the segment increased market penetration in fiscal as harmon glass grew by retail locations while glass depot added distribution centers 
at march   ag had harmon retail glass stores  glass depot locations and midas muffler franchises in states 
increasingly  insurance companies were relying on auto glass vendors with sophisticated information systems to expedite claims processing and other administrative efforts related to auto glass replacement and repair 
this outsourcing allowed insurance companies to improve customer satisfaction and lower costs 
the segment s significant investment in information systems provided harmon the means to offer comprehensive claims processing and management services to these customers on a nationwide basis 
harmon was able to use this competitive edge to gain market share in fiscal this market share gain was reflected in harmon s jump in retail same store sales as contrasted with a drop in overall industry unit movement 
curvlite  ag s auto glass fabricator  reported increased sales and unit volume in a declining sales price market 
however  weaker pricing and costs related to setting up its new product and delivery systems negatively affected operating income 
through the unit s national distribution center  a mega distribution center offering other manufacturers products as well as its own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  curvlite was able to offer a more complete product line to its customers 
another program introduced in fiscal was autoglass express  a delivery system which allowed curvlite to fill customers orders on an individual basis more completely and faster than many of its competitors 
the unit believed the two new initiatives would give it a competitive edge and help to gain market share 
ag anticipated sales growth to continue as it started to leverage its information and delivery systems in fiscal even with higher sales  it was difficult to project if operating earnings would improve as the full costs of the information systems would be realized in fiscal and industry pricing pressures were expected to continue 
building products services bps made substantial progress in fiscal revenues grew  primarily due to progress on the kuala lumpur city centre project in malaysia and higher european revenues 
the segment s operating loss fell from prior year s million to million 
harmon  ltd  bps domestic and international curtainwall construction unit  reduced its loss approximately  while the segment s architectural products unit reported modest operating income compared to a loss a year earlier and revenue growth 
both units improvements were achieved through overhead and operating cost reductions and by newly implemented monitoring systems which allowed money saving decisions to be made earlier in a project s completion cycle 
the segment s full service unit had another solid year generating strong revenues and healthy operating income 
bps detention security unit reported lower revenues  but produced a small profit  though notably less than a year earlier 
however  the unit s year end backlog was up over a year ago 
in july  bps sold the nanik window coverings unit for million 
a million gain on the sale was included under the caption  other expense  net in the consolidated results of operations 
in fiscal  the nanik window coverings unit contributed of segment sales and a small operating profit compared to of sales and a million operating profit in fiscal apogee ended the fiscal year with a million backlog  up from million at the end of fiscal bps backlog was about of the total 
based upon analysis of its backlog  bps anticipated nominal sales growth in fiscal due to the increased selectivity of projects taken over the prior year 
in addition  better margins were expected as the segment completed its remaining older  lower margin projects and progressed further with healthier margin projects 
approximately million of the february backlog was not expected to be reflected as revenue in fiscal liquidity and capital resources financial condition major balance sheet items as a percentage of total assets at march  and march  are presented in the following table percent of total assets current assets current liabilities long term debt other liabilities shareholders equity net receivables rose million  or  primarily due to increased sales activity and higher contract receivable billings  the latter of which is offset by the million increase in billings in excess of costs and earnings on uncompleted contracts 
all but a nominal amount of the million growth in inventories reflected acquired businesses  while costs and earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts were essentially unchanged 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  reflecting higher levels of operating activity and the assumed liabilities of acquired units 
total long term debt stood at million at march   up million from a year earlier 
despite the million of cash flow provided by operating activities  additional borrowing was required to finance capital expenditures and the acquisition of marcon viratec 
in may  we obtained a new five year  multi currency  committed credit facility of million 
for fiscal  we believe our continued efforts to reduce working capital relative to sales growth plus our currently available credit facilities will enable us to maintain liquidity while achieving improved results 
capital investment new capital investment in fiscal totaled million  versus million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
expenditures for new property  plant and equipment totaled million  and consisted of information systems  facility expansions and manufacturing equipment additions and upgrades 
as previously mentioned  we paid million to complete the acquisition of marcon viratec 
we also invested million to fund ag s acquisition of retail stores and wholesale depots  million of which was funded by the issuance of our common stock 
capital investment for fiscal is estimated at million 
further upgrading of information and communication systems is a primary component for all the segments 
gt s plans also include expenditures for capacity expansion and productivity improvements 
shareholders equity our book value per share rose in fiscal from to  with outstanding common shares increasing by three percent 
net earnings less dividends  along with common stock issued in connection with stock based compensation plans and the portland glass acquisition  essentially accounted for the increase in book value per share 
during fiscal  we increased our quarterly dividend by  to cents per share  our nd consecutive year of increase 
the above figures all reflect the two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend paid to shareholders on february  impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
however  since the cost of many of our inventories is determined using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting  cost of sales  except for depreciation expense included therein  generally reflects current costs 
year end prices were essentially unchanged from a year ago for the cost of glass  one of our primary raw materials 
we expect the cost of glass to rise moderately in fiscal aluminum prices at year end were slightly lower than a year ago 
while our construction and supply contracts are at fixed prices  the material components are usually based on firm quotes obtained from suppliers 
labor cost increases  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose moderately in fiscal and a moderate increase also can be reasonably anticipated for the new year 
other costs are actively managed to minimize the inflationary pressures that exist in the markets for goods and services our businesses require for operation 
outlook we believe that improving market conditions for nonresidential construction  flat demand for automotive replacement glass and continued strong demand for architectural glass and coated glass products will allow us to improve earnings in fiscal better project selection and management  continued cost containment programs and efficiencies  and competitive advantages from information management technology should contribute to earnings growth
