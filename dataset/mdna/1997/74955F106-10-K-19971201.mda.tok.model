item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general rfm designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of rf components and modules for the low power component  low power virtual wire r radio system  frequency control module and filter product areas 
the company s products are based on saw technology  and the company s strategy is to leverage its rf design skills to provide saw based solutions to the current and emerging needs of the electronics industry 
the company s products include more than resonators  filters  high frequency clocks  oscillators  and transmitter and receiver modules 
the company s average selling prices within these product lines generally range from less than to for low power products components and radio systems  to for frequency control modules and to for filter products 
during fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal  the company constructed and tested its new surface mount technology smt manufacturing facility 
the purpose of the facility is to provide the capability to manufacture products utilizing surface mount packaging in a highly automated environment 
during this period  the facility had not reached production status  so the related equipment was not placed into service  and certain associated costs were capitalized as start up costs 
the related costs were included in property and equipment as construction in progress 
in the third quarter of fiscal  this facility achieved production status 
accordingly  depreciation on the equipment and amortization of capitalized start up costs began 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled business  legal proceedings and selected financial data in this report 
results of operations the following discussion relates to the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended august  current year or fiscal  in comparison to the fiscal year ended august  prior year or fiscal  as well as the fiscal year ended august  fiscal 
in addition  there is discussion of the financial statements for the three months ended august  fourth quarter  in comparison to the three months ended august  comparable quarter of the prior year 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended august i the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of income to total sales and ii the percentage change in these items from year to year percentage of sales year to year change to to sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income sales the following table sets forth the components of the company s sales and percentage relationship of the components to total sales for the periods indicated year ended august  amount of total amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands product sales low power components    virtual wire r radio systems   frequency control modules    filter    total product sales    technology development total sales    product sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal  primarily because of increased units shipped of the company s low power component and filter products 
low power component sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal a significant portion of the and increase was due to the demand for the company s surface mount resonator products particularly to customers in automotive markets 
in fiscal  the company brought its new smt facility to production status  with gradually increasing production levels during fiscal  and the company believes that the markets for its low power component products is approximately million and is growing in terms of unit volume 
these markets have attracted a number of large international competitors  particularly for the automotive segment 
the increased competition has resulted in lower average selling prices in many cases 
the company believes that the impact of lower average selling prices may be significant enough in future periods to offset the impact of selling an increased number of units 
there can be no assurance that sales for low power components will continue to increase  or even stay at the same level they have been in previous periods 
the company has devoted a considerable amount of its capital  technical  sales and marketing resources into the virtual wire r radio systems products 
it has developed and released to manufacturing status more than individual product variations of virtual wire r radio products 
the company believes these types of products provide an opportunity to exploit its proprietary technology and pursue its strategy of focusing on value added products 
the company is helping more than potential customers to incorporate these products into a wide variety of new applications 
the timing of when any sales resulting from such new applications reach the production phase is dependent upon the timing of both the customers product development cycles and their product introduction cycles 
there can be no assurance as to when or even if these new products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
filter sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal as a result of increased demand from customers in the telecommunications and wireless lan markets 
in future periods  the company will devote significant resources to developing and supporting the growth of its filter products 
the product development and introduction cycle for filter products takes between six months to a year to complete  therefore  the timing of any revenue in this area is unpredictable 
there can be no assurance as to when or if this strategy to focus on filter products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
frequency control module sales decreased in fiscal and in fiscal these products accounted for only of total sales in fiscal  compared to in and in fiscal frequency control module sales in prior years predominately included sales to the company s then largest customer  digital equipment corporation digital  for use in systems based on the alpha microprocessor 
sales to digital decreased in fiscal  and  primarily as a result of lower average selling prices  as this customer converted to lower priced units and  more recently  due to reduced sales units 
the lower priced units  in  represented a new line of clock oscillator products that were introduced to respond to price competition from products that utilize phase lock loop technology 
digital accounted for approximately   and of total sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s top five customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
over the last two fiscal years  a significant portion of the increased sales for the company s new smt products were due to new customers  which increased the total number of customers receiving rfm products 
no single customer accounted for more than of total sales in the reduction in the relative portion of sales to the company s top five customers from to largely reflects the reduction in sales to the company s then largest customer  digital 
international sales primarily in europe and asia were approximately of the company s total sales during fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal and in fiscal the company considers all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
these sales are denominated primarily in us currency 
the company intends to continue its focus on international sales in the future and expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that this can be achieved 
while the company has achieved sales increases in prior periods  there can be no assurance that this can be achieved in future periods 
the company s success is highly dependent on achieving technological advances in its product design and manufacturing capabilities  as well as its ability to sell its products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors such as economic and regulatory conditions 
the company experiences increased competition from companies that offer alternative solutions such as phased locked loop technology 
there can be no assurance that competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating the company s technologies will not adversely affect selling prices and market share 
gross profit margin gross profit margin increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased gross profit margin for the company s low power component and filter products 
margins for these products increased primarily due to a decrease in per unit manufacturing costs which were the result of improved production processes that increased yields and productivity  and increased demand creating an increase in the number of units produced 
the increased number of units produced allowed relatively high fixed overhead costs to be lower on a per unit basis  particularly for the new smt facility 
in  low power products experienced a decrease in average sales price as a result of competitive pressures 
this was not experienced in fiscal when improved gross profit margins were aided by increased average selling prices as a result of changes in product mix within this product line 
there can be no assurance  however  that the trend toward lower per unit manufacturing costs  that occurred in recent years  will continue 
if average selling prices were to decrease faster than per unit manufacturing costs decrease  then the company s gross profit margins would be adversely impacted 
the improvement in low power gross profit margins in both and was partially offset by a reduction in gross profit for the higher margin frequency control module products 
historically  the company has achieved substantially higher gross profit margins on its frequency control module products than its low power products due in part to the higher engineering and technical content of the frequency control module products 
these products accounted for only of total sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decline in sales to digital accounted for most of this impact 
in addition  lower average selling prices for these products caused a decline in gross margins  despite lower per unit manufacturing costs 
the company has in the past experienced sudden increases in demand which have put pressure on its manufacturing facilities to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than the company currently possesses 
the company has devoted the bulk of its capital expenditures to increase capacity and improve its manufacturing processes 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to increase its manufacturing capacity and improve its manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this would result in a loss of potential sales in the periods impacted 
research and development research and development expenses increased approximately in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in both fiscal and was due to increased staffing to support the increased sales growth of the company and increased emphasis on process engineering and document control process for its operations 
since sales increased comparably to research and development expenses  such expenses maintained a level at of total sales in fiscal and the company believes that the continued development of its technology and new products is essential to its success and is committed to continuing its investment in research and development  which is expected to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased approximately in fiscal and in fiscal these increases were due primarily to increased resources in the form of sales representative organizations and to increased sales commissions and marketing costs needed to support the company s increased sales 
since sales increased comparably to sales and marketing expenses  such expenses maintained a level of in fiscal and fiscal the company expects to incur higher sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in future periods as it expands its sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately in fiscal and in fiscal such increases were primarily attributable to continued increased support for the company s expansion and increased costs for write offs of certain receivable accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to incur bad debt write offs as it expands its business to new customers and new geographic areas 
the company currently expects general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
since sales increased faster than general and administrative expenses  such expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal other income expense during the current year  the company repaid portions of its indebtedness as cash generated from operations allowed 
this decrease in indebtedness caused a decrease in interest expense for fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulting in a net reduction of other income 
income tax expense the company s income tax expense was million in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  and  in fiscal fiscal included the one time favorable impact of  
per share  resulting from recognition of research and development tax credits 
the company s effective tax rate  exclusive of the fiscal one time tax credit  was approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
earnings per share net income increased to million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the company s earnings per share was 
per share for fiscal  compared to 
per share for fiscal and 
per share for fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note of the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter increased to million  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
the overall sales increase was primarily due to an increase in low power component products and filter products sales of approximately and  respectively  compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this was primarily due to an increase in the number of units shipped  particularly for new smt type products for automotive customers 
gross profit margins were in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this was primarily due to improvement in margins for the low power component product line  resulting from a continued reduction in per unit manufacturing costs for those products  particularly the new smt products 
this reduction in cost was due to increased productivity  improvements in yield and an increased number of units produced  allowing for fixed overhead expenses to be allocated over a larger number of units 
operating income for the fourth quarter was million  or of total sales 
this compares to million  or of total sales  for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of total sales was due to gross margins improving and revenues increasing faster than operating expenses 
operating expenses increased  in the fourth quarter  compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this increase was due to the additional costs of supporting the company s increased level of sales  increases in product and market development programs and system development programs 
earnings per share was 
in the fourth quarter  compared to 
for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources of liquidity at august   consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and million of unused credit facilities 
the unutilized portion of the credit facilities includes million under a line of credit agreement and million under an equipment collateralized operating lease facility 
the equipment collateralized operating lease facility was to be advanced in stages prior to december   and the company is currently under negotiations to extend the current terms and conditions through the end of fiscal year the credit facilities contain financial covenants and restrictions relating to various matters  including a minimum net worth requirement  a minimum ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense and current maturity of the term loan  a minimum quick ratio and a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
as of august   the company was in compliance with such covenants and restrictions 
net cash from operations increased to million due to a million increase in net income and noncash items included in net income  such as depreciation and amortization  offset by 
million additional cash used in working capital  such as trade accounts receivable and inventory 
cash used in investing activities in the current year was million 
fiscal year and capital acquisitions included significant purchases of property and equipment to enhance the company s manufacturing facilities 
the company expects to acquire approximately million to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal  consisting primarily of equipment needed for its manufacturing facilities 
some of this equipment may be acquired under an equipment collateralized operating lease facility 
net cash used in financing activities was 
million in and 
million in funds raised from operations and exercises of stock options were mostly used to repay other debt and acquire property and equipment 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  if any  banking facilities  and the million balance in cash and short term investments will be sufficient to meet the company s operating cash requirements through fiscal to the extent that these sources of funds are insufficient to also meet the company s capital expenditure requirements  the company will be required to raise additional funds 
no assurance can be given that additional financing for capital expenditures will be available or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms
