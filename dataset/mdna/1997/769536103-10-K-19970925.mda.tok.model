item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
general the company operates on a week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to june th 
this period is utilized because it closely coincides with the rice crop year in the southern united states and rice is the largest component of the company s business 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage a portion of its exposure to currency fluctuations related to inventory purchases 
these instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  accordingly  gains and losses on these instruments are deferred and included in the basis of the inventory hedged 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge specific product commitments 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding twelve months and are settled at maturity based on rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts 
at june  the company had established bank lines available to purchase forward exchange contracts in the amount of million  of which million was outstanding 
gains and losses deferred in outstanding instruments at year end were immaterial 
as a matter of policy  the company does not engage in foreign currency speculation and does not hedge to protect the translated results of foreign operations or other economic exposures for which speculative accounting treatment of the hedging instrument would be required 
the company operates in various foreign countries and is therefore subject to currency fluctuations 
changes in the value of the united states dollar against these currencies will affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
when the united states dollar strengthens compared to other local currencies  the operating results of the company s foreign units translate into fewer united states dollars  thus decreasing the revenues and expenses of the company on a consolidated basis 
if the united states dollar weakens against the other relevant currencies  the opposite occurs 
the company s foreign units attempt to minimize the effects of currency risk by borrowing externally in the local currency and by hedging their limited purchases made in foreign currencies when that option is available 
as a matter of policy  the company does not engage in currency speculation 
changes in exchange rates historically have not materially impacted the company s net sales  costs or business practices and management expects this to continue 
inflationary conditions in the united states and europe have been moderate and have not had a material impact on the results of operations or financial position for the three years ended june  despite higher inflationary rates in central america  inflation has not had a material impact on the results of operations of the company s units located in that region because the company has generally been able to pass on cost increases to its customers
