coinsured mortgages under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such case  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure 
for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage 
however  the general partner is not aware of any conditions or actions that would result in hud diminishing its insurance coverage 
as of december  and  the partnership  had invested in four and seven  respectively  fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages

patrician is litigating the case in bankruptcy court while negotiating a modification agreement with the borrower 
the general partner intends to continue to oversee the partnership s interest in these mortgages to ensure that patrician meets its coinsurance obligations 
the general partner s assessment of the realizability of the villas and st 
charles place phase ii mortgages is based on the most recent information available  and to the extent these conditions change or additional information becomes available  then the general partners assessment may change 
however  the general partner does not believe that there would be a material adverse impact on the partnership s financial condition or its results of operations should patrician be unable to comply with its full coinsurance obligation 
coinsured by affiliate as of december  and  the partnership held investments in two and five fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages  respectively  where the coinsurance lender is integrated funding  inc ifi  an affiliate of the partnership 
the partnership bears the risk of loss upon default for ifi s portion of the coinsurance loss 
the originated insured mortgages on carmen drive estates the forest  woodbine at lakewood apartments and woodland hills apartments were previously coinsured by m west mortgage corporation m west  a third party coinsurance lender 
during part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the fourth quarter of  the partnership was informed that m west was liquidating its assets and intended to assign the mortgage servicing rights related to these mortgages to another coinsurance lender  whitehall funding  inc whitehall 
the partnership successfully contested this transfer and obtained a court order mandating the transfer of the mortgage servicing rights related to these three coinsured loans to ifi 
this transfer was completed during the second quarter of this case is deemed settled and there will be no further litigation 
in november  the partnership received net proceeds of approximately million from the prepayment of the mortgage on woodbine at lakewood apartments  and recognized a gain of  for the year ended december  the net proceeds of per unit were distributed to unitholders in february in december  the partnership received net proceeds of approximately million and million from the prepayment of mortgages on pembrook apartments and carmen drive estates  respectively  and recognized gains of  and  respectively  for the year ended december  the net proceeds of per unit from pembrook apartments were distributed to unitholders in february the net proceeds of per unit from carmen drive estates are expected to be distributed to unitholders in may  since these proceeds were received in late december 
as of march   the two remaining ifi coinsured mortgages  as shown in the table below  were current with respect to the payment of principal and interest 
the mortgage on spring lake village which had been previously delinquent  was modified a second time as of february the interest rate on this mortgage was reduced to through december  increasing to for and for all subsequent years 
in addition  delinquent principal and interest payments from september  through december   have been deferred  with quarterly payments to be paid out of the mortgagors available cash flows 
no payments have been made on the deferred amount due to insufficient cash flows 
as of december    of this deferred amount is included in receivables and other assets 
the general partner believes there is adequate collateral value underlying these coinsured mortgages 
accordingly  no loan losses were recognized on these mortgages during the years ended december  and as of december  and december   these two and five investments had aggregate fair values of  and  respectively

all of the fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages contain such participations 
during the years ended december   and  the partnership received additional interest of   and  respectively  from the coinsured participations 
these amounts are included in mortgage investment income on the accompanying statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  were sufficient during to meet operating requirements 
the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages 
although insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base  resulting from monthly mortgage payments or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
if necessary  the partnership has the right to establish reserves either from the net proceeds of the offering or from cash flow as defined in the partnership agreement 
however  the partnership generally intends to distribute substantially all of its cash flow from operations 
if any reserves are deemed to be necessary by the partnership  they will be invested in short term  interest bearing investments 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to an increase in receivables and other assets resulting from increases in delinquent mortgage payments from the villas and st 
charles place phase ii mortgages 
in addition  mortgage investment income decreased  as discussed above 
this was offset by an increase in interest and other income and a decrease in general and administrative expenses  as discussed above 
net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to  primarily due to proceeds from the disposition of the mortgages on skyridge club  woodbine at lakewood apartments  pembrook apartments and carmen drive estates 
net cash used in financing activities increased for as compared to this increase was due to an increase in distributions to unitholders as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage on lakewood villas during the fourth quarter of the net disposition proceeds of approximately 
per unit were distributed to unitholders in may cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in receivables and other assets during as a result of the receipt in january of the remaining net disposition proceeds related to the disposition of the mortgage on victoria pointe apartments phase ii and receipt of accrued interest related to the mortgage on one east delaware 
net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to  primarily due to the investment in of approximately million in insured mortgages  which was partially offset by the receipt in of net disposition proceeds of approximately million from the disposition of the insured mortgage on one east delaware 
no insured mortgages were acquired during also contributing to the increase in net cash provided by investing activities  was the receipt in of net proceeds of approximately million related to the prepayment of the mortgage on lakewood villas during net cash used in financing activities decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to the distribution of accrued  but previously undistributed  interest from the disposition of the mortgage on one east delaware
