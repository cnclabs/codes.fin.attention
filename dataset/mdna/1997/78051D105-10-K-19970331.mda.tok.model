revenue gold sales the majority of the company s revenue is derived from gold sales 
revenue varies with the quantity of gold produced and the price received for that production 
the price of gold is affected by many factors which are beyond the company s control 
the company engages in hedging transactions which include spot deferred contracts  forward sales contracts  and options contracts to minimize the impact of fluctuations in the gold price 
in  revenue from gold sales of  ounces was million  an increase of from revenue of million in when gold sales were  ounces 
in  revenue was million from gold sales of  ounces 
production in included  ounces from the colomac mine which commenced operations in mid year 
because the mine had not reached commercial levels of production by the end of the year  revenue from this production was netted against start up costs and the excess was deferred as pre production costs 
hedging gains in contributed million of the total revenue of million 
in  hedging gains accounted for million of total revenue of million  and in hedging gains were million of the million in revenue

at december   the company had contractual arrangements to deliver  ounces of gold at prices of us to us per ounce from to the year the company has opted to deliver  ounces in which will realize an average price of approximately us per ounce of gold 
the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar during the past few years  has also contributed to increased revenues  except in when a stronger canadian dollar negatively impacted revenue 
the impact of increased production and of the change in gold price on revenue for the years through are set out in the table below 
millions impact on revenue due to increased production increased decreased prices incremental revenue from prior year in  an increase in the gold price of us per ounce would have increased revenue by approximately million 
interest and other income in  interest and other income decreased to million from million in but was higher than the million recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a breakdown and comparison of these amounts 
interest income in and reflected higher cash balances than in previous years due to equity issues and the exercise of warrants 
interest income in includes million of interest received on a refund of ontario mining taxes 
interest income of million was lower in than the million earned in mainly due to the cash outlay of million for the purchase of el condor resources ltd  st 
philips resources inc and consolidated professor mines limited early in the year 
the cash balance increased significantly again in august of when the company issued us million of senior subordinated notes due the company expects interest income to be approximately million in see special note regarding forward looking statements 
surplus cash is primarily invested in highly liquid  low risk financial instruments with relatively short maturities 
this strategy provides the company with maximum flexibility should funds be needed for acquisitions or other purposes 
in each of the years through  the company purchased shares in certain companies as part of its acquisition strategy to establish an equity position prior to holding discussions with management regarding a merger or takeover 
these positions were completely or partially sold when discussions and negotiations were terminated  resulting in gains on sales of securities 
the gain on sale of securities was million in compared to million in and million in other income in includes a million refund of ontario mining taxes previously paid 
interest and other income is expected to decline significantly in and for the next few years as the cash balance is used to fund the capital expenditure programs on the company s development and expansion projects 
costs and expenses operating in  operating costs of million were essentially the same as million in in  operating costs were million when gold production of  ounces was significantly lower than the  ounces produced in and  ounces produced in in  the inclusion of the colomac mine operating costs contributed approximately million to the increase from in  because the colomac mill had not reached commercial levels of production  start up costs net of revenue from gold sales were deferred to pre production costs 
operating costs are the cash costs incurred at the minesites and include the mining and processing costs associated with the production of gold 
the most significant of these costs are labor  consumable materials  fuel and utilities  and maintenance of machinery and equipment 
the costs of transporting personnel and freight to the colomac and hope brook mines are also significant costs for those operations 
in  average cash costs decreased by to us per ounce from us per ounce of gold in in  cash costs were us per ounce 
the increase in unit cash costs in aggregate from mainly reflects the impact of high fixed costs  increased electric power costs  declining ore grades  and lower productivity at certain mines 
the exception is at the pamour mine where unit cash costs decreased significantly in due to higher mill throughput and an increase in mill head grade resulting from processing higher grade ore from the nighthawk mine 
an analysis of costs on a mine by mine basis is presented in the review of operations of this annual report 
royalties and marketing royalties and marketing expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase mainly reflects increased gold production and gold price in the case of royalties 
in each year through  the hope brook mine paid an annual royalty of million 
this agreement expired in and no royalty will be payable on production from the hope brook mine in a royalty is payable on gold production from the nighthawk mine which commenced production in september administrative and corporate administrative and corporate expenses in increased by to million from million in  and were million in in both and  salary and benefit costs increased due to staff additions at the corporate office to manage the future growth of the company 
in  costs incurred during the relocation of the company s corporate office from vancouver  british columbia to kirkland  washington  amounted to million 
administrative and corporate expenses are expected to be approximately million annually over the next few years 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by in to million us per ounce of gold from million us per ounce in in  depreciation and amortization was million us per ounce 
increases in capital assets and deferred mining costs over the past several years at the colomac and nighthawk mines  combined with downward adjustments to mining reserves on specific properties  have led to these increases 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the unit of production method based upon the estimated gold contained in total mineral inventory 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
depreciation and amortization in is expected to be approximately million 
the decrease from reflects the write down in the carrying value of the colomac and hope brook assets 
reclamation management makes a provision for future reclamation costs on ultimate closure of a mine or abandonment of a property 
the reclamation provision in was million compared to million in and million in reclamation expenses at the minesites have become more significant to the company as it expands its operations and maintains compliance with more stringent environmental laws and regulations 
estimated reclamation and site restoration costs are charged against income on the unit of production method based upon the estimated gold contained in total mineral inventory 
exploration and other excluding exploration costs that were capitalized  exploration and other expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the company significantly increased its expenditures on exploration in in order to increase ore reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the company s accounting policy on exploration 
the company has budgeted approximately million annually on exploration over the next few years of which approximately million is expected to be expensed 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
foreign currency contracts the company enters into foreign currency contracts for protection from fluctuations in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate  and to provide a minimum canadian dollar conversion rate for its us dollar gold sales revenue 
these contracts are associated with the company s contractual obligation to deliver future gold production at specified prices in us dollars 
the status of these contracts is described in note b and c to the consolidated financial statements 
in and  the company made provisions for a recovery of million and million on foreign currency contracts  respectively  compared to a provision for a loss of million in interest expense in august  the company issued us million of senior subordinated notes due  the proceeds of which will be mainly used to finance construction of the kemess and other development projects

details of these charges are given in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in there was a write down of million 
income taxes the company paid minimal income taxes in  and the company has tax deductions  including earned depletion and mining exploration depletion  available to be utilized in future years amounting to million 
because of past reorganizations undertaken by the company  utilization of some of these tax deductions may be restricted 
the company does not expect to pay significant cash income taxes or mining taxes in canada for at least the next two years 
however  the company is subject to capital taxes and minimum taxes in certain canadian jurisdictions 
the company s us operations are taxable  however  the total of us taxes is not expected to be material 
the balance of the company s unrecognized deferred income tax assets is decreasing

cash flow sources of cash millions operating activities issue of shares issue of notes long term investments other total uses of cash millions acquisition of kemess acquisition of duport capital expenditures investments other total operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by to million in from million in  and was higher than million recorded in the combination of increased gold production and higher realized gold prices on revenue and operating income has had a positive impact on operating cash flow 
the provision for recovery of loss on foreign currency contracts was a significant non cash item in and  but was not significant in when the recovery reduced cash flow by million 
in there was a recovery of million which resulted in a reduction to cash flow compared to when there was a favourable contribution to cash flow of million 
in respect to non cash items  increases in depreciation in each of the last three years  and to a lesser extent increases in reclamation provisions  have had a positive impact on net cash provided by operating activities 
in  the closure costs and write down of resource properties and other assets of million for the hope brook and colomac mines had a significant positive impact on cash provided by operating activities 
net changes in other operating items of million in and million in were used in operating activities compared to a positive contribution of million in financing activities cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in compared to million in and million in in  the company issued equity and debt securities  principally to acquire and fund the development and construction of the kemess gold copper project 
the kemess mine is expected to be a major contributor to the company s growth in gold production and cash flow starting in the issue of common shares provided million in cash  of which the equivalent of million in royal oak shares was part payment for the purchase of el condor resources ltd 
the remainder being cash  and geddes resources limited

liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at year end  of which cash and equivalents and marketable securities amounted to million 
working capital was million at the end of  of which cash and equivalents and marketable securities amounted to million 
the increase mainly reflects the net result of additions of cash to the company s treasury provided by the debt and equity issues 
the total of cash and equivalents  and the commitment of funds from the british columbia provincial government for the kemess project  provide the company with a high degree of liquidity to meet the cash outflow needs of the capital spending program and other working capital needs of the company in the current ratio was at year end and at year end working capital is expected to decline in and as the company uses cash to fund construction of its development projects 
risks and uncertainties financial risks the company s profitability is primarily dependent on the quantity of gold produced at its operations  the selling price of gold  the canadian us dollar exchange rate  and the capital and operating costs to produce the gold 
the selling price of gold and the exchange rate are beyond management s control and are therefore considered to present the greatest risk to maintaining profitability 
the company employs hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of these two variables 
the credit risk related to hedging activities is limited to the unrealized gains on outstanding contracts based on current market prices 
the company believes it has minimized credit risk by dealing with large credit worthy institutions and by limiting credit exposure to each 
the company has consistently realized among the highest revenues per ounce of gold in the mining industry through successful hedging strategies which take advantage of the volatility in the spot gold price and the contango on future gold prices 
hedging gains are generated from spot deferred  forward sales and call option contracts which are employed to provide price protection while retaining the ability to benefit from higher gold prices 
the status of these contracts is described in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is confident that it will continue to realize a gold price significantly higher than the average spot price  although there can be no assurance that the premiums of us in  us in  and us per ounce in can be maintained 
the company has entered into oil swap agreements to hedge the cost of crude oil which is used to generate power at the colomac mine 
the cost of power is a significant component of total operating costs at colomac 
the status of these contracts is described in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the company sells its gold production in us dollars which are converted to canadian dollars  the currency in which the majority of the company s costs are incurred 
the company also reports its financial statements in canadian dollars 
from to  sales revenues have been beneficially impacted by a weakening canadian dollar 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as evidenced in when the canadian dollar strengthened slightly against the us dollar 
the company has us c foreign currency contracts in place  the status of which are described in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
operating and capital costs are subject to inflationary factors 
the financial statements of the company reflect historical costs  hence they do not show the cumulative effects of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar 
certain of the company s costs have increased because of inflation 
overall  costs may increase more or less than general inflation rates as a result of factors inherent in the mining industry and geographical location 
on the other hand  the selling price of gold is influenced primarily by international markets and other political  monetary and economic events and may not rise with inflation 
consequently  the company cannot counter rising costs of production by increasing selling prices  but must rely on controlling costs within its ability by continually searching for and implementing more cost efficient methods of mining and processing 
the ability to reduce unit cash costs is dependent on maintaining or increasing ore grades  production tonnages and productivity in order that the mines and mills can operate optimally 
in recent years the mill head grades have generally declined due to a number of factors including lower ore grades and mining dilution 
the company has implemented plans to restore mined ore grades to former levels  and in certain cases to increase mill feed grades by bringing nearby deposits containing higher grade ore into production 
reserve estimates may require revisions based on actual production experience 
the ore grade actually recovered may differ from the estimated grade of the reserves 
fluctuations in the gold price  as well as increased production costs or reduced recovery rates  may render reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to recover and may ultimately result in a restatement of reserves 
the company is continually seeking to replace and expand its reserves 
the company encounters competition from other mining companies  some with significantly greater financial resources than the company  in connection with the acquisition of properties 
in addition  there are a number of uncertainties inherent in any program relating to the location of economic ore reserves  the development of appropriate metallurgical processes  the receipt of necessary governmental permits and the construction of mining and processing facilities and the appropriate financing of exploration  development and operations 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company s exploration programs will result in the replacement of current production with new reserves or that development programs will be able to extend the life of existing mines 
the company takes a prudent approach to business and maintains adequate insurance at all times to cover normal business risks 
environmental risks the company s mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive federal  provincial  state and local laws and regulations governing exploration  development  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health and safety  waste disposal  monitoring  protection and remediation of the environment  reclamation  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases the costs of planning  designing  drilling  developing  constructing  operating and closing mines and other facilities 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with compliance with such laws and regulations could become such that the company would not proceed with the development or continue the operation of a mine or mines 
royal oak conducts its operations so as to protect its employees  the general public and the environment and believes its operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  in all material respects 
the company is not able to determine the impact of future changes in environmental laws and regulations  which are generally becoming more restrictive  on its operations and future financial position due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate form such changes may take 
insurance against certain liabilities for environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to companies in the mining industry 
without such insurance  if the company becomes subject to environmental liabilities  the payment of such liabilities would reduce its available funds 
the company believes that it has made adequate financial provisions for the costs associated with mine closures and reclamation  and is of the opinion that any changes to environmental laws and regulations in the future should not have a material effect on the company 
political and other risks all of the company s mining operations are located in canada and as such the company is not exposed to the political and economic risks associated with operating in foreign countries 
the company has an exploration and development project copperstone in the united states 
the company s interest in gold in china is through asia minerals corp  a owned canadian affiliated company 
the company believes that the risks and uncertainties of operating and investing in these countries are manageable and reasonable relative to the expected benefits 
because the company s new development projects are located in remote areas of canada and the united states  the company is exposed to intervening parties such as first nations groups and various cottage residents 
in order to minimize any potential risk to a project  the company does not proceed with development until all permits and licenses have been received 
the company works with special interest groups to understand their needs and provides contract and employment opportunities to these groups 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
the outlook for royal oak over the next few years is most encouraging as the company develops a number of major capital projects that are expected to increase gold production to approximately one million ounces by the year  and at the same time reduce cash costs significantly 
this will achieve a major strategic objective set by management three years ago 
each year since the acquisition of the pamour and giant yellowknife groups in november  the company has increased its gold production  mineral inventory  revenue  shareholders equity and total assets through a number of acquisitions 
this growth has been reflected in the market capitalization of the company which has increased significantly  from million at the end of to million at the end of the company s growth has been funded by issuing new equity and debt while the company has maintained a strong balance sheet 
this increase in market capitalization has been accompanied by a increase in the number of common shares outstanding 
the company recognizes that further dilution of shareholders equity is not desirable and has no plans to issue more equity to fund the development and construction of its capital projects 
approximately million net to royal oak will be required to fund these projects over the next four years and will be sourced from cash in treasury  operating cash flow and economic assistance and compensation from the b 
c 
government 
in  the company increased its cash position by issuing debt securities to complete the funding of the kemess project 
at year end  the debt to total capitalization ratio was 
the company will maintain appropriate liquidity and a prudent level of debt as it funds its aggressive growth 
royal oak s gold production has increased since primarily through the acquisitions of the hope brook mine and the colomac mine 
gold production is scheduled to decrease slightly from  ounces in to approximately  ounces in due to closure of the hope brook mine in september of gold production in is estimated at approximately  ounces  and  ounces in increases in production will come from kemess  matachewan  the pamour expansion and a number of other smaller projects currently under development over the next four years 
royal oak begins with million ounces of gold in mineable ore reserves 
the company plans to maintain an active exploration program on its properties to increase ore reserves with expected expenditures of approximately million per year 
royal oak expects increased earnings and cash flow for shareholders as lower cost gold production and ore reserves increase in the years ahead
