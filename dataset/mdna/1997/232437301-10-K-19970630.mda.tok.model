item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this report on form k contains forward looking statements regarding the future performance of cyanotech and future events that involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements contained herein 
this document  and the other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  such as our reports on form k  form q  form k  and our proxy materials  contain additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ from our current expectations and the forward looking statements contained herein 
all references to years in this item are to fiscal years 
during  substantially all of our resources were dedicated to the production of spirulina pacifica  a nutritional microalgae 
we sell spirulina pacifica to health food manufacturers  health food distributors and retail consumers on a worldwide basis 
through the application of our integrated culture biology management icbm technology  we maintain continuous algae cultures and produce a new crop from each of our algal culture ponds aggregating approximately acres approximately every week  on average 
historically  the majority of our net sales have been derived from sales of bulk spirulina pacifica products  which have lower associated gross profit measured in dollars but higher associated gross margin measured as a percentage of net sales than our packaged consumer products 
accordingly  an increase in the percentage of net sales attributable to bulk products would increase gross margin 
conversely  an increase in the percentage of net sales attributable to packaged consumer products would decrease gross margin but likely increase gross profit 
we expect that the product mix will vary from period to period  and a decrease in orders from a customer such as our largest current customer which purchases primarily packaged consumer products could require us to reallocate greater portions of our production capacity to lower gross profit bulk products 
during the second half of  we began limited commercial production of our natural astaxanthin product  naturose  and commenced full commercial production in march  also in march  we announced that we had received approval from the state of hawaii to lease an additional acres for the purpose of expanding naturose production capacity 
expansion onto the acres is currently planned to be accomplished in three increments  the first increment is planned to include acres of culture systems  together with harvesting and processing equipment sufficient to accommodate the entire site 
completion of the first phase is planned for june since  we have experienced substantial growth in our revenues and operations  and have undergone substantial changes in our business that have placed significant demands on the management  working capital and financial and management control systems of cyanotech 
our current and future expansion plans may also place a significant strain on the management  working capital and financial control systems of cyanotech 
although we believe that our systems and controls are adequate to address our current needs  there can be no assurance that such systems will be adequate to address our future business expansion plans 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if revenues do not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in operating expenses resulting from any expansion and there can be no assurance that any expansion will be profitable or that it will not adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  the success of any current or future expansion plans will depend in part upon our ability to continue to improve and expand our management and financial control systems  to attract  retain and motivate key personnel  and to raise additional required capital 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such respects 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of income data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development general and administrative sales and marketing total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income  net total other income expense net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for the year ended march  were  a increase over net sales of  for the year ended march  the increase in net sales during the year ended march  is attributable to significantly higher production and sales of bulk spirulina powder and tablets and increased sales of packaged consumer products which carry a higher sales price than bulk spirulina pacifica products 
the increased production is the result of spirulina production expansions that were completed in february and november international sales represented and of total net sales for the years ended march  and  respectively 
this increase reflects the company s continuing emphasis on developing international markets and higher sales of packaged consumer products into asian retail markets 
the company s largest customer  a hong kong based natural products marketing and distribution company  accounted for approximately and of cyanotech s net sales in the years ended march  and  respectively

proportionate share of loss of joint venture proportionate share of loss of joint venture represents the company s ownership interest in a joint venture with aquasearch  inc for the development of astaxanthin 
the loss in the year ended march  represents services  and facilities and equipment use that was contributed to the joint venture by cyanotech 
the joint venture was terminated in november by mutual consent and the company has no further obligation under the joint venture arrangement 
net income net income increased to  or of net sales  for the year ended march   from  or of net sales  for the year ended march  the increase in net income was primarily a result of increased production and sales of bulk and packaged consumer spirulina pacifica products 
inflation during the years ended march   and did not have a material impact on the company s operations 
variability of results cyanotech corporation was formed in and did not become profitable on an annual basis until fiscal the twelve month period ended december  
as of march   our accumulated deficit was  there can be no assurance that we will be consistently profitable on either a quarterly or an annual basis 
we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations may continue in future periods 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales levels to our largest customers  new product introductions  weather patterns  the mix between sales of bulk products and packaged consumer products  start up costs associated with new facilities  expansion into new markets  sales promotions  competition  increased energy costs  the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors  changes in our customer mix  and overall trends in the market for spirulina products 
while a significant portion of our expense levels are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on our forecasts of future sales  if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
we may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
new accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no

if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of that loss would be based on the fair value of the asset 
generally  sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell

liquidity and capital resources cyanotech s cash and investment securities decreased  to  during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease is primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures for equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash flows provided by operating activities were  in compared to  in the primary source of cash flows from operating activities was net income and an increase in accounts payable offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accrued expenses and other 
cash flows used in investing activities were  in compared to  in the primary uses of cash flows in investing activities during were for capital expenditures and net purchases of investment securities 
cash flows provided by financing activities were  in compared to  in the primary sources of cash flows provided by financing activities were  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock to the underwriters of a public stock offering and  from the exercise of common stock options and warrants  offset by principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
as of march   we had construction commitments totaling  which we intend to fund from cash reserves and anticipated cash flows from future operations 
we presently estimate that our existing capital resources and anticipated cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to fund current operations 
however  we plan to spend  subject to available financing  approximately million on capital expenditures during the next two fiscal years  primarily to expand naturose production on the newly leased acres and existing capital resources and anticipated cash flows from future operations will not be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures 
we are currently seeking an increase in our credit facilities to meet any anticipated shortfall 
we currently have a  bank line of credit which is collateralized by a certificate of deposit and an additional  bank line of credit which is collateralized by all the assets of the company 
as of march   there were no borrowings under either of these credit lines
