exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls the vast majority of the company s contracts are entered into by the company s united states or united kingdom subsidiaries 
the contracts entered into by the united states subsidiaries are almost always denominated in united states dollars 
contracts between the company s united kingdom subsidiaries and their clients are generally denominated in pounds sterling 
because substantially all of the united kingdom subsidiaries expenses  such as salaries  services  materials and supplies  are paid in pounds sterling  such subsidiaries earnings are not materially affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
however  the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results  and also affect the dollar amounts actually received by the company from such subsidiaries 
approximately of the company s net revenue was generated by its european  south african and south american clinical development services businesses  primarily in the united kingdom  belgium  france and germany 
as a result of the company s sale of its toxicology operations  the percentage of the company s revenue recorded in currencies other than united states dollars was significantly lower in than in however  because the company is currently expanding its foreign operations  it is anticipated that the percentage of the company s net revenue denominated in foreign currencies may increase in the future 
there are no exchange controls currently in effect in any country in which the company s subsidiaries conduct operations on the payment of dividends or otherwise restricting the transfer of funds outside such countries by a company resident in such countries 
although the company performs services for clients located in a number of foreign jurisdictions  to date  the company has not experienced any difficulties in receiving funds remitted from foreign countries 
however  if any such jurisdictions were to impose or modify existing exchange control restrictions on the remittance of funds to the company  such restrictions could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price the company s quarterly operating results are subject to volatility due to such factors as the commencement  completion or cancellation of large contracts  progress of ongoing contracts  acquisitions  the timing of start up expenses for new offices  management of growth and changes in the mix of services 
since a large percentage of the company s operating costs are relatively fixed  variations in the timing and progress of large contracts can materially affect quarterly results 
to the extent the company s international business increases  exchange rate fluctuations may also influence these results 
the company believes that comparisons of its quarterly financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
however  fluctuations in quarterly results or other factors beyond the company s control  such as changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in the cro  environmental  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and general economic conditions  could affect the market price of the common stock in a manner unrelated to the longer term operating performance of the company
