results of operations the following table sets forth the company s net sales by product line for each of the years in the three year period ended june  fiscal year ended in thousands june  june  july  defense electronics    satellite communications    wireless   new sales historically associated with particular product lines may not be indicative of future trends because of the relative size of individual orders and changes in the company s emphasis on specific product lines 
see business company products and business backlog 
to better serve its emerging commercial markets  the company reorganized  during the first quarter of fiscal into three internal business groups 
these business groups are defense electronics formerly electronic warfare  satellite communications formerly radar and telecommunications and wireless 
products in the defense electronics business unit consist of the company s line of military products  which include digital frequency discriminators dfd s  digital rf memories drfm s  esm receivers and military microwave integrated circuit components mic s 
satellite communications products consist of signal distribution networks for phase array antennas and customized commercial multilayer components such as butler matrices and beamforming networks for commercial telecommunication satellites 
wireless products are microwave components and assemblies for use in building wireless base station equipment 
these products are a forward evolution of the military microwave components and are significantly smaller and lighter  while providing better performance 
each business group is composed of an independent engineering and marketing sales team whose purpose is to develop  market and deliver product to its customers 
this action was taken to optimize responsiveness to customer needs and to provide extended fiscal accountability downward throughout the organization 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results of operations for fiscal were highlighted by significant increases in sales of the company s commercial products and the highest net earnings and backlog achieved by the company in the past ten years 
net sales for fiscal were  up from fiscal net sales of  and the company recorded net earnings of  compared to a loss of  for the prior year 
during fiscal  sales in both the company s commercial satellite communications group and wireless group increased substantially over the prior year s levels  while during this same period  sales of the defense electronics group continued the decline seen over the past five years 
sales of wireless products  which are mainly surface mount and custom components for use in building cellular base station equipment  increased  in fiscal  a rise over sales of  in fiscal the rise in sales in this product group is currently being fueled by significant increases in shipments of custom base station components being built for lucent technologies  inc  motorola  inc 
and nortel  inc 
under a number of continuing contracts with a projected current annual shipment value of over  shipments under these contracts totaled over  in fiscal  compared to less than  in the previous fiscal year 
additionally  shipments of off the shelf surface mount catalog components  which are used mainly in the construction of cellular base station amplifiers  rose in fiscal compared to fiscal  as amplifier manufacturers demands continue to increase for these products 
new orders for wireless products totaled approximately  during fiscal  resulting in a firm backlog of  at june   all of which is expected to ship in the first quarter of fiscal it is typical procedure for the company s large base station manufacturing customers to negotiate an annual blanket contract for price and delivery using an estimated expected annual demand for a particular product 
these manufacturers then provide the company with a firm purchase order for the products required on a quarterly  monthly or weekly basis 
it has been the company s internal policy to only book orders for the wireless group upon receipt of these short term firm purchase orders 
in july  the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded firm orders for the wireless group totaling over  all of which is scheduled to ship in the first half of fiscal sales of satellite communications products  which consist of custom multi layer components such as butler matrices and beamforming networks for commercial telecommunications and military communications satellites  rose  or in fiscal compared to fiscal this substantial rise in shipments is attributed to sales of over  for contract engineering design work on two beamformers for commercial satellite applications for space systems loral  inc and martin marietta overseas corp 
sales in fiscal included approximately  in billings for initial design work on these two programs 
of the remaining  shipped by this group in fiscal  approximately  represented production under the final phase of the  iridium program and spares production for the ground based radar military program  both of which are being built for raytheon company 
these two programs amounted to over  in sales in fiscal new orders for the satellite communications group amounted to  in fiscal compared to  in the previous fiscal year 
the two largest of these orders were a firm fixed price contract for over  from martin marietta overseas corp 
for the design and production of antenna beamforming networks for the asia cellular satellite system aces and a  contract from hughes space and communications international  inc for the manufacture of microwave signal distribution networks for the ico system 
the aces system is a space based cellular communications system  to serve asia via two geosynchronous satellites  while the hughes ico program is a medium earth orbit constellation of satellites to provide world wide cellular telephone service starting in firm backlog for this group was  at june   up over firm backlog of  at june  of this amount  approximately  is expected to ship in fiscal and the remainder in fiscal sales of defense electronics products fell  to  in fiscal compared to  in the previous year 
shipments in this business area  which include digital frequency discriminators dfd s  digital rf memories drfm s  esm receivers and microwave integrated circuit components mic s  have been declining over the past three years due to the continuing decline in the overall worldwide defense market 
the drop in sales in fiscal was spread over all the above mentioned product areas in the defense electronics group and was a result of the completion of one of the company s remaining large dfd programs in fiscal and a general decline in demand for off the shelf catalog military mic s during the last quarter of fiscal and continuing in fiscal new orders for defense electronics products totaled approximately  in fiscal and firm backlog for this product area was  at june  of this backlog amount   represented two orders from the aspj joint venture team of itt avionics division of itt industries and northrop grumman corp 
for foreign sales of the airborne self protection jammer system 
these orders should serve to help stabilize sales in this business area when shipments begin in the first quarter of fiscal approximately  of the firm backlog of  at june  is expected to ship in fiscal and the remainder in fiscal net earnings for fiscal were  compared to a net loss of  for fiscal the net loss for the prior year included a one time charge totaling  to recognize the cost of the divestiture of the company s electronic warfare simulator manufacturing operation in england 
this improvement in earnings was a result of the rise in revenues and was achieved despite a two percentage point decline in gross margins and small increase in both marketing and general and administrative costs 
gross margin on sales for fiscal was compared to for fiscal this decline was a direct result of lower margins on initial product runs of wireless custom components during the period due to excess scrap costs and rework costs incurred in repairing production units above normal experience levels in fiscal the company expects that gross margins will improve in fiscal with higher production rates and increased experience with high volume production products 
research and development expense was  for fiscal  down  from  for fiscal this decline resulted from a significant increase in customer funded engineering design work in both the defense electronics and satellite communications groups during the period which consumed all available engineering resources in these groups 
customer funded design and development work in fiscal represented approximately  in sales  a three fold increase over engineering revenues of  in fiscal additionally  the company is currently participating in a technology reinvestment program through raytheon company  for the advanced research project agency of the united states government 
under this project  the company was reimbursed for approximately  of research and development costs incurred during fiscal for investigating the development of manufacturing processes for thin  multilayer millimeter wave signal distribution networks 
this program is expected to run through all of fiscal at the rate of approximately  per quarter 
current internal research and development efforts are being targeted on adapting existing company technologies to produce new satellite and wireless products which fit specific customers requirements 
future research and development expenditures are expected to rise with increasing sales volume and to fluctuate based on identified market opportunities  customer funding for custom engineering development projects and the level of government supported research development projects 
marketing expense rose in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was caused mainly by additions to marketing personnel in europe to better serve the company s emerging commercial markets in that part of the world  a rise in commission expense due to the a increase in sales and a increase in advertising expenditures targeted mainly for the company s wide variety of new commercial wireless products 
marketing expense is expected to rise in fiscal as the company intends to expand its sales force and advertising program to further penetrate the wireless base station equipment market 
general and administrative expense rose  or  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
approximately half of this increase was attributable to normal increases in payroll costs for existing personnel  while the remaining increase represents a small increase in personnel  as well as minor increases in professional services and shareholders expense 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase modestly in fiscal as the general level of company business continues to rise 
interest expense fell in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in interest expense reflects the continuing reduction in long term debt over the past year 
during this same period  other income was down due to lower investable cash balances during the current year compared to the previous fiscal year 
consolidated income tax expense was in fiscal versus an expected tax expense of approximately  based on of income before income taxes 
the difference between the actual tax expense recognized in the financial statements and the expected tax calculated on net income was due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and to a decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
under tax accounting rules the company must assess the realizability of deferred tax assets  considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management of the company has considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making the assessment of the realizability of the deferred tax asset balances at june  based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  the company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances  at june  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement  beginning with the company s first quarter of fiscal upon adoption of statement  the company continued to measure compensation expense for its stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and has provided pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method prescribed by statement has been applied in measuring compensation expense 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results of operations for fiscal showed a loss of slightly less than million resulting from poor sales performance by the company s english subsidiary and the decision by the company to close this european repair facility at anaren microwave  ltd 
and liquidate its electronic warfare ew simulator manufacturing operation headquartered there 
net sales for fiscal were  down from fiscal sales levels  while the net loss for fiscal was  compared to a net loss of  for the prior year 
included in the fiscal loss was an  third quarter restructuring charge against earnings related to the divestiture of the company s ew simulator manufacturing operation in the united kingdom 
during the year ended june   sales in the satellite communications group rose  or over fiscal levels  while shipments for the company s new wireless group rose  to  compared to only  in fiscal during this same period sales of defense electronics products fell approximately  compared to the previous fiscal year  resulting in an overall sales decline of  in fiscal sales of satellite communications products  which consist of customized commercial multilayer components such as butler matrices and beamforming networks for commercial satellites  increased  to  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal this increase is attributable to over  in shipments in fiscal under the army ground based radar program gbr and over  in shipments of satellite beamforming networks under a  production contract with raytheon company for the iridium project 
these two programs accounted for approximately  in shipments in fiscal new orders for satellite communications products total  during fiscal and included initial engineering funding for development of antenna beamforming networks for satellite telecommunications systems being developed by trw  inc  martin marietta overseas corp 
and space systems loral  inc 
at june  firm backlog for satellite communications products was  sales of wireless products  which consist of components for use in building cellular base station equipment  rose from  in fiscal to almost  in fiscal these sales consisted mainly of catalog microwave components and pilot production runs of custom components for base station equipment manufacturers 
the wireless business unit received significant initial production orders totaling over  from nortel  inc and motorola  inc 
during fiscal for custom base station components 
these orders began initial low level production runs in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and reached full production at the end of the second quarter of fiscal firm backlog for wireless products was approximately  at june  sales of defense electronics products fell  to  in fiscal  compared to sales of approximately  in fiscal shipments in this business area  which include digital frequency discriminators dfd s  digital rf memories drfm s  esm receivers  military simulators and microwave integrated circuit components mic s have been steadily declining over the past three fiscal years due to the decline in the overall worldwide defense market 
the drop in sales in fiscal was spread over all of the above mentioned product areas  except for mic s and drfm s due to the completion of a number of large dfd programs in the latter part of fiscal and early fiscal  and a drop off in new orders for esm receivers in fiscal during fiscal  the company received a number of new orders in the defense electronics business area totaling over  the most significant of these was from the aspj joint venture team of itt avionics division of itt industries and northrop grumman corp 
for foreign sales of the airborne self protection jammer 
firm backlog in this product area at june  was  during  the company booked new orders totaling approximately  compared to new orders of approximately  for all of fiscal firm backlog for all business lines as of june  stood at  a increase over firm backlog of  at the end of fiscal the loss for fiscal was  compared to a loss of  for fiscal the fiscal year loss consisted of a  operating loss caused by the low level of sales and margins at the company s european subsidiary and an  non recurring restructuring charge against earnings recorded in the third quarter required to recognize the divestiture of the company s electronic warfare ew simulator manufacturing operation in the united kingdom 
this restructuring charge  which included provisions for the write down of ew simulator assets to realizable value  legal and professional fees and costs to complete an existing ew simulator contract in excess of expected revenue  reduced earnings for both the three months ended march  and the year end june  these actions were necessitated by the severe down sizing of the military budgets in europe which resulted in a substantial reduction in new orders for ew simulators during the past two years and has resulted in ongoing losses from operations at anaren microwave  ltd 
including a  operating loss for fiscal this divestiture allowed the company to focus its efforts on its growing domestic operations 
gross margin on sales for fiscal was compared to in fiscal this substantial improvement was the result of higher sales volume at the company s us manufacturing facility which allowed for better absorption of fixed overhead costs and personnel reductions made in the second quarter of fiscal which were specifically targeted at reducing manufacturing overhead and engineering costs 
additionally  during fiscal  approximately  of costs incurred in building products for shipment during this period were charged against the allowance for contract losses established in fiscal and these expenses represent cost overruns incurred on products shipped in the first three quarters of fiscal which had previously been identified and provided for when the allowance was established 
research and development expense was  for fiscal  up from  for the same period in fiscal this increase represented the continuing rise in the prototype development efforts for the company s new wireless commercial product line 
development efforts were being targeted on adapting existing company technologies to produce new wireless component products which fit a specific customer s requirements 
marketing expense fell in fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was due mainly to the reassignment of marketing personnel to other functions within the company due to the business group realignment undertaken in the first quarter of the current year 
general and administrative expenses rose in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase represented normal period to period fluctuation in expenditures 
fiscal levels of general and administrative spending reflect the same level or lower of that experienced by the company in fiscal interest expense fell in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal the decline in interest expense reflects the reduction in long term debt over the year 
during this same period  other income fell due to lower investable cash balances during fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated income tax expense was in fiscal versus an expected tax benefit of approximately  based on of the loss before income taxes 
the primary difference between the actual tax expense recognized in the financial statements and the expected tax benefit calculated on the loss incurred was due to the company s equity in the operating loss of its english subsidiary which is not subject to us taxation and offset by a decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
under the new tax accounting rules the company must assess the realizability of deferred tax assets  considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management of the company has considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making the assessment of the realizability of the deferred tax asset balances at june  liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had net working capital of  which included  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to working capital of  which included cash and cash equivalents of  at june  net cash surplus was  for fiscal compared to a net cash usage of  in fiscal cash flow was positive in fiscal due to the growth in earnings and accounts payable  the receipt of a  tax refund from the us government and an increase in advance payments from customers of over  during the period 
long term liabilities  which consist of the company s unfunded liability for post retirement health care costs  long term debt in the form of a term loan and deferred income taxes  decreased  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in both fiscal years and represents scheduled repayment of debt as the company  presently  has no plans to fund the long term liability recognized for post retirement healthcare costs 
no new long term debt  other than the transfer of its term loan to its new bank  was taken on during this two year period as the company s cash balances were more than adequate to fund both long and short term cash needs 
capital equipment additions in fiscal amounted to  and consisted primarily of equipment needed to further automate production for the company s new wireless and satellite communications products as well as test and production equipment required to produce defense electronics products for the initial production of the aspj program in the first quarter of fiscal the additions were funded entirely by cash generated by operations 
capital equipment expenditures for fiscal have been budgeted at approximately  and will consist  primarily  of additional automated high volume production equipment to further expand production capacity for the new wireless products 
these additions will continue to be funded by cash generated from operations and currently existing cash balances as management believes that these cash resources will be adequate to meet these financing needs 
in fiscal  the company obtained a revolving line of credit with a bank which provided for principal drawings of up to  this credit agreement carried interest on outstanding borrowings at the prime rate plus and was secured by all assets of the company which were not otherwise pledged under other agreements 
this credit facility expired at december  in october  the company signed an agreement for a new credit facility with a bank providing for a  working capital revolving line of credit bearing interest at prime plus maturing on november   and a  term loan payable in semi annual installments of  through may   bearing interest at prime plus 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to refinance the existing onondaga county industrial development agency revenue bonds of the company  while the revolving credit facility will be used to supplement short term working capital needs brought about by the expected growth in production and sales volumes 
borrowings under the new credit facility are secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
the terms of the credit facility require the company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth  ratio of cash flows to maturities  and leverage ratio  as defined in the respective agreements 
the company was in compliance with all restrictions and covenants at june  the company believes that its cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be satisfied by currently invested cash balances  expected cash flow from operations and funds available under its credit facilities
