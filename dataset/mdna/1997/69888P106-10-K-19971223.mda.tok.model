item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements in this form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including those concerning management s expectations with respect to future financial performance and future events  particularly relating to sales of current products as well as the introduction of new manufactured and distributed products 
such statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of the company  which could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those expressed herein 
factors that might affect such forward looking statements set forth in this form k include  among others  i increased competition from new and existing competitors and pricing practices from such competitors  ii pricing pressures resulting from the continued consolidation by the company s distribution channels  iii the amount of funds continuing to be available for internal research and development and research and development joint ventures  iv research and development project delays or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  v the ability of the company to retain and attract management personnel in key operational areas and vi continued availability of borrowings under the company s credit line without significant reduction 
results of operations general the company incurred an operating loss of  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  and  for the fiscal year ended september  the losses were principally due to sales and gross margin declines  as described below  partially offset by decreases in operating expenses in fiscal year and the latter part of fiscal year the company s gross margin decline to  for the current fiscal year from  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  was attributable to the continuing trend of lower pricing on certain manufactured products 
the trend was partially offset in the last two months of fiscal year by increased sales and margins generated from certain distributed products under the supply agreement with basf described above 
if sales declines of certain manufactured products are not offset by increased sales of new distributed or manufactured products  lower net sales and gross margins will continue and  accordingly  result in further losses 
as a result of the recent losses  the company is continuing to search for strategic alternatives to strengthen its financial condition and product line while working on process improvements to reduce its current manufacturing costs 
for the three month period ended september   the company s operating loss of  decreased from  for the three month period ended september  the improvement was primarily related to increased sales and margins generated from certain products as a result of the supply agreement with basf and cost reductions and process improvements implemented throughout the year 
the continued price and profit margin erosion on certain of the company s products reflects a continuing trend in the generic drug industry in the united states 
the factors contributing to the intense competition and affecting both the introduction of new products and the pricing and profit margins of the company  include  among other things  i introduction of other generic drug manufacturer s products in direct competition with the company s significant products  ii consolidation among distribution outlets  iii increased ability of generic competitors to enter the market after patent expiration  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits  iv willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among pharmaceutical manufacturers  and v competition from brand name drug manufacturers selling generic versions of their drugs 
in response to these conditions  the company has continued to reduce operating costs and entered into several significant agreements  as described elsewhere in this form k  which should enable the company to better compete in the current environment see business marketing and customers and competition 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company began implementing cost reduction measures which continued throughout fiscal year such measures have provided for a reduction in the work force  changes in senior management  a reorganization of certain existing personnel  reductions in certain operating expenses and the implementation of several process improvements see notes to financial statements commitments  contingencies and other matters restructuring and cost reductions 
these measures have reduced certain operating costs in fiscal year no assurances can be given that reduced costs will return the company to profitability 
critical to significant improvement in the company s financial condition is the introduction and acquisition of new manufactured and distributed products at profitable prices 
the company plans to continue to invest in research and development efforts in addition to pursuing additional products for sale through new and existing distribution agreements 
there were no significant sales of any new manufactured or distributed products  other than those sold under the supply agreement with basf  introduced during the current fiscal year 
the company is engaged in efforts  subject to fda approval and other factors  to introduce new products as a result of its research and development efforts and distribution agreements 
no assurance can be given that any additional products for sale by the company will occur or that sales of additional products will reduce losses or return the company to profitability 
continuing losses will adversely affect the company s liquidity and  accordingly  its ability to fund research and development or ventures relating to the sale of new products see financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
sales net sales of  for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  or  from sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the decline was due principally to decreased sales of manufactured products which resulted primarily from lower pricing and continuing decreases in volume of one of the company s significant products  and to a lesser extent  two other significant products  partially offset by higher volumes of a lower margin product due to increased demand from one customer 
the reductions in pricing and volume resulted from increased competition from other drug manufacturers 
net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of two distributed products manufactured by basf under the supply agreement experienced significant increases over the same period of the prior year helping to offset the decline in sales of certain manufactured products in the current fiscal year 
sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year of  increased  or  from  for the fourth quarter of fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher volumes of a lower margin manufactured product and two products manufactured by basf 
the increase was partially offset by the continuing lower sales of certain of the company s significant products as previously discussed 
net sales of  for the year ended september  decreased  or  from  for the year ended september  the decline primarily resulted from decreased sales of manufactured product due to lower pricing and decreases in volume of one of the company s significant products  and to a lesser extent  two other significant products  which was caused principally by the introduction of competitive products by other drug manufacturers 
the decline in sales of manufactured products was partially offset by higher volumes of a lower margin distributed product 
levels of sales are principally dependent upon  among other things  i pricing levels and competition  ii market penetration for the existing product line  iii approval of andas and introduction of new manufactured products  iv introduction of new distributed products and v the level of customer service see business competition 
gross margins the company s gross margin for the year ended september  was  of net sales compared to  of net sales for the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin decline is primarily due to continued lower selling prices and decreased volumes of certain significant manufactured products resulting from the introduction of other generic drug manufacturers products in direct competition with the company s significant products 
the gross margin on distributed products for the current year increased primarily due to the contribution from the additional sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of products manufactured by basf  however  the effect on the total margin for the year was negligible 
the gross margin for the three month period ended september  increased  to  of net sales from  of net sales recorded in the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in margin is primarily due to the increased volumes of a lower margin manufactured product together with more favorable raw material pricing  and the contribution from additional sales of distributed product manufactured by basf 
in addition  an inventory adjustment was recorded in the corresponding quarter of last year which lowered the cost of one of the company s manufactured products to its market value  adversely affecting the margin in that period 
lower sales in the current three month period of certain significant manufactured products  as discussed above  partially offset the increases in margin 
inventory write offs  taken in the normal course of business  amounted to   and  for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively  and   and  for the fourth quarters of fiscal years  and  respectively 
the inventory write offs are related principally to the disposal of finished products due to short shelf life 
during fiscal year  four of the company s products accounted for approximately of its net sales compared to and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal and one of such products contributed significantly to the sales and gross margin in all three periods 
a competitor of the company received fda approval for this product in fiscal year where  prior to that time  the company had been the sole generic manufacturer 
as a result of the increased competition  net sales of that product decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year with decreases in gross margin 
during the second half of calendar  two generic pharmaceutical manufacturers received fda approval for a product which the company had also been the sole generic manufacturer 
as a result of the increased competition on that product  net sales decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year with decreases in gross margin 
these products  along with one other product  had historically accounted for a significant percentage of the company s net sales and gross margin 
due to the increased competition with respect to these products  the company s sales and gross margins have been materially and adversely affected 
during the current fiscal year  the company has implemented measures to lessen the overall impact of these products by increasing margins on higher volume products through the supply agreement with basf  manufacturing process improvements and cost reductions 
there can be no assurances that these measures will return the company to profitability 
gross margin of  of net sales in fiscal year decreased  from  of net sales in fiscal year primarily due to lower selling prices and decreased volumes of certain significant manufactured products resulting from the introduction of other generic drug manufacturers products in direct competition with the company s significant products 
gross margins on distributed products decreased principally due to lower sales levels of higher margin products and increased sales of a lower margin product
