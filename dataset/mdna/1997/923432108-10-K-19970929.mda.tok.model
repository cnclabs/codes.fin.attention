sales to the company s top five customers accounted for  and of sales in   and  respectively 
the company s largest customers include nortel  inc  mci communications corp  compuserve corp  and qualcomm incorporated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and factors affecting future results customer concentration 
the company sells its products primarily in the united states to nsps through a direct sales force and through a variety of resellers  including original equipment manufacturers oems  value added resellers vars and distributors 
sales to vars and distributors accounted for approximately of sales in as compared to approximately in  and in to date  international sales have not been significant 
the company intends to expand the marketing of its products generally and particularly to markets outside the united states 
gross profit thousands gross profit    percentage of sales gross profit as a percentage of sales in was as compared to in the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily the result of higher fixed overhead costs associated with the addition of a new manufacturing facility in  and lower sales volume in the second half of the year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in increased to from in due to manufacturing efficiencies attributable to higher volume production and lower component costs 
in future periods  the company s gross profit will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the channels of distribution  the price of products sold  discounting practices  the mix of products sold  price competition  increases in material costs  and changes in other components of cost of sales 
as the company introduces new products  it is possible that such products may have lower gross profit than other established products in high volume production 
accordingly  gross profit as a percentage of sales may vary 
research and development thousands research and development    percentage of sales research and development expenses increased to million or of sales in  compared to million and million or and of sales for and  respectively 
the expense increase was due principally to the addition of personnel  use of outside consultants  depreciation of capital expenditures and prototype development  design  and testing 
the company considers product development expenditures to be critical to future sales and expects to increase spending in absolute dollars  while such expenditures as a percentage of sales may vary 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors as noted below 
selling  general and administrative thousands selling  general  and administrative    percentage of sales the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in dollars spent was due to the addition of personnel  the expansion of domestic sales offices  and incentive compensation  including commissions associated with sales growth 
these expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in primarily due to increased sales 
the company expects to increase sales and marketing spending in fiscal as a part of its effort to increase international sales and expand the markets for its products

the effective tax rate of approximates the combined federal and state statutory rates 
the effective tax rate in was less than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of previously reserved deferred tax assets based on carryback capacity and  to a lesser extent  expectations of future income in the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal represented minimum state income and franchise taxes 
liquidity and capital resources on june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included million of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
the company had a secured million revolving line of credit which expired on august  there was no borrowing under the line of credit in the company is currently investigating the possibility of establishing a new unsecured credit facility on more favorable terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish such facility on more favorable terms  or at all 
during  the company generated million of net cash from operating activities  a increase over the million generated in during  net cash used in operating activities was million  primarily due to the payment of accrued compensation expense 
accounts receivable remained constant in as compared to at million while increasing from levels of million 
inventory levels declined  from reflecting the shipment of product that had accumulated in anticipation of higher sales in early accounts payable decreased by  in reflecting lower year end volume with outside subcontractors and suppliers

the company believes that its cash and investment balances and anticipated cash flow from operations  will be adequate to finance current operations  anticipated investments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner  or if so required  that adequate capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
factors affecting future results as described by the following factors  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods

customer concentration 
a small number of customers have accounted for a majority of the company s sales in each of the past several fiscal years 
in fiscal  nortel  mci  and compuserve accounted for   and of the company s sales  respectively  and sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s sales 
in fiscal  nortel  mci  and compuserve accounted for  and of the company s sales  respectively  and the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s sales 
in fiscal  mci and compuserve each accounted for of the company s sales and the company s top five customers accounted for of sales 
other than nortel  mci and compuserve  no customer accounted for more than of the company s revenue in fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
the company s customers are typically not contractually obligated to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period 
product sales to major customers have varied widely from year to year 
in some cases  major customers have abruptly terminated purchases of the company s products 
for example  sales of the company s single purpose network access products to at t paradyne represented of sales in fiscal  but declined to and of sales in fiscal and  respectively  due to the decision by at t paradyne to focus its sales efforts on competing products developed within the at t organization 
in addition  sales to stratacom  inc for provision of network management capabilities in a system sold to another at t business unit accounted for of the company s sales during fiscal sales to stratacom ceased during the second half of fiscal due to the decision by such at t business unit to internally provide such management functionality in its system 
loss of  or a material reduction in orders by  one or more of the company s major customers would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see competition 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s sales are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors 
most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times 
the company s ability to affect and judge the timing of individual customer orders is limited 
the company has experienced large fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter due to a wide variety of factors  such as delay  cancellation or acceleration of customer projects  and other factors discussed below 
the company s sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments to a single customer  often related to specific equipment deployment projects 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
sales to individual current customers have varied by as much as million between consecutive quarters 
delays or lost sales can be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by other vendors of components in a customer s system  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that the company s products support and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new services 
delays and lost sales have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
operating results in recent periods have been adversely affected by delays in receipt of significant purchase orders from customers 
in addition  the company has in the past experienced delays as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer specifications 
these and similar delays or lost sales could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration  and dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not sufficient to achieve expected sales for that quarter 
to achieve its sales objective  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter 
furthermore  the company s agreements with its customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without significant penalty 
the company s customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases from the company 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in the company s operating results and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the periods in which the inventory is reduced 
the company s industry is characterized by declining prices of existing products  therefore continual improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products are required to maintain gross margins 
in response to customer demands or competitive pressures  or to pursue new product or market opportunities  the company may take certain pricing or marketing actions  such as price reductions  volume discounts  or provision of services at below market rates 
these actions could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company  its major customers or its competitors  delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future sales and are fixed in the short term to a large extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales 
any significant decline in demand relative to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company has had  and in some future quarter may have operating results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
see potential volatility of stock price 
potential volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the telecommunication network access and equipment industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these company specific factors or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its stock price and share trading volume since its initial public offering in june there is no assurance that such fluctuations will not continue 
dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
the company s future results of operations are highly dependent on market acceptance of existing and future applications for the company s access system product line 
the access system product line represented approximately of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal increased market acceptance of the company s access system products is dependent on a number of factors  not all of which are in the company s control  including the continued growth in the use of bandwidth intensive applications  continued deployment of new telecommunications services  market acceptance of integrated access devices in general  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  and the success of the company s sales efforts 
failure of the company s products to achieve increased market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to introduce new products in a timely manner could cause companies to purchase products from competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to a variety of factors  the company may experience delays in developing its planned products 
new products may require additional development work  enhancement  testing or further refinement before they can be made commercially available by the company 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the introduction of access system product applications and enhancements due to a variety of internal factors  such as reallocation of priorities  difficulty in hiring sufficient numbers of qualified personnel and unforeseen technical obstacles  as well as to changes in customer requirements 
although the company does not believe that such delays have had a material adverse effect on its customer relationships  such delays have deferred the receipt of revenue from the products involved 
if the company s access system products have performance  reliability or quality shortcomings  then the company may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses 
need to expand sales organization and channels of distribution 
currently the company sells its products to a small number of customers through a relatively small sales force 
the company s strategy is to distribute its products to a broader customer base  which will require the company to significantly expand its sales force and other channels of distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit  train  motivate and manage additional qualified sales personnel with the requisite experience and knowledge  or attract additional qualified distributors 
availability of qualified sales personnel is limited  and competition for experienced sales personnel in the network access and telecommunications equipment industries is intense 
the failure to timely expand the company s sales force and expand its channels of distribution could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration  management of growth and dependence on key personnel 
dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
the company depends in part upon suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company obtains several components and licenses certain embedded software from single sources 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company s requirements for any such components 
the company generally does not have any long term contracts with such suppliers  other than software vendors 
any significant interruption in the supply of  or degradation in the quality of  any such item could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has no current plans to significantly expand its supplier base 
purchase orders from the company s customers frequently require delivery quickly after placement of the order 
because the company does not maintain significant component inventories  delay in shipment by a supplier could lead to lost sales 
the company uses internal forecasts to determine its general materials and components requirements 
lead times for materials and components may vary significantly  and depend on factors such as specific supplier performance  contract terms and general market demand for components 
if orders vary from forecasts  the company may experience excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components 
from time to time  the company has experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in fulfillment of customer orders 
such shortages and allocations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
competition 
the market for network access and telecommunications equipment is highly competitive  and the company expects competition to increase in the future 
this market is subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments and emerging industry standards 
the company faces different competitive environments for its access system products than for its single purpose network access products 
the market for integrated access devices such as the company s access system is newly emerging and is subject to rapid change 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in this market are the development and rapid introduction of new product features  price performance  support for multiple types of communications services  network management  reliability and safety  and quality of customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company s new products and products under development will be able to compete successfully with respect to these or other factors 
the company s principal competition to date for its current access system products has been from digital link corporation  kentrox  a division of adc telecommunications both in kentrox s own products and products supplied to kentrox by premisys communications  inc  and larscom  inc 
as the company develops new products for the access system line  the company expects to increasingly compete with premisys 
the company expects additional competition from companies that are currently competitors in the market for the company s single purpose network access products  as such companies develop new products 
in addition  the company expects competition from companies in the computer networking market and other related markets such as newbridge networks corporation  telco systems  inc and ascend communications  inc 
to the extent that current or potential competitors can expand their current offerings to include products that have functionality similar to the company s products and planned products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that the market for its single purpose network access products is mature 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market are price  installed base and quality of customer support 
in this market  the company primarily competes with adtran  inc  digital link  kentrox and larscom 
there can be no assurance that such companies or other competitors will not introduce new products at a lower price and or that provide greater functionality than the company s single purpose network access products 
in addition  the company anticipates that competitors and customers may develop products that could be used for selected applications for which the company s products are currently provided 
successful  timely development of such products could reduce the level of demand for the company s products 
the company does not expect to spend significant resources  if any  on research and development of its single purpose network access products 
there can be no assurance that the company s single purpose network access products will be competitive in the future 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have long established relationships with network service providers 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial resources  technical expertise  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
rapid technological change 
the network access and telecommunications equipment markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation 
the development of new products for the integrated access market requires competence in the general areas of telephony  data networking  network management and wireless telephony as well as specific technologies such as dsl  ip  isdn and atm 
furthermore  the communications industry is characterized by the need to design products which meet industry standards for safety  emissions and network interconnection 
with new and emerging technologies and service offerings from network service providers  such standards are often changing or unavailable 
as a result  there is a potential for product development delay due to the need for compliance with new or modified standards 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that the company manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if the company were to be unsuccessful  or to incur significant delays  in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements 
see dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
management of growth 
the company has recently experienced and may continue to experience growth in the number of its employees and the scope of its operations 
in particular  the company intends to increase its sales  marketing and support staff 
these increases will result in increased responsibilities for management 
to manage potential future growth effectively  the company must improve its operational  financial and management information systems and must hire  train  motivate and manage a growing number of employees 
the future success of the company also will depend on its ability to increase its customer support capability and to attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing and management personnel  for whom competition is intense 
in particular  the current availability of qualified sales and engineering personnel is quite limited  and competition among companies for such personnel is intense 
the company is currently attempting to hire a number of sales and engineering personnel and has experienced delays in filling such positions 
during strong business cycles  the company expects to experience continued difficulty in filling its needs for qualified sales  engineering and other personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively achieve or manage any such growth  and failure to do so could delay product development cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see need to expand sales organization and channels of distribution  dependence on key personnel 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories and bell communications research 
for some public carrier services  installed equipment does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of the company s products 
standards for new services such as frame relay and atm are still evolving 
as these standards evolve  the company will be required to modify its products or develop and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the pricing of existing as well as new public network services and therefore are expected to affect demand for such services and the telecommunications products that support such services 
tariff rates  whether determined by network service providers or in response to regulatory directives  may affect the cost effectiveness of deploying communication services 
such policies also affect demand for telecommunications equipment  including the company s products 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company has had minimal direct sales to international customers to date 
the company has little experience in international markets  but intends to expand sales of its products outside of the united states and to enter certain international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent any company sales are denominated in foreign currency  the company s sales and results of operations may also be directly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the united states could delay or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
the company has not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent issues and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  would relate to the company s products 
software comprises a substantial portion of the technology in the company s products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to the company if the company discovers third party patents related to its software products or if such patents are asserted against the company in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may issue which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
the company may receive communications from third parties in the future asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in its distribution agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify its customers for any expenses or liabilities  generally without limitation  resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the failure of the company to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
limited protection of intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
the company has been issued certain us and canadian patents with respect to limited aspects of its single purpose network access technology 
the company has not obtained significant patent protection for its access system technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties have not or will not develop equivalent technologies or products without infringing the company s patents or that the company s patents would be held valid and enforceable by a court having jurisdiction over a dispute involving such patents 
the company has also entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees  and enters into non disclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of the company s technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of misappropriation of the company s technology and products more likely 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of its executive officers and key management  sales and technical personnel  including leigh s 
belden  the company s president and chief executive officer  and steven c 
taylor  the company s chief technical officer 
except for employment agreements with mr 
belden and mr 
taylor  the company does not have employment agreements with any other of such persons 
each of the company s executive officers  and key management  sales and technical personnel would be difficult to replace 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key personnel  or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management of growth 
control of the company  antitakeover effects of certain charter provisions 
the current officers  directors and holders of five percent or more of the company s common stock own approximately of the outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  if they were to act as a group  would effectively be able to elect all of the company s directors  increase the authorized capital and otherwise control the policies of the company 
the company s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
the company has no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
in addition  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which will prohibit the company from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company 
furthermore  certain provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation  including provisions that provide for the board of directors to be divided into three classes to serve for staggered three year terms  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
