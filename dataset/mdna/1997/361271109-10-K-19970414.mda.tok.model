item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial and operating data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  versus the year ended december net income for the year ended december   increased approximately million  or  from the previous year 
the major component of this increase was the million extraordinary gain which resulted from the surrender of the property located at north bedford drive in beverly hills  california to the holder of the million lien on the property 
the book value of the land  buildings and related assets associated with the north bedford property was approximately million at the time of the transaction 
in conjunction with the transfer  the company recorded a million loss on disposition of the property which was the difference between the million book value and the estimated market value of million 
at the same time  the company recorded a million extraordinary gain resulting from the elimination of debt  which represented the difference between the million loan balance and the estimated million market value of the property 
the million extraordinary gain was partially offset by  of other extraordinary net gains and losses resulting from the early retirement of three other notes payable 
for reporting purposes  the net extraordinary gain was adjusted to approximately million to reflect the portion of the gain attributable to the minority interest partners 
rents  tenant reimbursements and parking revenues as a group declined approximately million from an aggregate of approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in this decline was mainly attributed to the north bedford drive property which the company surrendered to the noteholder on may  subsequent to that date  the noteholder put the property on the market for sale and on august   the company  through the medical partnership  reacquired the property 
during the period from may  to august   the property generated  in rents  tenant reimbursements and parking revenues which were earned by the entity that owned the property during that time 
the remaining  decline is attributable to rents received on leases that expired during and and renewed at lower rates 
interest  loan fees and related revenues are primarily the result of investments in short term loans secured by senior care facilities 
the senior loan program  started in june  has continued to expand since its inception 
investments made in combined with new loans in contributed to the increase in such revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in in february  the company completed a transaction whereby the company provided the initial capital and management expertise to facilitate the purchase of a newly constructed but vacant hospital and medical office facility in rancho cucamonga  california by heritage rancho healthcare  inc  a nebraska nonprofit corporation heritage 
heritage converted the hospital into a long term care facility to benefit the local community 
in conjunction with the closing of this transaction  the company recognized cash revenues of  and received a  ten year subordinated note  which the company sold during the fourth quarter of for approximately  plus accrued interest 
property operating expense increased approximately  or  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  recurring operating expenses declined as a result of the north bedford drive transactions as previously discussed 
this decline was more than offset by increases in real property taxes  the increased expense of earthquake insurance and the acquisition of the tustin properties 
in june  the los angeles county assessor s office notified the company that it was increasing its valuation on four of the bedford drive properties as a result of a transfer of ownership in conjunction with the company s initial public offering the ipo on december  the company retained consultants specializing in property valuation appeals and  as of march   obtained partial reductions in the increased assessments on two of the four properties 
although there can be no assurances  management believes that the company will be able to obtain further reductions in these increased assessments 
the addition of earthquake insurance partially contributed to the rise in operating expense 
in  earthquake coverage was added on four properties  and in  coverage was added on four additional properties 
as of december   the sherman oaks  regents and cigna healthcare properties all had coverage for certain losses resulting from seismic activity  as do the five properties located on bedford drive 
the acquisition of the tustin properties also contributed to an increase in the company s operating expense during at the time of the acquisition  the hospital was vacant and the medical office buildings were approximately occupied by doctors who were affiliated with the hospital before its closure 
the company s management is currently working to revitalize these assets 
the company is currently involved in discussions with several health care organizations to lease the hospital and additional space in the medical office buildings 
although there can be no assurance that these discussions will be successfully completed  management believes the company will obtain a lease for the vacant hospital under favorable terms during depreciation and amortization expenses declined from approximately million during to approximately million in the decline is primarily the result of the north bedford drive transactions discussed above 
prior to its transfer in may  the property had a depreciable cost basis of approximately million 
when the property was reacquired in august  the depreciable cost basis dropped to approximately million 
also  no depreciation was recorded for the period during which the company did not own the property 
the decline in depreciation and amortization was partially offset by the acquisition of the tustin properties in june interest expense increased from approximately million for the months ended december  to approximately million for the same period in  an increase of approximately 
funding of the senior care loan program was the primary reason for the increase 
the increase would have been larger had it not been for the decline in interest expense which was realized when a million loan was extinguished in may by the transfer of the north bedford drive property to the noteholder 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the same period in  as a result of added travel and professional fees resulting from the expansion of the senior loan program 
comparison of the year ended december  versus the year ended december net income for the year ended december   before an extraordinary item  was million  or per share  an increase of from million  or per share  reported in the previous year  based on  and  average shares outstanding  respectively 
net income after the effect of an extraordinary item of  or per share  was million or per share 
the extraordinary item related to a one time charge in the third quarter for repayment of approximately million in variable rate debt with a million fixed rate year loan  and the replacement of the company s credit line 
revenues increased million  or  in  as a result of the properties acquired during and added revenues from the newly created senior care division 
rent revenues including tenant reimbursements and parking fees increased million from million to million 
this increase was due primarily to the acquisition of the following five properties in holy cross medical plaza in january  regents medical center in june  sherman oaks medical plaza in june  cigna healthcare building in july and irvine boulevard in october 
operations for the year ended december   included only partial year revenues for all of the five properties except for the irvine boulevard building 
the revenues benefited from a full year of operations except for the irvine boulevard building which was placed in service in august of the mob division also benefited from higher occupancy rates for  up from an average of in in late  the company changed its collection practices and made a deliberate effort to pursue all delinquent accounts 
some were resolved in direct negotiations with tenants while others were litigated 
by the end of  substantially all delinquencies were resolved through judgments  payment plans or dissolutions 
the previous backlog of uncollected rents has been reduced through a combination of collections and write offs 
under generally accepted accounting principals  the company is required to average the billable rent due over the term of its leases and include a portion of future years billable rent increases in the current year s rent revenues 
this accounting practice creates an unbilled rent receivable from the company s tenants 
in conjunction with the preparation of its financial statements  the company reviews all receivable accounts  including its unbilled rent receivable for purposes of determining the collectability of such receivables 
management believes that the overall trend toward larger medical provider groups has contributed toward the financial stability of the existing tenant population which  in turn  has led to improved collections of monthly rent billings 
this improved collections rate has allowed the company to decrease its allowance for doubtful accounts including the corresponding allowance for unbilled rent receivable 
the company believes that the current level of allowance is appropriate 
beginning late in the second quarter of  the company began recognizing revenues from its new senior care division 
interest and loan fees totaled million in versus  in total expenses increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the majority of the increase was the result of added interest expense which climbed million from million in to million in two factors fueled the increase higher debt and increased rates of interest 
outstanding debt increased from million to million at december  and  respectively 
in general  interest rates were up from and this was amplified by the fact that rate caps on the company s interest rate protection agreements also increased from in to in property operating expense and depreciation also increased from to the overall increase of million is primarily the result of showing a full year of expense for the acquired properties 
the effect of increased operating expense was partially offset by a  difference relating to costs and reimbursements from the northridge earthquake 
general and administrative costs increased  at about the same rate as revenues  largely as a result of investments in consulting services  travel  professional and other fees related to creating the new senior care division 
liquidity and capital resources the company obtains its liquidity from multiple internal and external sources 
internally  funds are derived from the operation of medical offices and senior care lending activities and primarily consist of ffo less dividends 
since the ipo  external sources have primarily consisted of various secured loans and lines of credit 
the company s ability to expand its medical office and senior care lending operations requires continued access to capital to fund new acquisitions and loans 
during  the company s payout ratio was approximately of its funds from operations 
undistributed ffo were used internally to fund maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the company s existing properties

funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of a reit 
the company s financial statements use the concept of ffo as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo is calculated to include the minority interests share of income since the operating partnership s net income is allocated proportionately among all owners of operating partnership units 
the number of operating partnership units held by the company is identical to the number of outstanding shares of the company s common stock  and owners of operating partnership units may  at their discretion  convert their units into shares of common stock on a one for one basis 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the operating results of the company  ffo should be examined in conjunction with the company s net income as presented in the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k and the additional data presented below 
the table on the following page presents an analysis of ffo and additional data for each of the four quarters and the year ended december  for the operating partnership g l realty corp

ffo is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by nareit effective as of january  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other indicator developed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  consistently applied  including measures of liquidity such as cash flows from operations  investing  and financing activities 
ffo is helpful in evaluating the performance of a real estate portfolio considering the fact that historical cost accounting assumes the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
ffo is only one of a range of indicators which should be considered in determining a company s operating performance 
the methods of calculating ffo among different companies are subject to variation  therefore  ffo may be an invalid measure for purposes of comparing companies 
also  the elimination of depreciation and gains and losses on sales of property may not be a true indicator of an entity s ability to recover its investments in properties
