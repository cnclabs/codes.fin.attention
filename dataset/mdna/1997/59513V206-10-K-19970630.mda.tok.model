item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview spectrum holobyte  inc the company derives revenue primarily from publishing and distributing entertainment software 
this software is generally published by the company for the following platforms compact disc read only memory cd rom for the personal computer pc 
videogame consoles  which include bit next generation systems 
in addition  the company generates revenue from the licensing of its products to third party publishers and the distribution of third party software and related products 
the company generates a substantial portion of its revenue from the introduction of new products 
in order to maintain or grow its current revenue levels  the company believes it will be necessary to develop or obtain rights to new products that achieve market acceptance  are developed for the appropriate platforms  are introduced in a timely manner and are able to sustain market acceptance 
the company is continuing to devote considerable resources toward the development of new products and has secured rights to intellectual properties owned by third parties 
as is typical in the industry  the company maintains internally developed release schedules  but there can be no assurance that new products under development will be released on schedule or at all  or that any such products will generate significant revenue 
historically  the company has frequently missed product release schedules 
to the extent that major new products are not released on schedule  both net revenue and net income are likely to be adversely affected 
in addition  as access to distribution channels and retail shelf space becomes increasingly competitive  the company s ability to produce and bring to market new and compelling products in a timely fashion plays an increasingly important role in the company s ability to retain adequate access to these channels 
the company s operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
this variability is a result of factors such as volume shipments of significant new products  the degree of market acceptance of the company s products  the introduction of products competitive with those of the company  the timing and market acceptance of new hardware and software product introductions  the size and growth rate of the consumer software market  the seasonality of sales  development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new products or new versions of existing products  product returns and markdowns  changes in pricing policies by the company and its competitors  the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand  the timing of orders from major customers  order cancellations  delays of shipment  and write offs of advance royalty payments 
because a majority of the unit sales for most product typically occurs in the first to days following the introduction of the product  the company s revenue may increase significantly in a period in which one or more major product introductions occur and may decline in following periods or in periods in which there are no major product introductions 
the company s expenses are based  in part  on expected future revenue 
certain overhead and product development expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary directly with revenue 
consequently  if net revenue is below expectations  the company s operating results are likely to be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the market price of the company s shares could be adversely impacted in future periods 
the entertainment software business is highly seasonal 
typically  net revenue is highest during the last calendar quarter which includes the holiday buying season  declines in the first calendar quarter  is lowest in the second and increases in the third calendar quarter 
this seasonal pattern is due primarily to the increased demand for entertainment software products during the year end holiday buying season 
the company s net revenue  however  is largely dependent on releases of major new products and  as such  may not necessarily reflect the seasonal patterns of the industry as a whole 
the company expects that its net revenue and operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company may  from time to time  make oral forward looking statements 
the factors discussed herein and in the company s securities and exchange commission filings  including but not limited to item of the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march   are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements 
operating results consolidated net revenue for fiscal  and consisted of the following dollars in thousands amount change of consolidated net revenue by territory north america    international    consolidated    by platform type cd rom    videogame    licensing oem    distribution    floppy disk and other    consolidated    the increase in consolidated fiscal net revenue was largely due to the strong success of two pc cd rom titles  grand prix ii  a racing simulation game released in fiscal  and sid meier s civilization registered trademark ii  a strategy game released late in fiscal net revenue related to these two products comprised approximately of fiscal consolidated net revenue 
the increases in the amount and proportion of international revenue were mostly due to european shipments of grand prix ii 
approximately of the grand prix ii revenue for fiscal was generated internationally 
other significant fiscal pc cd rom releases included master of orion tm ii and magic the gathering registered trademark 
the increase in videogame revenue in fiscal was due to the release of three videogame console titles as compared to one title in fiscal the three fiscal titles all for the sony playstation tm were top gun tm fire at will tm  gunship registered trademark  and x com terror from the deep tm 
in total  the company released eight new products in fiscal as compared to new products released in fiscal the average unit volume per new title during the year of release increased significantly  however  from approximately  units in fiscal to  units in fiscal the decrease in the number of new products released and the increase in the number of units shipped per title were due to the company s focus on a fewer number of titles with greater market appeal 
there can be no assurances that the company s continued focus on this strategy will be successful 
net revenue in fiscal was also favorably impacted by a percentage decrease in the provisions recorded for returns and markdowns 
these decreases were due to a focused effort to better manage inventories of the company s products in the distribution channel and better product sell through 
distribution revenue includes shipments of computer software and related products published or manufactured by third parties and distributed by the company  including shipments under affiliated label agreements to distribute third party entertainment software titles 
in late fiscal  the company terminated most of its us affiliated label agreements 
in fiscal  the company acquired a majority interest in leisuresoft gmbh  a german distribution company 
substantially all of the distribution revenue generated in fiscal relates to shipments by leisuresoft 
the increase in distribution revenue in fiscal was due to an increase in the number of new affiliated label titles released  which increased from three in fiscal to eight in fiscal in fiscal  the proportion of net revenue generated from floppy disk and other products decreased and the proportion of net revenue generated from cd rom products increased due to the transition of the personal computer entertainment market towards fully integrated  multimedia products on the cd rom platform 
this trend continued in fiscal  and the company is generating virtually no floppy disk revenue 
videogame console revenue declined in fiscal as the company ceased developing or selling products for bit and bit console platforms 
the fiscal decline in licensing oem net revenue was due to the company s election to distribute a number of older titles at reduced prices through retail channels rather than through oem channels 
gross profit consisted of the following dollars in thousands amount change of consolidated net revenue gross profit    gross profit as a percentage of consolidated net revenue increased in fiscal due to reductions in both the direct per unit costs of products shipped and the amounts provided for in house and channel inventory reserves 
the direct per unit costs decreased due to a reduction in the cost of both materials and outside order fulfillment services 
the amounts provided for inventory reserves declined in fiscal as significant charges related to floppy disk products were made in fiscal partially offsetting these increases in fiscal gross margins were declines caused by increased revenue from lower margin distribution and next generation products 
the company believes that gross profit could be adversely impacted in future periods by an increased proportion of distribution revenue  increased license royalties and by competitive pricing pressures 
operating expenses were as follows dollars in thousands amount change of consolidated net revenue sales and marketing    general and administrative    research and development    restructuring charges  total operating costs    the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal was largely due to a decline in variable marketing costs due to fewer new product releases and due to high fiscal promotional costs related to the release of the pc versions of star trek the next generation tm a final unity tm and top gun fire at will 
in addition  certain redundant domestic sales and marketing functions were eliminated or consolidated during fiscal the decrease in fiscal costs as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in distributor and retailer cooperative marketing costs and the reorganization of certain domestic marketing and sales functions million 
in addition  variable marketing costs decreased due to the release of fewer new products in fiscal the increase in general and administrative costs in fiscal included increased charges for bad debt expense million and incentive compensation million 
before these charges  general and administrative costs decreased by approximately million due to a domestic consolidation in certain administrative functions and reductions in professional fees  severance costs and recruiting costs 
the increase in general and administrative costs from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in the provision for bad debts related to specific customer accounts and to costs related to turnover in executive and administrative staff 
partially offsetting these increases was a million reduction due to the consolidation of certain domestic administrative functions 
research and development costs decreased in fiscal due partially to the elimination of redundant product test functions million and certain product development headcount in the company s maryland and uk studios million 
in addition  write offs of development advances decreased by million as the company canceled a larger number of products in fiscal as a part of the strategic refocusing of its product lines 
the increase in research and development costs in fiscal was due to higher costs associated with the development of full multimedia products for cd rom and next generation hardware platforms  research and development expenses of million associated with the simtex development studio  acquired in the first quarter of fiscal through a pooling of interests research and development expenditures in prior fiscal periods were not restated for the simtex acquisition due to the immateriality of the related simtex expenditures  and the write off of million of development advances associated with discontinued projects as part of the company s continued efforts to refocus its product lines 
the fiscal restructuring charges of approximately million included severance costs related to the company s downsizing efforts  reserves on inventories related to terminated affiliated label publishing agreements  and charges to write down the net assets of the company s wholly owned japanese subsidiary to their estimated realizable values 
the following table sets forth other income and expense  provision for income taxes and extraordinary items dollars in thousands amount change of consolidated net revenue other income expense  net  provision for income taxes extraordinary item  net of tax effect  other income increased in fiscal due primarily to the following factors a million gain was recorded in fiscal on the sale of the company s investment in fasa interactive technologies  inc  equity losses and writedowns of million were recorded in fiscal from the company s investment in ot sports  inc  this investment was sold in early fiscal for its net book value of  interest expense was down in fiscal due to a reduction in borrowings under notes and revolving lines of credit  and net foreign currency transaction gains increased 
the net expense recorded in fiscal was due mostly to interest expense million recorded on the october debt financing and the losses related to ot sports 
the fiscal provision for income taxes was made to provide for earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the extraordinary item recorded in fiscal reflects the gains realized upon the repurchase or the conversion to equity of a portion of the company s subordinated notes at a discount from face value 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to over million and cash increased million to approximately million during fiscal the main sources of funds in fiscal were from operations and from a private placement of common stock 
the company generated positive cash flows from operations during fiscal due to the net income generated  strong collections of receivables and non cash increases in certain accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable decreased as days sales outstanding declined from days at march to days at march in fiscal  the company generated million from financing activities and used million in investing activities 
private placements of  shares of common stock generated approximately million in proceeds  net of associated issuance costs including placement fees 
the company repurchased million of notes see below for approximately million of cash  and exchanged another million of notes for  shares of series b and b preferred stock 
the investing activities included investments in property and equipment and in leisuresoft 
on october   the company completed a private offering of million face value convertible subordinated notes the notes pursuant to rule a of the securities act of net proceeds to the company approximated million  after discounts  commissions and other issuance costs 
the notes  which bear interest at the rate of percent per annum  will mature on september   and are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at any time after days following the latest date of original issuance through maturity  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share subject to adjustment for certain events 
the notes may be redeemed at the option of the company subsequent to september   in whole or in part  at various declining redemption prices from to  together with accrued interest thereon 
the notes may also be redeemed at the option of the holder at upon the occurrence of certain events 
as of march   notes with a face value of approximately million were outstanding 
the substantial debt incurred by the company will have several important consequences for the company s future operations  including the following a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest on  and principal of  its indebtedness  the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  and the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures  adverse economic conditions and adverse changes in governmental regulations and to make acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise may be negatively impacted 
the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will be dependent upon its future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to service its debt  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of such debt  including the notes  or to obtain additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that any refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained 
the company has an overdraft line of credit facility in the uk that is based upon qualifying receivables and certain other bank requirements for amounts up to a maximum credit limit of  pounds sterling approximately million at march  
this facility bears interest at the rate of over the bank s base rate  and expires september  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to renegotiate this facility upon its expiration or that any additional borrowing facilities will be made available to the company on acceptable terms 
management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity and capital needs for the next months 
risk factors the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company may  from time to time  make oral forward looking statements 
the factors discussed above and in the company s securities and exchange commission filings  as well as the following  are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements 
the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business prospects 
operating results 
although the company reported net income for the year ended march  of million or per share  the company had net losses of approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company s business strategies and tactics will be successful and that the company will be able to generate profitability in future quarterly or annual periods 
in particular  the company announced that it expects to report a loss in the first quarter of fiscal of between and per share 
fluctuations in operating results  seasonality 
the company s operating results have varied significantly in the past  and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
this variability is a result of factors such as volume shipments of significant new products  the degree of market acceptance of the company s products  the introduction of products competitive with those of the company  the timing and market acceptance of new hardware and software product introductions  the size and growth rate of the consumer software market  the seasonality of sales  development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new products or new versions of existing products  product returns and markdowns  changes in pricing policies by the company and its competitors  the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand  the timing of orders from major customers  order cancellations  delays of shipment  and write offs of advance royalty payments 
because a majority of the unit sales for a product typically occurs in the first to days following the introduction of the product  the company s revenue may increase significantly in a period in which a major product introduction occurs and may decline in following periods or in periods in which there are no major product introductions 
the company s expenses are based  in part  on expected future revenue 
certain overhead and product development expenses are fixed and do not vary directly in relation to revenue 
consequently  if net revenue is below expectations  the company s operating results are likely to be materially and adversely affected 
in certain past periods the company s revenue or operating results were below the expectations of  and certain new products were not introduced when anticipated by  public market analysts and investors 
these circumstances could recur in future periods  and in such event  the prices of the company s common stock and notes would likely be materially and adversely affected 
the entertainment software business is highly seasonal 
typically  net revenue is highest during the last calendar quarter which includes the holiday buying season  declines in the first calendar quarter  is lowest in the second and increases in the third calendar quarter 
this seasonal pattern is due primarily to the increased demand for entertainment software products during the year end holiday buying season 
the company s net revenue  however  is largely dependent on releases of major new products and  as such  may not necessarily reflect the seasonal patterns of the industry as a whole 
the company expects that its net revenue and operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
significant leverage 
as of march   the company had outstanding indebtedness for borrowed funds of approximately million and cumulative manditorily redeemable preferred stock of million 
this substantial leverage will have several important consequences for the company s future operations  including the following i a substantial portion of the company s cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest on  and principal of  its indebtedness  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  and iii the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures  adverse economic conditions and adverse changes in governmental regulations and to make acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise may be negatively impacted 
the company in the future may enter into lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements  any of which would add to the total outstanding indebtedness of the company 
the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt  it may be required to convert or refinance all or a portion of such debt  including the notes see below  or to obtain additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that any refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained 
dependence on new product introductions  product delays 
a significant portion of the company s fiscal year revenue is generated by products introduced during that fiscal year 
the company depends on both the timely introduction of successful new products or sequels to existing products to replace declining revenue from older products and continued revenue from back catalog products 
if for any reason revenue from new products or other activities fails to replace declining revenue from existing products  or if revenue from back catalog titles declines significantly  the company s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
in order to maintain or grow its current revenue levels  the company believes it will be necessary to develop or obtain rights to new products that achieve and sustain market acceptance  are developed for the appropriate platforms and are introduced in a timely manner 
the company is continuing to devote considerable resources toward the development of new products and has secured rights to intellectual properties owned by third parties 
as is typical in the industry  while the company maintains internally developed release schedules  there can be no assurance that new products under development will be released on schedule or at all  or that any such products will generate significant revenue 
historically  the company has frequently missed product release schedules 
to the extent that major new products are not released on schedule  both net revenue and gross profit are likely to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  as access to distribution channels and retail shelf space becomes increasingly competitive  the company s ability to produce and bring to market new and compelling products in a timely fashion plays an increasingly important role in the company s ability to retain adequate access to these channels 
the company s current production schedules contemplate that the company will commence shipments of a number of new products in fiscal as with any software product  however  until all aspects of the development and initial distribution of a game are completed  there can be no assurance of its release date 
release dates will vary depending on quality assurance testing and other development factors 
if the company were unable to commence volume shipments of a significant new product during the scheduled quarter  the company s revenue and earnings would likely be materially and adversely affected in that quarter 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays in the introduction of certain new products 
it is likely in the future that certain new products will not be released in accordance with the company s internal development schedule or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
a significant delay in the introduction of  or the presence of a defect in  one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of such products and on the company s business  operating results and financial condition  particularly in the quarter in which such products were scheduled to be introduced 
the process of developing software products such as those offered by the company is extremely complex and is expected to become more complex and expensive in the future as consumers demand products with more sophisticated and elaborate multimedia features and as new platforms and technologies are supported 
at the same time  the introduction of new technologies and competitive products  the increase in competition for retail shelf space among software products and other factors may cause the effective lives of the company s products to become shorter and the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis to become increasingly important 
as the company intends to focus its resources on a smaller number of titles  its exposure to the risks of delays of any one title will increase 
uncertainty of market acceptance  unpredictable product life cycles 
consumer preferences for entertainment software products are continually and rapidly changing and are extremely difficult to predict 
few entertainment software products achieve sustained market acceptance  for example  beyond one holiday buying season 
there can be no assurance that new products introduced by the company will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  or that acceptance  if achieved  will be sustained for any significant period 
further  there can be no assurance that such products will not be subject to changes in consumer preferences or that product life cycles will be sufficient to permit the company to recover development and other associated costs 
in addition  sales of any single title of the company s entertainment software products will decline over time 
a majority of the unit sales for a product typically occurs in the first to days after the product is introduced 
therefore  the company cannot rely on the sales of current products to sustain its business in the future 
failure of new products or platforms to achieve or sustain market acceptance would have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company does not carry significant inventory of its new products 
as a result  significant production delays would have a material and adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
further  if demand for a particular product is greater than anticipated  the company may not have sufficient inventory to meet customer demands 
competition 
the entertainment software industry is intensely competitive and in the process of consolidation 
the company s competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than those of the company 
the company competes primarily with other developers of pc entertainment and video game entertainment software 
significant competitors of the company in the entertainment software industry include electronic arts  cuc international  lucas arts  interplay  gt interactive  acclaim entertainment  and broderbund software  along with virgin interactive in europe 
the success of one or more of these companies or the entry and participation of new companies  including diversified entertainment companies  may adversely affect the company s future performance 
the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in the entertainment software industry  principally as a result of the technical sophistication of advanced multimedia computer game products requiring substantial investments in research and development and the increasing need to license products and rights to use other intellectual properties from third parties 
also  competitors with large product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers and distributors and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to such competitors most popular titles 
many games of the company s competitors are developing on line interactive computer games that will be competitive with the company s products 
as competition increases  significant price competition and reduced profit margins may result 
in addition  competition from new technologies may reduce demand in markets in which the company has traditionally competed 
prolonged price competition or reduced demand as a result of competing technologies would have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially and adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
retailers of the company s products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources  and there is intense competition among consumer software producers for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support from retailers 
to the extent that the number of consumer software products and computer platforms increases  this competition for shelf space may intensify 
due to increased competition for limited shelf space  retailers and distributors are increasingly in a better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale  including promotional discounts and product return policies 
retailers often require software publishers to pay fees in exchange for preferred shelf space 
the company s products constitute a relatively small percentage of a retailer s sales volume  and there can be no assurance that retailers will continue to purchase the company s products or provide the company s products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 
as more consumers own multimedia pcs  the distribution channels for entertainment software have changed  and are expected to continue to change  to increasingly depend on mass merchandisers  online services and the internet to reach the broader market 
in addition  while this trend has increased the number of distribution channels  it has intensified competition for shelf space because these new channels generally carry only top selling titles 
in addition  other types of retail outlets and methods of product distribution  such as online services and the internet  may become important in the future  and it will be important for the company to gain access to these channels of distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company will gain such access or that the company s access will allow the company to maintain its historical levels of sales volume 
concentration of customer base  risk of customer business failure  product returns 
the company principally sells its products to retailers and distributors  who in turn resell the products to consumers 
during the year ended march   sales to the top ten such customers represented approximately of the company s net revenue 
sales are typically made on credit  with terms that vary depending upon the customer and the nature of the product 
the company does require collateral to secure payment 
retailers and distributors compete in a volatile industry and are subject to the risk of business failure 
certain of the company s distributors and retailers have recently experienced financial difficulties and the company has increased its reserves accordingly 
however  the business failure of a significant distributor or customer could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company is exposed to the risk of product returns from distributors and retailers 
the company currently maintains a stock balancing policy that allows distributors and retailers to return products subject to certain conditions 
the company provides reserves for returns that it believes are adequate  and the company s agreements with various customers place certain limits on product returns 
however  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  or changes in consumer demand from that anticipated  could cause customers to seek to return inventory to the company 
due to the unpredictability of consumer demand and the uncertainties associated with a rapidly changing market  there can be no assurance that the company or its customers will be able to forecast demand accurately 
any significant amount of product returns or markdowns could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence upon strategic relationships 
the company s business strategy relies to a significant extent on its strategic relationships with other companies and on its alliances with key developers 
certain agreements allow third parties to approve a product prior to its release  and therefore  subject the product to delay 
there can be no assurance that these relationships will be successful or that the company will continue to maintain and develop strategic relationships  or that licenses between the company and any third party will be renewed or extended at their expiration dates 
the company s failure to renew or extend a key license or maintain its strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  under certain key license agreements  the company must obtain approval on a timely basis from the licensor in order to market products it develops under the license 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain such approval  and failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and business prospects 
the company has made certain minority equity investments that it believes will provide future access to products  technologies or distribution channels 
management performs ongoing evaluations of the future realization of these investments  and charges any declines in value that are other than temporary in nature to other expense in its quarterly consolidated statements of operations 
a write down of one or more of these investments could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
changes in technology and product platforms 
the market for entertainment software  including entertainment software platforms  is undergoing rapid technological change 
as a result  the company must continually anticipate and adapt its products to emerging platforms and evolving consumer preferences 
the introduction of new platforms and technologies can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
development of entertainment software products for new hardware platforms requires substantial investments in research and development for technologies such as enhanced sound  digitized speech  music and video and requires the company to anticipate and develop products for those platforms that will ultimately be successful 
such research and development efforts  which generally require to months  must occur well in advance of the release of new platforms in order to introduce products on a timely basis following the release of such platforms 
in addition  the company expects that the trend toward more complex multimedia products and increasing product development costs will continue for the foreseeable future 
although the company intends to develop and market games for certain advanced and emerging platforms  these development and marketing efforts may require greater financial and technical resources than those currently possessed by the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the platforms for which the company develops products will achieve market acceptance and  as a result  there can be no assurance that the company s development efforts with respect to such new platforms will lead to marketable products or products that generate sufficient revenue to offset research and development costs incurred in connection with their development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing products for new platforms 
failure to develop products for new platforms that achieve significant market acceptance may have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company is developing games that may be played interactively over on line services and the internet  but there can be no assurance that the market for networked videogame play will evolve or develop as anticipated 
consumer preferences change continually and are extremely difficult to predict 
even if a market for networked videogame play develops  no assurance can be given that the company s products will meet the requirements of such market and achieve market acceptance 
the company is heavily dependent on the success of the entertainment software developed for use on the pc 
however  there are multiple  competing and incompatible formats being introduced in this new market 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategy of developing primarily for the pc or the other platforms the company chooses to support ultimately will be successful 
the development  marketing and distribution of products for game consoles the company chooses to support will involve substantial investment and risks 
the company believes that the principal target audience for game consoles may be younger than the company s traditional customers  and there can be no assurance that the company s products will be successful with this different audience 
in addition  the company anticipates that products in the game console market will require substantially greater expenditures for marketing  advertising and inventory buildup  often before the market acceptance of a product is known 
inventory will be two or more times more expensive as a result of license fees that are required to be prepaid to the manufacturers of the hardware platforms 
further  game console products will be sold through channels that overlap with  but are somewhat different from  the retail channels currently utilized by the company  and the company will be competing in distribution against much larger organizations with greater financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in marketing and distributing software for game consoles 
risk of software errors or failures 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released 
in the past  the company has discovered software errors in certain of its product offerings after their introduction and has experienced delays or lost revenue during the period required to correct these errors 
the company s products must maintain compatibility with certain hardware  software and accessories 
any changes that result in incompatibility could result in significant product returns and customer service costs 
in particular  the pc hardware environment is characterized by a wide variety of nonstandard peripherals such as sound and graphics cards and configurations that make prerelease testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the risk of undetected product errors can be expected to increase as products and their development processes become more complex and as growing competition leads to increased pressure to reduce time to market 
dependence on key personnel  management changes 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key product development  technical and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees  including additional management personnel 
the loss of certain key employees could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company depends on teams of programmers  game designers and artists 
competition for these skilled employees is intense  and the loss of the services of key development personnel could have a material and adverse effect upon the company s current business  new product development efforts and prospects 
since january   the company has hired a new senior vice president of sales  senior vice president of operations  senior vice president of marketing  and a senior vice president of development studios and intends to hire other senior management positions including a new chief financial officer 
the company has also hired a financial consultant to advise the chief executive officer on financial planning  controls and reporting structures 
there can be no assurance that qualified personnel can be readily identified and hired wherever necessary  that any new personnel will be successfully integrated into the company  its operations and culture  or that new personnel  if hired  will improve the company s business  operations or operating results 
the company does not currently have key person life insurance on any employees 
use of independent software developers 
in addition to marketing internally developed software  the company also markets entertainment software created by independent software developers 
the cost to retain independent developers is increasing in the form of guaranteed advances and royalties 
additionally  the company has less control over the scheduling and the quality of work of independent contractors than that of its own employees 
furthermore  the company s agreements to publish and market certain independent software developers titles will terminate after specified dates unless renewed 
the company s business and future operating results will depend in part on the company s continued ability to attract and maintain relationships with skilled independent software developers  and to enter into and renew product development agreements with such developers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or enter into and renew such agreements 
international revenue 
international net revenue represented approximately   and of the company s net revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company expects that international net revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenue in future periods 
international revenue is subject to inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other economic barriers  fluctuating exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
for example  the company attempts to minimize its exposure to currency fluctuations by entering into forward currency contracts  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful at mitigating currency risks 
in some markets  localization of the company s products is essential to achieve market penetration 
the company may incur substantial costs and experience delays in localizing its products  and there can be no assurance that any localized product will ever generate significant revenue 
these or other factors could have a material and adverse effect on the company s future international revenue and  consequently  on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
recovery of prepaid royalties and guarantees 
the company  from time to time  enters into agreements with licensors of intellectual property and developers of games that involve royalty advances and guaranteed minimum royalty payments 
if the sales volumes of products subject to such arrangements are not sufficient to recover such advances and guarantees  the company will be required to write off unrecovered portions of such payments 
the company has been required to write off a material portion of these advances in past fiscal quarters and  if the company must write off additional portions of such advances or accrue for the guarantees  its results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
intellectual property 
the company regards the software that it owns or licenses as proprietary and relies primarily on a combination of copyrights  trade secret laws  patent and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other copy protection methods to protect its product and proprietary rights 
it is the company s policy that all employees and third party developers sign nondisclosure agreements 
there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to protect the company s intellectual property rights against infringement 
the company owns or licenses various trademarks and copyrights 
however  the company has no license agreements with the end users of its products and does not copy protect its software 
rather  the company relies on the copyright laws to prevent unauthorized distribution of its software 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy the company s products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
further  the laws of certain countries in which the company s products are or may be distributed do not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company believes that its products  trademarks and other proprietary rights do not infringe on the proprietary rights of parties 
as the number of entertainment software products in the industry increases  the company believes that software increasingly will become the subject of claims that such software infringes upon the rights of others 
from time to time  the company has received communications from parties asserting that features or content of certain of its products may infringe upon intellectual property rights of such parties 
the company believes such claims have been without merit 
to date  no such claims have had an adverse effect on the company s ability to develop  market or sell its products 
there can be no assurance that existing or future infringement claims against the company will not result in costly litigation or require the company to license the intellectual property rights of parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
strategic restructuring 
in fiscal and early fiscal  the company undertook a strategic restructuring with the goals of better integrating the operations of spectrum holobyte and microprose  streamlining product development efforts and reducing operating costs 
certain domestic operations were streamlined and consolidated in california  including marketing  operations  customer support  finance and product planning 
the company discontinued its japanese operations  and entered into an exclusive three year distribution agreement in japan which is expected to generate royalties in future periods 
the company s domestic affiliated label programs were terminated and the number of products being published and actively marketed was significantly reduced in order to focus the company s sales and distribution efforts 
as a result of these changes  the company has improved operating efficiencies  reduced headcount and reduced operating costs 
as a result of reducing the number of the company s products  there can be no assurance that the company s expected revenue will be sufficient to generate operating profits 
nasdaq listing 
the company was notified in february by the nasdaq stock market nasdaq that the company was no longer in compliance with the net tangible assets requirement of the national association of securities dealers bylaws for listing on the nasdaq national market 
nasdaq granted the company a temporary exemption from the net tangible assets requirement 
the exemption required that the company achieve compliance with the listing on or before july the company regained compliance with the nasdaq national market listing requirements as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended june  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the nasdaq national market in the future 
if the company is unable to maintain compliance  it may qualify for listing under the nasdaq smallcap market 
if for any reason the company is unable to achieve and maintain compliance with the smallcap listing requirements and is delisted from both the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq smallcap market  the holders of the company s convertible subordinated notes due the notes would be entitled to require the company to repurchase all or any portion of such holders notes for cash at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest 
in such event  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
volatility of price of stock and notes 
there has been a history of significant volatility in the market prices of companies engaged in the entertainment software industry  including the company 
it is likely that the market price of the company s common stock will continue to be highly volatile and the price of the company s notes will also be subject to such fluctuations 
factors such as the timing and market acceptance of new product introductions by the company  the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  loss of key personnel of the company  variations in quarterly operating results or changes in market conditions in the entertainment software industry may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock and notes 
in the past  the company has experienced fluctuations in its operating results  and it is likely that in some future quarter the company s revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of  and certain new products will not be introduced when anticipated by  public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
volatility in the price of the company s common stock  changes in prevailing interest rates and changes in perceptions of the company s creditworthiness may in the future adversely affect the price of the notes
