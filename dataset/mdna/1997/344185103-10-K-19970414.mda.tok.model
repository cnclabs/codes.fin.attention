general was a difficult year for the company 
in spite of a increase in sales to  foilmark incurred a loss of  or per share 
industry wide demand for the company s foil products were flat for most of  leading to world wide overcapacity 
this resulted in severe pricing pressures adversely impacting foilmark s revenues and margins for most of the year 
although demand for the company s foil products strengthened in the third quarter of compared to the prior six months  softness in the market appeared again in the fourth quarter and sales declined by over the comparable quarter 
for the year ended december   total foil sales were  below sales level at million  in spite of additional manufacturing capacity available for most of additionally  the delay in delivery of foilmark s new state of the art metallizer  and continuing difficulties in integrating new higher speed manufacturing equipment further contributed to the loss 
polyester film  the main component of the foil product which had increased in cost by in remained relatively constant for most of due to the over capacity in the market  it was not possible to pass along the higher polyester costs to customers 
this resulted in lower margins for most of  also contributing to the loss 
hot stamping machinery also experienced a soft market in which began in the third quarter of the decline in demand extended to specialized machines as well as standard machines and pad printing systems 
to improve profitability and efficiencies  and to better meet the changing demands of the market place in hot stamping machinery  the company announced in january the transfer of substantially all of its operations from the kensol plant in norwood  massachusetts to the imtran foilmark manufacturing facility located in newburyport  massachusetts 
the purpose of the move was to share resources  thereby reducing overhead at the imtran facility and improving margins for both the hot stamping and pad printing machinery business 
the move which was anticipated to be completed in march at a cost of  was not finalized until june 
production delays of manufactured parts associated with the move and unexpected loss of personnel not immediately replaced  continued to adversely impact sales and profitability 
machinery shipments and manufacturing efficiencies were severely affected and the vacancies in key production and support personnel were not filled until the fourth quarter 
shipments of the higher priced and higher margin credit card and label machines were especially affected by the production delays of component parts and the manufacturing inefficiencies caused by the consolidation 
this resulted in reduced gross profits 
due to a change in market conditions affecting hot stamping machinery  in december the company decided to streamline the standard product line by reducing the wide variety of models and options then presently available 
in line with this decision the company wrote off approximately  in its inventory of models that will be discontinued 
by reducing the number of models available  certain duplications will be eliminated  enabling the company to manufacture larger quantities of fewer products 
it is anticipated these actions will result in better gross margins  better efficiencies and lower inventories 
the state of the art metallizer was delivered in october  installed and tested during the balance of the year  and became operational in january this in house metallization capability for all of the foil manufacturing requirements  together with a stabilization in the price of polyester film  the main component of the company s foil products  should allow the foil product line to return to higher and more traditional profit margins in in july  the company announced receipt of a contract in excess of  to supply china north industries corp 
with equipment and technology to manufacture  convert and apply hot stamping foils and holographic products to meet the growing demand in china 
the technology was approved and transferred in december to china north industries and the equipment was shipped in the first quarter 
liquidity and capital resources on december  the company refinanced two existing mortgages  one which matured in october in the amount of  and the other in the amount of  due january to one fifteen year mortgage in the amount of  at the bank s prime interest rate or libor plus compared to prime plus 
this transaction increased the company s working capital by approximately  during the company used  of the revolving credit facility for working capital purposes and capital expenditures 
as of december  the company had  available under its revolving credit facility 
the company has historically depended upon funds generated from operations and its borrowings to provide both short and long term liquidity 
the company expects these sources of liquidity to be sufficient to supply its working capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  amounted to  compared to  for the comparable period 
the capital expenditures were incurred in connection with the relocation of facilities from norwood to newburyport and the balance of the capital expansion program which carried over into planned capital expenditures for are minimal 
as of december  the company had working capital of million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is partially attributable to the refinancing of the two mortgages over fifteen years  and to the use of the revolving credit line 
the terms of the various long term debt agreements require  among other things that the company maintain certain amounts of net worth  ratios of current assets to current liabilities  total liabilities to tangible net worth plus subordinated liabilities  and debt service coverage and restrict the amount of capital expenditures  and the payment of dividends 
at december   the company was not in compliance with certain of these covenants for which waivers were received from the lenders 
as of march   the company has amended the six million dollar  revolving credit agreement 
the amended agreement does not require principal payments prior to june  and has less restrictive financial ratio covenants than the company had prior to the amendment 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from in foil sales declined by 
million to compared to million in machinery sales increased by 
million to million compared to million 
included in the revenues were million in pad print machine sales compared to million from the company s imtran division acquired in august and not comparable for the complete year excluding imtran from sales  there would have been a decrease of the decrease in foil sales was generally due to a soft market which continued for all of in addition  foil sales suffered from the unanticipated delay in installation of a vacuum metallizer and difficulties in locating satisfactory outsourcing vendors for a portion of the company s metallizing needs until the end of the second quarter 
machinery sales  as a result of the imtran pad printing product line  increased over hot stamping machinery declined by in compared to the comparable period as a result of plant relocation and a general softness in the industry for the company s standard machine product line 
gross profit declined by  or in compared to the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to in compared to for the comparable twelve month period in gross profit in was adversely impacted by the world wide over capacity in hot stamping foils 
while at the same time  polyester film  the primary raw material in the foil manufacturing process  significantly increased in cost 
in order to maintain market share the company either reduced or did not increase prices sufficient to affect increased costs 
furthermore  margins suffered from the unanticipated delay in the installation of the metallizer  and difficulties in locating appropriate outsourcing opportunities for a portion of its metallizing needs 
in addition  manufacturing difficulties in foil production as a result of the start up of new production equipment placed in service at the end of  adversely affected efficiencies  causing a decline in gross profit 
margins in the machinery product line were adversely impacted by the relocation of the machinery manufacturing facilities from norwood to newburyport  ma 
manufacturing efficiencies suffered due to delays in the receipt of manufactured parts  which resulted in increased costs  decreased productivity and lower margins 
in addition  the company incurred approximately  in additional operating costs in connection with the relocation of the manufacturing facilities from norwood to newburyport  massachusetts  a write down of  hot stamping machinery inventory of models that will no longer be manufactured  and facility consolidation costs of  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  a increase over fiscal most of the increase was attributable to the imtran acquisition in august which was not included for eight months of the balance of the increase was due to increased amortization costs in connection with the imtran acquisition 
income from operations for the fiscal year ended december   the company incurred a loss from operations of  compared to income from operations of  for fiscal the primary reason for the decline in income from operations was the reduction in gross profit  caused by a reduction in gross profit margins to in compared to in comparable  on a increase in revenues 
additionally  the company incurred a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses due in part to the imtran acquisition without a corresponding increase in total revenues 
interest expense increased by to  up from  for year ended december  the higher interest expense was due primarily to the increase in bank debt  the proceeds of which were used to fund the expansion projects at the company s massachusetts facilities  to acquire imtran in august and to provide required working capital in settlement of litigation in connection with the personal injury claim filed against the company and described in its prior financial statement and filings was settled in april the company has accrued and is included in the financials  to cover the cost of the settlement and additional settlement costs above the insurance coverage 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  were recorded as a benefit of  at an effective rate of  as a result of a pre tax loss of  for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes was  on pre tax income of  with an effective tax rate of 
net loss 
for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to a net income of  for the comparable period 
net loss in was the result of a decline in gross profit  increased amortization costs associated with the imtran acquisition   in additional operating costs incurred in connection with consolidating machinery operations in newburyport  facility consolidation costs of  and the increased operating costs due to the plant expansion without a corresponding increase in revenues 
in addition the company has written down  in hot stamping machinery inventory of models that will no longer be manufactured 
furthermore  the company has accrued  in the net loss before benefit for income taxes as a result of the settlement in connection with the personal injury litigation filed against the company in january results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million in machine sales increased to million from million in the prior year  and foil sales increased to million from million as of december  the increase in machine sales was solely attributable to the acquisition of imtran in august whose sales contributed million 
the increase in foil sales resulted in part due to the inclusion of west foils acquired in october for a full twelve months in as compared to a three month period in  resulting in an increase of million in fiscal versus fiscal the balance of the increase was from improved market penetration in both the domestic and foreign markets 
gross profit increased to million from the fiscal level of million  a increase 
west foils contributed million and imtran contributed  or or the overall increase in gross profit 
specifically  the increase in gross profits related to increases in sales of higher margin products from the foilmark holographic images division of foilmark manufacturing and west foils 
in addition  the newly acquired imtran product line of pad printing machines and supplies provided gross margins higher than hot stamping machines and foils 
the delay in completion of the vacuum metallizer had no material effect on gross profit in selling general and administrative expenses increased million to million compared to million for fiscal for the fiscal years and expenses as a percentage of sales were and  respectively 
most of the increase in expenses was attributable to the acquisition of west foils and imtran 
as a result  the year to year figures are not comparable as west foils was only included in the last quarter of and imtran was acquired in august in addition  there were increased advertising and other associated selling costs in as the company attempted to maintain market share 
further  the company experienced in the full impact of the ancillary costs associated with being a public company 
income from operations increased by  or to million compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  income from operations increased from to 
this increase was due to the increase in foil sales on higher margin products and the acquisition of imtran offset in part  by increases in associated selling and administrative expenses 
interest expense declined to  from  for the fiscal year compared to fiscal  an decrease 
interest expense declined in part as a result of the use of the proceeds of the company s initial public offering in june to retire various long and short term bank debt as well as stockholders debt 
interest expense for the last six months of fiscal increased  over the comparable period in fiscal due to the use of various bank loans in june to fund the expansion project at the company s newburyport and norwood  massachusetts facilities and the line of credit borrowings used to acquire imtran in august and to provide working capital 
provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in the provision for taxes was due to the increased profits of the company in the effective tax rates were and respectively  in fiscal and the company s effective tax rate was lower than would otherwise be expected in fiscal as a result of the proceeds received from a life insurance policy on an executive officer of the company that was not subject to income taxes 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was attributable to both higher sales and increased gross profit 
effects of inflation during the two year period ended december  inflation did not have a significant impact on the company s operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
