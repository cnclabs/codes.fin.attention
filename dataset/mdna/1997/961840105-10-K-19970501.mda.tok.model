the dollar increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of contempo casuals and  to a significantly lesser extent  to the additional week of sales in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales as well as by the net effect of the closure of nine stores and the opening of three new stores during the company attributes the decline in comparable store sales to a lack of a significant fashion trend and to a shift in consumer discretionary spending habits  especially in the junior segment  to other non apparel items

seasonality and inflation the company s business is seasonal by nature with the christmas season beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas and the back to school season beginning the last week of july and ending the first week of september historically accounting for the largest percentage of sales volume 
in the company s three fiscal years ended february   the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of approximately of the company s annual sales  after adjusting for sales increases related to new stores
