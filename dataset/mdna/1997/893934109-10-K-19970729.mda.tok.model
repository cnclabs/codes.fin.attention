item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general transmontaigne provides a broad range of integrated transportation  terminaling  supply  distribution  gathering  processing and marketing services to producers  refiners  distributors  marketers and end users of petroleum products  natural gas and crude oil in the downstream sector of the petroleum industry 
transmontaigne is a holding company which conducts its operations through subsidiaries primarily in the mid continent and rocky mountain regions of the united states 
transmontaigne does not explore for  or produce  crude oil or natural gas  and owns no crude oil or natural gas reserves 
transmontaigne owns and operates refined petroleum product  crude oil and natural gas assets 
transmontaigne refined petroleum product and crude oil assets consist primarily of miles of pipeline and ten storage and terminal facilities in seven states with a combined tank storage capacity of approximately  barrels 
its natural gas gathering and processing assets consist of four gathering and processing systems in two states with combined throughput capacity of approximately million cubic feet per day and over  miles of pipelines 
the use of these facilities and an extensive network of additional common carrier pipelines and terminal facilities owned by others allows transmontaigne to significantly expand its geographic service area and the types of services it provides 
the principal predecessor of transmontaigne was formed in under the name of continental ozark corporation 
in april  present management and certain institutional stockholders of transmontaigne acquired control of continental ozark corporation through a merger in which the name of the corporation was changed to transmontaigne oil company 
in june  transmontaigne and a publicly held corporation merged  with the stockholders of transmontaigne receiving approximately of the stock of the merged corporation 
since transmontaigne present management assumed control in april  transmontaigne has raised approximately  in equity capital  private placement in may   private placement in march  and  public offering in february  established a  working capital and acquisition revolving bank credit facility in december which converted to the present  successor bank credit facility due december  in february  and issued  of senior notes due to an institutional lender under a  master shelf agreement in april 
management also has increased net operating margins to  and  for the fiscal years ended april  and by improving the performance of its facilities through selective capital improvements  restructured operating and administrative functions and expanded marketing of services and by implementing an operating plan together with financial management systems which provide the foundation for its current operations and future growth 
in addition  new information systems  policies  procedures and operating controls have been established  experienced managerial personnel have been added to improve operational efficiencies in all service areas and to expand the products supply and distribution and marketing functions  more effective management of inventory price risk and quantities has been implemented  and inventory carrying costs have been reduced 
in december transmontaigne acquired the grasslands natural gas gathering  processing  treating and fractionation system the grasslands facilities for approximately  in cash and through april  has invested an additional  in improvements and enhancements 
the grasslands system is one of the largest natural gas facilities in the williston basin which is currently among the most active areas of onshore domestic drilling activity 
the acquisition of the grasslands facilities is an example of the opportunities available to transmontaigne to enhance its earnings performance by capitalizing on an industry divestiture trend and applying its management capabilities in the downstream sector of the petroleum industry 
the grasslands facilities complement transmontaigne s other natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the williston basin of the rocky mountain region  and enable transmontaigne to improve service to oil and gas producers as well as to end users of natural gas liquids and natural gas 
the grasslands facilities contributed a net operating margin of  to transmontaigne during the year ended april  cautionary statement pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and may include the words or phrases believes  will depend  will become and plans to or similar expressions as well as other statements of expectations  beliefs  future strategies and comments concerning matters which are not historical facts 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements including  but not limited to  the following 
that transmontaigne will generate net margins from high sales volumes 
that transmontaigne net margins are affected by price volatility of products purchased and sold 
that  to the extent transmontaigne selectively hedges its inventory positions  those hedges are not effective 
that transmontaigne could be required to recognize a financial statement loss through a lower of cost or market write down of inventories 
that transmontaigne will incur unanticipated costs in complying with current and possibly future environmental regulations

net operating margin represents revenues less direct operating expenses for pipeline and terminal operations  revenues less cost of refined petroleum products purchased for products supply and distribution operations  and revenues less cost of natural gas gathered  processed and sold and direct operating expenses for natural gas gathering and processing operations 
natural gas gathering and processing volumes  production and revenues for the year ended april  include those items only for the period from december   the closing date of the grasslands facilities acquisition  through april  natural gas inlet volumes are expressed in thousand cubic feet  natural gas liquids ngls production is expressed in gallons  and residue natural gas production is expressed in million british thermal units 
prior to the acquisition of the grasslands facilities  transmontaigne s revenues were derived from the logistical petroleum services business segment consisting primarily of transporting refined petroleum products and to a lesser extent crude oil in pipelines  storing and terminaling refined petroleum products  and refined petroleum products supply  distribution and marketing 
gas gathering and processing services became an important business segment with the acquisition of the grasslands facilities and will have a significant impact on transmontaigne s future results of operations 
pipeline revenues are based on the volume of refined petroleum products or crude oil transported and the distance from the origin point to the delivery point 
transmontaigne interstate pipeline systems transport refined petroleum products and their tariffs are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc 
transmontaigne intrastate pipeline transports crude oil and its tariffs are not regulated by the ferc but are regulated by the texas railroad commission 
terminal revenues are based on the volume of refined petroleum products handled  generally at a standard per gallon rate 
terminal fees are not regulated 
storage fees are generally based on a per gallon rate  which varies with the duration of the storage arrangement  the refined petroleum product stored and special handling requirements 
direct operating expenses of pipelines and terminals include wages and employee benefits  utilities  communications  maintenance and repairs  property taxes  rent  insurance  vehicle expenses  environmental protection costs  materials and supplies 
products supply and distribution revenues are based on the volume of bulk sales of refined petroleum products and the wholesale distribution of refined petroleum products from terminals 
bulk purchase and sale transactions in quantities of  barrels to  barrels are common and are generally made at small margins 
wholesale distribution of refined petroleum products from proprietary and nonproprietary terminal truck loading rack locations is primarily represented by truck load sales of  gallons 
natural gas gathering and processing revenues are based on the inlet volume of natural gas purchased from producers under both percentage of proceeds and fee based arrangements 
the natural gas is gathered and processed into ngl products  principally propane  butane and natural gasoline 
these products are transported by truck or pipeline to storage facilities from which they are further transported and marketed by transmontaigne to wholesalers and end users 
residue natural gas is delivered to and marketed through connections with interstate pipelines 
direct operating expenses of natural gas gathering and processing include wages and employee benefits  utilities  maintenance and repairs  property taxes  insurance  vehicle expenses  environmental protection costs  material and supplies 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  the net operating margin from pipeline operations of  increased  or  in the current year 
this increase resulted primarily from a net increase in the volumes of higher tariff long haul pipeline shipments  based on a increase in total volumes shipped  together with increases in joint tariff participation and tankage rental income all of which resulted in a increase in revenues of  in the current year 
this increase in revenues was partially offset by a increase in operating costs of  primarily due to incremental power costs from additional long haul shipment volumes and increased field personnel costs  repairs and maintenance and property tax assessments 
the net operating margin from terminal operations of  increased  or  in the current year 
this increase resulted from an overall increase in volumes handled  primarily due to a increase at the little rock  arkansas terminal and additional volumes at the east chicago terminal facility acquired in december  offset in part by a increase in terminal operating costs attributable to the east chicago terminal  a new terminal lease  additional freight charges on products  field personnel expenses and property tax assessments 
the net operating margin from product sales in the current year of  decreased  or  net revenues increased  or  on additional volume of  gallons of products sold 
the 
net operating margin per gallon realized in the current year decreased  or  from the higher than normal 
per gallon realized during the prior year  primarily due to substantially reduced product margins realized during the second half of the current year  notwithstanding the significant increase in sales volume attributable to an expanded supply  distribution and marketing program 
the lower net operating margin was affected by generally weak market conditions 
the net operating margin was also negatively impacted during certain periods in the latter part of the current year by bulk sales of products shipped to locations on transmontaigne pipelines which resulted in minimal or negative margins 
however  these product shipments increased pipeline and terminal throughput volumes  and maximized related tariff and handling revenues 
by providing an integrated logistical service to customers through the effective utilization of both its transportation and product supply  distribution and marketing capabilities  the transmontaigne aggregate net operating margin from the logistical petroleum services business segment increased  or  over the prior year 
the net operating margin from natural gas gathering and processing operations of  in the current year is primarily attributable to the business activities of the grasslands facilities for the period from the december  acquisition closing date through april  and also includes net operating margin contributions from the marmarth and baker facilities as well as fees for the management of fifteen small natural gas gathering systems 
these were not previously sources of net operating margins since transmontaigne natural gas gathering and processing operations commenced in june the unaudited pro forma results of operations reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements include the historical operating performance of the grasslands facilities under prior ownership and are presented for comparative purposes 
included in the pro forma information are grasslands facilities revenues of  for the year ended april  representing an increase of  or  over revenues of  for the year ended april  this revenue increase was primarily due to improved product prices for ngls and residue natural gas resulting from strong wholesale demand during december and january together with a small increase in product volumes sold 
the pro forma net operating margin from grasslands facilities operations was  a increase of  for the year ended april  over the pro forma net operating margin of  for the year ended april  this increase resulted primarily from improved product prices  decreased operating expenses and the conversion of a natural gas gathering agreement from a fee based to a percentage of proceeds arrangement 
general and administrative expenses increased  a increase in the current year  primarily due to additional personnel costs and increased office lease expense together with increases in employee relocation  insurance  information systems and communication expenses  a significant portion of which expenses was attributable to transmontaigne s expanded natural gas gathering and processing business activities 
other income includes equity in earnings of affiliates and interest income 
equity in earnings of affiliates in the current year is represented by transmontaigne s share of lion s earnings  net of related minority interests  of approximately  compared to  for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to both planned and unanticipated turnaround costs major maintenance expenditures which adversely impacted earnings 
interest income in the current year increased to  from  primarily due to an increase in interest bearing cash balances held for future investments 
interest expense represents interest on the revolving and successor bank lines of credit which were used primarily to finance the grasslands facilities acquisition  other capital expenditures  inventory and accounts receivable and also includes interest on transmontaigne s senior subordinated debentures 
other financing costs include fees paid for letters of credit issued to product suppliers  loan commitment fees and debt acquisition costs paid in connection with credit facilities 
interest expense and financing costs during the current year increased  or  over the prior year 
lower interest rates in the current year were offset by the effect of a  increase in average outstanding debt 
earnings before income taxes of transmontaigne for the current year were  a increase of  over the  for the prior year 
this improvement was primarily a result of the aggregate increase in the logistical petroleum services business segment net operating margin  the positive impact of the net operating margin contribution from the gas gathering and processing business segment attributable essentially to the inclusion of over four months operations of the grasslands facilities  and additional interest income 
these increases were partially offset by increased general and administrative  depreciation and interest expenses  primarily attributable to the grasslands facilities acquisition 
as of april  management assessed the realizability of transmontaigne s deferred tax assets 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in periods when temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets become deductible 
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies are considered in making the assessment 
as a result of the grasslands acquisition in december and the public offering of common stock in february  management believes it is more likely than not that the benefits of future deductible differences will be realized and  as a result  the valuation allowance of  was reversed and recorded as an income tax benefit in the year ended april  the current year income tax benefit of  includes state tax expense of  net earnings of transmontaigne for the current year were  a increase of  over the prior year 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  the net operating margin from pipeline operations of  increased  or  in the year ended april  this increase resulted primarily from a increase in volumes shipped and increased utilization 
these increases resulted in a increase in revenues of  during the period 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a increase in operating costs of  primarily due to incremental power costs due to increased volumes  additional personnel costs and reductions in the reimbursement of certain costs previously paid by third parties 
the net operating margin from terminal operations of  increased  or  in the year ended april  this increase resulted from a increase in volumes  primarily at the little rock  arkansas terminal  offset in part by an increase in terminal operating costs of 
the net operating margin from product sales of  increased  or  in the year ended april  net revenues increased  on additional volume of  gallons sold 
the improved net margin was primarily due to increased bulk and rack product sales volumes  and higher market prices for products sold in the peak seasonal period of gasoline demand occurring in transmontaigne s fiscal quarter ended april   during which period gasoline prices reached a five year high of over 
per gallon 
the 
net operating margin per gallon realized in the year ended april  increased 
from the 
per gallon realized during the prior year  primarily due to higher than normal product margins realized during the year and significantly lower margins realized during the prior year 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately in the year ended april  primarily due to increases in salaries and related employee benefits costs associated with the hiring of additional personnel 
other income includes equity in earnings of affiliates and interest income 
in the year ended april   equity in earnings of affiliates net of the related minority interests increased to approximately  from approximately  for the prior year  primarily due to improved crack spreads at lion 
interest income of  in the year ended april   was attributable to the investment in interest bearing securities held for future investments during the period 
interest expense in the year ended april  represents interest on the revolving bank line of credit used to finance inventory and accounts receivable and also includes interest on transmontaigne s senior subordinated debentures 
financing costs include fees paid for letters of credit issued to product suppliers  loan commitment fees and debt acquisition costs paid in connection with the revolving loan facility 
interest expense and financing costs decreased  or  primarily as a result of lower average debt outstanding under the line of credit 
as a result of the increases in pipeline  terminal and products supply and distribution net operating margins  reduction in interest expense and increase in interest income  transmontaigne net earnings for the year ended april  increased  to  from a loss of  in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources the following summary reflects transmontaigne s comparative net cash flows for the years ended april   and years ended april  net cash used by operating activities    net cash used by investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    net cash used by operating activities in the year ended april  increased  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily a result of increased petroleum product inventory levels required to meet expanded levels of pipeline  terminaling and products supply and distribution operations  partially offset by increased trade payable to suppliers of inventory  and also increased trade receivables resulting from increased petroleum products sales during the year and from residue natural gas and ngls sales following the grasslands facilities acquisition in december net cash used by investing activities in the year ended april  increased  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of capital expenditures of  for additions and improvements to its terminals and pipeline facilities  including approximately  for the grasslands facilities acquisition 
capital expenditures in the year ended april  were  net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended april  increased  over the prior year period 
this increase was primarily a result of  in net proceeds received from the public offering of common stock and the  issuance of senior notes  reduced by decreased borrowings under transmontaigne s credit facilities 
ebitda represents earnings before income taxes plus interest expense and other financing costs and depreciation and amortization 
management uses ebitda as part of its overall assessment of transmontaigne performance by analyzing and comparing ebitda between reporting periods 
management believes that  in addition to cash flow from operations and net earnings as indicators of operating performance  ebitda is used increasingly by the financial community to measure operating effectiveness and as a method to evaluate the market value of companies like transmontaigne 
ebitda is also used to evaluate transmontaigne s ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures  although it is not considered in isolation or a substitute for the other measurements of performance and liquidity 
capital expenditures anticipated in the year ending april  are estimated to be approximately  for pipeline  terminal and natural gas gathering and processing facilities  including assets to support these facilities 
future capital expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the availability  economics and cost of appropriate asset acquisitions  the economics  cost and required regulatory approvals of expanding and enhancing existing systems and facilities  the demand for the services transmontaigne provides  local  state and federal governmental regulations  environmental compliance requirements  fuel conservation efforts  and the availability  to the extent required  of financing on acceptable terms 
on february   transmontaigne closed a public offering of  shares of its common stock of which  shares were issued and sold by transmontaigne and  shares were sold by certain selling stockholders 
the net proceeds to transmontaigne  based on the public offering price of per share  were  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs  of which  was used to repay a portion of the long term debt incurred under its bank credit facility 
the balance was added to working capital 
on march  the underwriters overallotment option to purchase an additional  shares and the merrill lynch growth fund antidilution right to purchase an additional  shares were both exercised and transmontaigne received additional net proceeds of  which was added to working capital 
the transmontaigne bank credit facility at april  is an  revolving credit facility with a money center bank due december  the amount available under the bank credit facility is to be reduced by  each calendar quarter beginning march  borrowings under the bank credit facility generally bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lender s announced base rate  subject to a eurodollar pricing option at transmontaigne s election 
the interest rate at april  was 
as of april   transmontaigne had advances of  outstanding under the bank credit facility and  of the facility was used to support a standby letter of credit to a bank to assist lion in obtaining financing 
in april transmontaigne entered into a master shelf agreement with an institutional lender which provides that the lender will agree to quote  from time to time  an interest rate at which the lender would be willing to purchase  on an uncommitted basis  up to  of transmontaigne s senior promissory notes which will mature in no more than years  with an average life not in excess of years 
on april   transmontaigne issued to the lender  under the master shelf agreement   of senior notes due the bank credit facility agreement and the master shelf agreement contain a negative pledge covenant by transmontaigne and its subsidiaries and are secured by the stock of the subsidiaries 
these agreements also include financial tests relating to fixed charges coverage  leverage ratio  consolidated tangible net worth  distributions and inventory positions 
as of april   transmontaigne was in compliance with all of such tests 
as of april   transmontaigne had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes which are available to offset taxable income through due to changes in ownership which occurred through april   the use of these net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income is limited to approximately  annually 
as a result of the merger in june  transmontaigne acquired additional net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  as of june   which are included in the aggregate net operating loss carryforwards  and are limited to approximately  annually 
a portion of the tax benefit of such carryforwards has been recognized as a net reduction of goodwill recorded in the acquisition 
transmontaigne had working capital of  at april  management believes transmontaigne s current working capital position  future cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the private placement or public offering of common stock  available borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility agreement and the master shelf agreement  other borrowing permitted under those agreements  and its relationship with institutional lenders and equity investors should enable it to meet its future capital requirements 
accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas was issued in february by the financial accounting standards board 
it establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps  including simplifying the standards for computing earnings per share and making them comparable to international eps standards 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods  and will not have a material effect on transmontaigne s financial statements since transmontaigne does not have a complex capital structure
