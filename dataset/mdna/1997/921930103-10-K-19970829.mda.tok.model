vdrc was merged with and into the company in august at the time of the company s initial public offering 
prior to fiscal  the company manufactured all of its footwear at two domestic manufacturing facilities located in southern california 
as part of the company s strategic redirection  in the first quarter of fiscal the company began to source from south korea its line of casual and performance footwear known as the international collection 
the success of the international collection created a domestic manufacturing overcapacity problem for the company which contributed to an overstock in domestic inventories 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company increased the inventory valuation allowance from  to approximately  in order to help mitigate the risks associated with increased inventory balances 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company took steps to adjust its us production  however  customer demand for the international collection continued to grow 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  it first became apparent that domestic manufacturing workforce reductions would not be sufficient to address the increase in orders for the international collection and the decrease in demand for domestically produced footwear  and the company determined that a plant closure would be required 
therefore  on may  the board of directors voted to close the orange facility and in july  the company closed the orange facility

management of the company  with the assistance of outside valuation consultants  calculated the amount of the orange facility goodwill based on an analysis of the company s business at the date of the acquisition 
at that time  the company s strategy was one of manufacturing efficiency  and the company s fixed assets as of the date of the acquisition were primarily deployed to manufacture footwear  and the company s chain of retail stores served as outlets for the footwear manufactured at the orange facility 
based on this analysis  and a similar analysis of the other components of the acquisition goodwill trademarks and dealer relationships  management determined that approximately of the acquisition goodwill should have been allocated to the manufacturing know how associated with the orange facility at the date of the acquisition 
the unamortized portion of the orange facility goodwill at may  was million  and was written off in connection with the closure of the orange facility

current cash position the company s cash position was million as of may   compared to million at may  the company s cash position was  in the past two years  adversely impacted by increased working capital requirements caused by the rapid sales growth of the imported international collection 
these working capital constraints  in turn  adversely impacted sales to the company s national accounts in the second half of fiscal because the company had previously committed a significant portion of its available funds to produce goods to support increased international sales which are ordered earlier in the year than production for national sales 
because the international collection is imported  there are greater timing differences between the payment for goods and the receipt of cash from sales of such goods than if produced domestically 
additionally  because payment terms in the ski and snow industry are longer than the company s traditional distribution channels  there are even greater timing differences between payment for the company s line of snowboard boots and the receipt of cash from sales of such boots 
notwithstanding the foregoing  for the next months  the company believes that cash from operations  together with borrowings from the secured line of credit which the company anticipates  but cannot assure  will be renewed as it matures  should be sufficient to meet its working capital needs 
note the previous sentence is a forward looking statement 
the company s actual results could differ materially 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include i the company s rate of growth  ii the company s product mix between the international collection  snowboard boots and domestically produced footwear  iii the company s ability to effectively manage its inventory levels  iv timing differences in payment for the company s foreign sourced product  which are discussed in the foregoing paragraph  v the increased utilization of letters of credit for purchases of foreign sourced product  and vi timing differences in payment for product which is sourced from countries which have longer shipping lead times  such as china

in fiscal  the company plans to open approximately new retail stores 
the stores will be opened throughout the year and consist primarily of outlet stores located in california and other states 
at the same time  the company will continue to identify and close under performing stores 
the company is also exploring a number of other projects which may involve capital expenditures 
while it is too early to estimate the depth  and therefore the cost of these projects  the company does not currently anticipate a significant increase in the level of capital expenditures in fiscal and estimates that these projects will be financed with internally generated funds

sfas no 
also makes a number of changes to existing disclosure requirements 
sfas no

seasonality the footwear industry is characterized by significant seasonality of net sales and results of operations 
in the past two years  the company s business has been moderately seasonal  with the largest percentage of sales realized in the first fiscal quarter june through august  the so called back to school months 
in addition  because snowboarding is a winter sport  sales of the company s snowboard boots have historically been strongest in the first and second fiscal quarters 
as the company increases its international sales through vfel and experiences changes in its product mix  it believes that future quarterly results will vary from historical trends 
in addition to seasonal fluctuations  the company s operating results fluctuate quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of holidays  weather  timing of shipments  product mix  cost of materials and the mix between wholesale and retail channels 
because of such fluctuations  the results of operations of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts
