readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the company in this report and in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect the company s business 
factors that may affect future results rapid technological change and development risks 
the company derives substantially all of its revenue from a single line of rapid thermal processing products 
the rtp industry is subject to rapid technological change  and the company and its competitors continuously seek to introduce new products that provide improved process results and manufacturing performance at prices acceptable to rtp customers 
there can be no assurance that the company can develop new products more quickly than its competitors or that the company s products will have better price performance characteristics than competitors products 
during fiscal  the company introduced its new starfire rtp system  which is intended to provide previously unavailable rtp capabilities for the 
and 
micron linewidths 
the company anticipates that production shipments of the starfire rtp system will commence in the first half of calendar in addition  the company is currently developing an rtp system for processing mm wafers 
however  there can be no assurance that production shipments of the starfire rtp system will commence on schedule or that any of the company s new products will achieve market acceptance 
semiconductor industry volatility 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and subject to unexpected periodic downturns associated with sudden changes in supply and demand 
in recent quarters  the company has experienced net sales that were significantly lower than net sales achieved in respective year ago quarters  and has incurred net losses on a quarterly basis as a result of the effects of a semiconductor equipment industry downturn  as well as the company s continuation of a high level of research and development spending on its new products and competitive pressures 
although the company s new orders and net sales are improving  which leads the company to believe it will return to profitability during the first half of fiscal  and although the semiconductor industry appears to be recovering from the current downturn  the company cannot predict the industry s cycle and its effect on the rtp market  rate of orders for the company s products or the degree to which the company s new products will achieve market acceptance 
in particular  the semiconductor industry may experience a cyclical downturn over the next few quarters as a result of economic instability in asia 
for these reasons  the company s analysts and investors expectations with respect to the company s new orders  net sales and operating results with respect to future quarters may not be met 
stock price volatility 
the company s common stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
for any given quarter  a shortfall in the company s announced revenue or earnings from the levels expected by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
the company may not learn of  nor be able to confirm  revenue or earnings shortfalls until late in the quarter or following the end of the quarter 
in general  the company participates in a very dynamic high technology industry  which can result in significant fluctuations in the company s common stock price at any time 
competition 
the company s ability to compete depends upon the company s ability to develop new rtp product features that enhance uniformity and repeatability  improve process capability and flexibility and reduce cost of ownership 
the company s competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than the company  also seek to compete in these areas  and certain competitors have introduced products that have additional functionality compared to the company s products or offer similar products to those of the company at lower prices 
in addition  the company expects to see increased competition from batch furnace vendors as those companies increased functionality available in such machines 
applied materials has made significant gains in the company s market and has offered certain functionality the company was not able to provide with it s products  allowing applied materials to capture significant customers 
applied materials and ast are significantly larger companies with greater resources than the company 
there are also larger japanese and domestic companies that possess the technical resources to enter the rtp market 
claims of patent infringement 
the company is currently involved in an intellectual property litigation 
on april   applied materials filed a complaint against the company  ast elektronik gmbh and ast elektronik usa in the united states district court for the northern district of california  san jose division 
applied materials alleges that the company s products infringe on two applied materials patents relating to rtp processes and heater head design and seeks a permanent injunction against infringement  and award of damages for infringement  treble damages for intentional and willful infringement  attorneys fees and costs of suit 
on july   the company answered applied materials complaint and counterclaimed for declaratory relief that the company s products do not infringe the patents and that the patents are invalid 
on october   the company filed a counterclaim in the united states district court for northern california  san jose division against applied materials for infringement of one of the company s rtp process patents 
on october   applied materials answered the counterclaim by alleging that it does not infringe the company s patent and that the patent is invalid 
the trial on all claims and counterclaims is set for march  management believes applied materials claims are without merit and intends to defend the company vigorously 
however  there can be no assurance that this litigation will be resolved in favor of the company  and  in any event  litigation could result in significant expense to the company and could divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from other tasks  whether or not such litigation is determined in favor of the company 
in particular  the company expects to incur significant legal expenses in fiscal in the event applied materials claims are not resolved by then 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation  the company might be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
inventory obsolescence 
because the company s industry is subject to rapid technological change  the company has experienced  and expects to experience  obsolescence of certain of its products as the company and its competitors introduce new products with improved price performance characteristics 
in particular  the company discontinued its heatpulse product line in the quarter ended march  and consequently wrote down million of inventory in that quarter 
during the quarter ended june   the company  for the first time in its history  booked more orders for its heatpulse product line than for its heatpulse product line and this trend continued in the fourth quarter of fiscal to the extent sales of new products do not offset  or generate lower margins than sales of older products  the company s business  results of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company believes that the heatpulse product line will become obsolete as acceptance of the heatpulse and starfire products increases 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received  potential cancellation or rescheduling of orders  competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to manage costs during periods of low or negative earnings growth  the availability and cost of component parts and materials from the company s suppliers  the adequate forecasting of the mix of product demand due to production lead times and capacity constraints  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  the timing and level of development costs  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  seasonal customer demand  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the impact of the company s efforts to implement its evolving long term strategy  the uncertainties of ongoing negotiations and economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas 
in addition  because of the relatively high selling prices of the company s products  a significant portion of the company s net sales in any given period is derived from the sale of a relatively small number of units  and a change  even though minor  in the number of units sold during a quarter can result in a large fluctuation in net sales for the quarter 
employee risk 
competition in recruiting personnel in the semiconductor industry is intense 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
the company believes it must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  which necessitates the continued availability of stock options and requires ongoing shareholder approval of such option programs 
year infrastructure risk 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its information technology infrastructure for the year compliance 
the company does not expect that the cost to modify its information technology infrastructure to be year compliance will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as a result of any failure by the company to be in compliance 
the company does not currently have any information concerning the year compliance status of its suppliers and customers 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers or customers does not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
years ended september  tau tau net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss less than percent tau percentages may not total due to rounding fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
substantially all net sales were derived from rtp operations for both periods 
the sales decline in the current fiscal year was primarily due to the decrease in unit sales of the company s heatpulse products  as reflected in a decrease in sales to intel  the company s largest customer in fiscal and  which accounted for million of the company s net sales in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the sales decline reflects the global semiconductor industry s slowing order rate at the end of fiscal and the beginning of fiscal and competition from two competitors with greater financial resources than the company 
sales to distributors were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the company utilizes distributors in certain geographic regions 
all of the company s sales in japan are through canon  and those in europe and korea are through metron 
sales to distributors generally result in a lower gross profit  caused by lower selling prices  which are largely offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses 
in fiscal  canon represented of net sales  compared to of net sales in fiscal  and metron represented of net sales  compared to of net sales in fiscal the decrease in sales to distributors was primarily due the decline of the global semiconductor industry s order rate at the end of fiscal and the beginning of fiscal domestic sales for the company increased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal the increase in domestic sales is primarily due increased revenues from micron 
international sales for the company decreased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
the decrease of international sales results from the decline of the global semiconductor industry s order rate at the end of fiscal and the beginning of fiscal based upon the geographic locations of semiconductor manufacturers  the company anticipates that international sales in general will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales in fiscal however  international sales as a percentage of net sales will vary on a quarterly basis depending on the impact of the economic instability in asia  the timing of orders and the relative strength of domestic sales 
international sales are typically denominated in united states dollars 
because sales of the company s products are denominated in united states dollars  fluctuations in the value of the dollar could increase or decrease the prices in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more or less expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or results of operations 
the company s end user customers include most of the leading semiconductor manufacturers worldwide 
for the year ended september   intel accounted for of total net sales and micron accounted for of total net sales 
for the year ended september   intel corporation accounted for of total net sales and nec accounted for of total net sales 
sales to ibm accounted for of total net sales for the year ended september  no other end user customer accounted for more than of the total net sales for fiscal years ended september   and the company expects increasing competition from a competitor who has substantially greater resources than the company  particularly in the sale of rtp systems designed for 
and 
micron applications and in mm and mm applications 
in addition  the company has experienced  and continues to experience  competition from other rtp equipment suppliers 
these competitors impact on future sales cannot be estimated 
as a result of competitive pressures  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its strategic customers or that such customers will not cancel  reschedule or significantly reduce the volume of orders or  in the event orders are canceled  that such orders will be replaced by other sales 
the loss of any significant end user customer  even if replaced by a different significant end user customer  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of 
however  gross profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this increase reflects the global semiconductor industry s gradual recovery over the course of fiscal gross profit decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of decreased sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to in the current fiscal year from in fiscal the reduced gross profit percentage resulted primarily from a decline in sales volume and a one time charge in the second quarter for obsolete inventory related to the heatpulse product 
as the company pursues volume production of heatpulse systems  the company expects gross margins on sales of such systems to improve 
however  attaining such improved gross margins requires the company to decrease manufacturing costs as production of heatpulse systems ramps  to increase the number of systems it produces and sells  and to keep average selling prices of heatpulse systems constant 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
research and development r d expenses decreased to million in the current fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting the company s commitment to bring new products to market and the decrease in net sales from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal year  the company announced the starfire 
micron platform for mm and mm rtp products 
because the starfire platform is not fully developed for production status  the company plans to continue to expend a significant portion of it s r d dollars on this platform in fiscal  and expects beta testing in early calendar with production in the company also expects development of mm rtp product platforms to account for a significant portion of r d expenses 
the company expects that total r d spending related to its starfire product and technology including amounts spent to date to reach million and that total r d spending related to its mm platforms and technology including amounts spent to date to reach million 
the failure of the company to timely develop new platforms  the failure of new platforms to meet customer expectations regarding performance and cost or the failure of new platforms to achieve market acceptance following product introduction would each have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company continues to believe that significant investment in r d is required to remain competitive  thought the company expects that r d as a percentage of net sales will decrease if it s sales expectations are met 
all r d costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting lower sales in the more recent period 
the decrease in absolute dollars for the current fiscal year was due primarily to the company s management of expenses in response to the decline in sales  most notably the decrease in payroll expenditures realized from the work force reduction in july  and reduced direct commissions resulting from lower net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  sg a spending in absolute dollars is expected to increase  however  actual spending may fluctuate depending on  among other things  the level of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a spending may vary from quarter to quarter 
other income expense  net was  in fiscal and  in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of lower interest income earned on the company s reduced cash and investment balances 
other income also included commissions on quartz sales of  earned in fiscal and  in fiscal equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary was million for fiscal this represents the company s share of the losses of ag associates israel ltd 
ag israel during fiscal in may  a interest in ag israel was acquired by clal electronics industries ltd 
clal electronics  and from june  to november  the company retained a interest in ag israel 
the company has accounted for its investment on the equity method since june  prior to that  ag israel was accounted for as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and its results of operations were included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in november  ag israel completed a private placement of million  in which the company did not participate 
the effect of this financing was to dilute the company s voting interest to 
additional losses from ag israel s operations will be recorded only to the extent of any future investments by the company 
for fiscal  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax expense of million in fiscal in fiscal  the effective income tax rate used to compute the company s income tax benefit was lower than the federal statutory rate due both to an increase in the company s valuation allowance as a result of management s estimate that deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be recognized and other permanent items not being deductible for tax purposes 
the company s systems backlog consisting of product scheduled for delivery within the next six months as of september  was approximately million  as compared to million at september  the increase in backlog was a result of the global semiconductor industry s gradual recovery over fiscal the company includes in its backlog customer purchase orders that have been accepted and to which shipment dates have been assigned within the next six months 
all orders are subject to cancellation or delay with limited or no penalty 
because of possible changes in the delivery schedules and additions or cancellations of orders  the company s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
substantially all net sales were derived from rtp operations for both periods 
the sales growth in the current fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in unit sales of the company s heatpulse product and included sales to one customer of million compared to million in fiscal however  sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal declined to million as compared to million in the third quarter of fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this decline reflected the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate and competitive pressures 
the average selling price of the heatpulse decreased in fiscal due primarily to an increasing proportion of distributor sales  which generally have lower selling prices than direct sales 
sales to distributors were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the company utilizes distributors in certain geographic regions 
all of the company s sales in japan are through canon  and those in europe and korea are through metron 
sales to distributors generally result in a lower gross profit  caused by lower selling prices  which are largely offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses 
in fiscal  canon represented of net sales  compared to of net sales in fiscal  and metron represented of net sales  compared to of net sales in fiscal the increase in sales to distributors was primarily due to increased international sales both in terms of actual sales and as a percent of total sales  as most international sales of the company are made through distributors 
domestic sales for the company decreased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
the decrease in domestic sales is primarily due to the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate and the loss of sales from a major customer to a competitor 
international sales for the company increased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
as a percentage of net sales  international sales increased to for the current fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
this increased percentage of international sales results primarily from substantially increased sales in terms of absolute dollars  combined with declining domestic sales in terms of absolute dollars 
the increase in absolute dollars for international sales in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales to europe and asia  including japan 
the company s end user customers include most of the world s leading semiconductor manufacturers 
for the year ended september   intel accounted for of total net sales and nec accounted for of total net sales 
for the year ended september   intel accounted for of total net sales  and ibm accounted for of total net sales 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of percent 
however  gross profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal declined to million as compared to million in the third quarter of fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this decline reflects the semiconductor industry s slowing order rate and competitive pressures 
gross profit increased from fiscal to fiscal as a result of increased sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to in the current fiscal year from in fiscal the reduced gross profit percentage resulted primarily from a decline in systems margin as the number of systems sold to distributors increased  an increase in cost incurred on systems sold in europe that required additional customization to meet more stringent european electronics regulatory standards  and an increase in overhead costs as a result of the company s move to a new facility 
this decrease in systems margin was partially offset by an improvement in spares margin 
research and development r d expenses increased to million in the current fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting the company s commitment to bring new products to market 
during fiscal year  the company introduced its heatpulse system 
the heatpulse product was a new rtp system designed for volume production environments  where process repeatability  productivity and cost are critical considerations 
this product was developed to help semiconductor manufacturers improve performance in all three areas for the full range of rtp process applications 
all r d costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting higher sales in the more recent period 
the decrease in absolute dollars for the current fiscal year was due primarily to increased sales to distributors  which have lower selling and marketing expenses than direct sales  and the company s management of expenses in response to the decline in sales during the second half of fiscal  as well as a reduction in sales commissions as a result of lower sales 
other income expense  net was  of income in fiscal and  of income in fiscal interest income net of interest expense was  in fiscal  reflecting interest earned on investment of the company s cash and investments 
other income also included commissions on quartz sales of  earned in fiscal equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary was million for fiscal this represents the company s share of the losses of ag israel during fiscal as compared to  from may through the end of fiscal for fiscal  the company recorded income tax expense of million compared to a benefit for income taxes of  in fiscal as a result of the significant increase in profitability during fiscal  the completion of the company s initial public offering and the closing of the ag israel transaction with clal electronics  the company reversed its valuation allowance for deferred income taxes  resulting in a tax benefit for fiscal in fiscal  the effective tax rate of more closely approximates the statutory rates of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the impact of ag israel losses  which are not deductible on the us federal tax return of the company  were offset in part by the tax benefits received from the company s export sales 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million as of september  and million as of september  the decrease of million from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to capital expenditures relating to the company s upgrade of it s facility to build the starfire products and to build internal starfire tools for engineering development 
the increase of million from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the company s initial public offering in may working capital decreased to million at september  from million at september  from million at september  during fiscal  the company renewed a million revolving line of credit  which is available through july  the line is collateralized by primarily all assets of the company 
borrowings bear interest at prime plus per annum when the company has a net loss and prime plus per annum when the company has net income 
there were no outstanding borrowings at september  the company s operating activities used cash of million during fiscal net loss of million  increases in accounts receivable of million and prepaids of  and decreases in accrued liabilities of  customer advances of  and income taxes payable refundable of  were offset by increases in accounts payable of million  loss on disposal of fixed assets of  and a decrease in deferred income taxes of  the increase in accounts receivable was due to increasing sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in prepaids was primarily due to the addition of an asset exchanged for services 
the decrease in customer advances was primarily due to the return of an experimental tool and subsequent refund to the customer 
the decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in the reserve for warranty parts and labor  resulting from the decrease in the number of tools under warranty coverage  and in a change in the calculation method of reserve requirements 
the decrease in deferred income taxes was due primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to an amount expected more likely than not to be recognized 
the increase in payables was primarily due to an increase in fixed asset purchases and r d spending in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the loss on disposal of fixed assets was primarily due to the decommission of engineering systems 
in addition  inventories remained constant despite a write down of million in inventory during fiscal related to the discontinuance of the heatpulse product line  as the company increased inventories during the fourth quarter of fiscal to support anticipated beta testing of its starfire products and potential net sales growth 
cash provided by operating activities was  during fiscal net income of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and losses from equity in ag israel of million were offset by increases in inventory of million along with decreases in accounts payable of million  accrued liabilities of million and refundable income taxes of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to increased collection activity and declining sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventory was primarily due to increased levels of raw materials in preparation for meeting the company s shipment targets for fiscal  as well as the stocking of offsite spares inventories 
the decrease in payables was primarily due to a decrease in purchases during the second half of fiscal the decrease in accruals was primarily due to reduced commission expense and other payroll accruals and lower level of operations during the second half of cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as net income of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  due largely to increased purchases of inventory and the growth in operating expenses  were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  reflecting an increase in net sales  an increase in inventories of million to support higher production volumes and an increase in deferred tax assets of million  principally due to increased profitability resulting in a reversal of the valuation allowance 
cash provided by used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments totaling million were the principal uses of cash in investment activities in fiscal and were offset by maturities of short term investments of million 
capital expenditures  purchases of short term investments and a required million equity investment in ag israel were the principal uses of cash in investment activities in fiscal purchases of short term investments  capital expenditures and an equity investment in ag israel were the principal uses of cash in investment activities in fiscal capital expenditures were approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company leased assets with a cost of  in fiscal  the company did not enter into any lease agreements in fiscal  the company leased assets with a cost of  in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal were made primarily to support starfire engineering and manufacturing requirements 
capital expenditures in fiscal were made primarily to support increased personnel levels and facilities upgrades 
the company relocated its entire operations from sunnyvale  california to san jose  california during october the cost of leasehold improvements for this relocation was million 
the company expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal  principally to support facilities and new product development 
financing activities provided cash of  in fiscal from the sale of common stock to employees  partially offset by the reduction in long term lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of  in fiscal primarily from the sale of common stock to employees and collections of employee notes receivable  partially offset by the reduction in long term lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal principally from net proceeds of million resulting from the company s initial public offering of common stock and short term borrowings to support the cash used by operating activities during the period partially offset by repayments of short term borrowings 
the company believes that current cash and short term investment balances  together with existing sources of liquidity  will satisfy the company s anticipated liquidity and working capital requirements through the next twelve months 
however  due to the uncertain nature of the industry  competitive market conditions and the strong commitment to developing the company s next generation products  liquidity and working capital are difficult to anticipate beyond the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  when required  will be available  or if available  can be obtained on terms satisfactory to the company 
the company reserves the right to obtain funds for working capital or other purposes
