item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  motivepower had net income of million  or cents per share  on sales of million 
during the year  the company reduced debt by million  cut general and administrative costs by million  sold million of non core assets and reduced inventories by million 
for the year  both the locomotive group and the components group had operating income above prior year results  exclusive of any unusual items 
the company s boise locomotive subsidiary completed a contract for switcher locomotives during the year  contributing significantly to the improved performance of the company 
business strategy motivepower s business strategy is to grow and continue to strengthen its core businesses 
the company considers the following to be core businesses manufacturing and distributing engineered locomotive components and parts  providing locomotive fleet maintenance and overhauling and remanufacturing locomotives  and manufacturing environmentally friendly switcher  commuter and mid range dc traction  diesel electric and liquefied natural gas locomotives up to  horsepower 
to the extent market conditions  technological developments or other factors change  management will reconsider its strategy to best position the company under the conditions and circumstances then prevailing 
industry conditions and trends the company s operating results are strongly influenced by general economic conditions  railroad freight traffic  the financial condition of the railroad industry and their outsourcing of work to improve their competitive position 
favorable conditions generally prevailed in the economy and the railroad industry during  although there is no assurance that these favorable conditions in the railroad industry will continue 
historically  however  the components and parts  maintenance and overhaul segments of the railroad industry  while still subject to the impact of rail traffic fluctuations  have been more stable and less cyclical than the new and remanufactured locomotive segments 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment  and there can be no assurance that increased rail traffic and outsourcing will benefit the company 
since the deregulation of the us railroad industry in  freight railroads have reduced their equipment base and consolidated operations to reduce operating costs and improve their competitive position compared to trucking companies  which compete with the railroad industry 
in recent years  railroads have been consolidating and merging 
management believes these consolidations offer the company opportunities to increase business with the surviving railroads as these railroads seek operating efficiencies through such means as outsourcing locomotive fleet maintenance and parts repair 
this is a forward looking statement 
there can be no assurances  however  that continued consolidation will not adversely impact the company through concentration of bargaining power over prices or rationalization of locomotive fleet sizes 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated

cost of sales exclusive of unusual items as a percentage of sales decreased to in compared to in  resulting in gross profit margins of and  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit is the result of cost reductions and improved productivity in the operating groups and increased profitability at the higher sales volume due to the benefits of operating leverage 
charges for unusual items were million in compared to million in the charges in were incurred due to the impairment of certain assets  facility rationalization and the restructuring of lease commitments 
the charges in related to the company s exit from the high horsepower locomotive business  the impairment of the mountaintop facility and the locomotive lease fleet  the disposition of the company s australian operations and other miscellaneous charges

other income of million in represents funds received on the unsecured portion of the company s restructured argentina investments 
there is no assurance that the company will receive such payments in the future 
gain on sale of assets of million in is the result of a gain on the sale of alert manufacturing and supply co 
alert of  and a gain on the sale of power parts sign co 
sign of  both companies were sold in the second half of after having been previously identified as non core assets 
the foreign exchange gain in of  compares to a foreign exchange loss of  in the respective gain and loss is the result of fluctuations in the mexican peso and its effects on the net peso exposure at the company s mexican subsidiary

the gross charge includes million paid to bank syndication partners for the break up of the existing facility and the write off of  of unamortized fees related to that facility 
the company recorded income tax expense of million in versus a benefit of million in the benefit was a result of the company s net loss during the year 
at december   mk gain had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  expiring in various amounts during  and the company had a consolidated united states federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  expiring in various amounts during the company has reflected a valuation allowance with respect to these net operating loss carryforwards of million at december  compared to sales decreased  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower sales in the locomotive group  which completed a major remanufacturing contract in february and did not secure comparable new contracts 
the components group also had lower sales due to a general slowdown in rail traffic growth for much of the year 
the decrease in sales in was partially offset by sales increases from a full year s results of operations for the company s maintenance contracts 
cost of sales exclusive of unusual items as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in resulting in a gross margin of of sales in versus in the improvement in the gross margin for was primarily a result of cost reductions in the locomotive group resulting from the decline in sales volume  and the inclusion of the operating results of mk gain for the entire year of general and administrative expenses increased  to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from expenses related to efforts to sell the company  costs associated with hiring and relocating corporate employees  and costs related to fulfilling regulatory and other requirements 
research and development expense decreased to zero in  from million in the decrease was due to the curtailment of the company s high horsepower over  horsepower locomotive manufacturing program in early interest income decreased to  in from million in the decrease was due primarily to the elimination of an intercompany receivable from morrison knudsen 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase resulted from increased borrowings under existing credit facilities needed to fund operating capital requirements and significantly higher general and administrative expenses 
the company s foreign exchange loss decreased to  in from million in the decrease is the result of the use of us dollars as the functional currency for the company s mexican operations in versus the mexican peso as the functional currency in the change in functional currency resulted from changes in the sourcing of component parts from us suppliers during the year and the us dollar denominated financing secured by mk gain in income taxes reflect a benefit of million that resulted from the company s net loss in components group compared to in  net sales for the components group decreased to million from million in the decrease is primarily attributed to the sale of alert which generated net sales of million in prior to the sale  compared to million in the full year excluding the sales of alert for both periods  net sales increased in compared to operating income exclusive of unusual items increased to million in from million in the increase is attributed to cost cutting and productivity improvements 
compared to in  net sales for the components group decreased to million from million in the decrease was due to a general slowdown in rail traffic growth for much of  which caused the railroads to defer certain maintenance costs 
operating income also decreased by to million in from million in excluding charges related to the discontinued high horsepower program  the group s operating profit would have been million in the decrease in operating income was due primarily to the group s high level of fixed costs 
locomotive group compared to in  net sales increased by to million from million in the increase is attributed to a increase in net sales at boise locomotive  primarily the result of the completion of contracts for switcher locomotives which were manufactured during the year 
six of the switcher locomotives were accelerated for delivery in  at the customer s request  to allow the units to be operating in the customer s fleet by the end of the year 
in addition  mk gain had an increase in net sales under its contract to provide locomotive operations and maintenance 
operating income increased to million in from an operating loss exclusive of unusual items of million in the increase is attributed to the increase in sales  costs reductions and improved productivity  and the accelerated delivery of switcher locomotives in compared to in  net sales for the locomotive group decreased  to million from million in the decrease was due primarily to the completion of a large remanufacturing contract  which produced sales of approximately million in and million in  which more than offset an increase in sales at mk gain 
the group had an operating loss of million in  compared to an operating loss of million in mk gain had sales of million and million  and operating income of million and million in and  respectively 
the loss included unusual items of million to discontinue manufacturing of high horsepower locomotives  and to establish reserves against the locomotive lease fleet and a manufacturing plant in mountaintop  pa 
excluding these charges and losses in the discontinued australian operations  the group would have had an operating loss of million in the comparable loss in  excluding unusual items  was million 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the company significantly improved its financial liquidity through improved operating results  an overall reduction of debt of million including the repurchase of debt the company owed to morrison knudsen  a reduction of receivables of million  a reduction of inventory of million  and the restructuring of its domestic credit facility 
in addition  the company sold non core assets during the year  including alert  sign and the majority of its locomotive lease fleet as part of the restructuring plan 
also  capital expenditures were reduced in  and certain overhead costs were reduced through work force reductions at both the operating level and the corporate level 
the following table summarizes the net changes in cash flows for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of exchange rates on cash  net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents at end of year    net cash provided by operations in was million  primarily the result of net income of million and working capital management 
during  steps were taken to return the company to profitability  including improving operations through production efficiencies and cutting overhead costs 
as a result of these actions  and significantly improved sales volume in the locomotive group  the company improved its financial condition and is positioned for future growth 
in addition  inventories were reduced by million in as the company continued to manage assets and improve liquidity 
non cash charges during the year for depreciation and amortization totaled million 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million 
as part of the company s restructuring plan  non core assets were sold during the year  generating net proceeds of million 
offsetting these proceeds were capital additions of million 
domestic capital spending during the year was limited to normal maintenance items  with mk gain expenditures being made in accordance with contractual obligations 
other investing activities provided cash of million  principally from the reduction of other long term assets 
the company anticipates a million increase in capital expenditures in  principally due to contractual obligations at mk gain and the construction of a new facility at its touchstone subsidiary 
this is a forward looking statement 
actual capital expenditures could vary based on availability of capital  interest rate increases  site availability and changes in market conditions 
cash used in financing activities in totaled million  primarily the result of the buy back of the note payable to morrison knudsen for million and the reduction of debt under credit agreements of million 
in addition  the company also used funds to buy back the preferred stock outstanding for million 
the repurchase of the morrison knudsen note was completed at a discount of approximately million  as the note plus interest at the date of closing was million 
this debt repurchase was part of the company s overall strategy of reducing debt and improving liquidity 
as a result of the improved operating results  the proceeds from the sale of non core assets and funds received from unsecured notes related to the company s restructured argentina investments  the company was able to pay down amounts owed under existing credit agreements 
also  in december  the company restructured its domestic credit facility to reduce the cost of borrowing and increase net borrowing availability through increases in the term loan portion of the facility  and mk gain entered into a new credit agreement which will provide up to million in additional financing to support investments in property  plant and equipment 
currency risks mk gain is the source of foreign currency risks 
under a contract with the mexican national railway  mk gain provides locomotive fleet maintenance and overhauls for locomotives 
for its services  mk gain receives a monthly fee paid in mexican pesos 
as currency exchange or inflation rates fluctuate  the fee is adjusted periodically currently monthly based on an escalation formula in the contract 
in  despite continued fluctuation of the peso and a high rate of mexican inflation  the formula effectively preserved the us dollar value of the monthly fee 
motivepower did  however  record a foreign currency gain of  for the year  related to mk gain s net peso exposure 
most goods and services used in maintenance and overhaul activities are invoiced in us dollars 
the company does not speculate or use derivatives in any of its investment decisions 
the company will continue to monitor its exposure to foreign currency risks and may adjust its strategy in the future 
inflation general price inflation in the united states has been moderate during the three year period ended december  and has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
some of the company s labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases  and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses which would cause the company s costs to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant 
because of the competitive nature of the company s business and its long term contract terms and conditions  it is possible that the company may be unable to pass on any significant inflationary effects to the company s customers in the form of higher prices 
the company s strategy for reducing the possible adverse effects of higher inflation is to continue to adopt methods to increase productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 
stock ownership stock ownership guidelines for the company s officers  directors and key managers  which sets minimum levels of company stock ownership as a multiple of annual salaries  have been established as of march their purpose is to encourage ownership of or more of the company s stock within five years to demonstrate an owner management commitment to increase long term stockholder value
