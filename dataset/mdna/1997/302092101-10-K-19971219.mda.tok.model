item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains certain statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future financial performance of the company 
such statements are only predictions  and the actual events or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below under business considerations as well as those discussed in other filings made by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september essentially all of the company s product sales were from the company s safhs devices 
for fiscal  product sales were million  compared with million for fiscal the increase of million or was a result of an increase in sales volume 
international product sales were of total product sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded revenues of  related to development agreements with teijin limited  a japanese corporation  compared with million in fiscal these development agreements cover two of the company s technologies i the safhs device and ii the mechanical stress device under development 
the safhs agreement provides for milestone payments to the company for teijin s development of the product for launch in japan 
the company will manufacture and supply safhs devices to teijin for clinical trials and subsequent sales in japan 
teijin is responsible for complying with the regulatory requirements and for marketing and distributing the safhs device in japan 
the mechanical stress agreement provides for milestone payments to the company that will support  in part  the company s clinical trials in the united states in exchange for a first option in favor of teijin to negotiate a development and distribution agreement for this device for the japanese market 
cost of product sales was million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal included in cost of sales were royalties and the cost of manufacture of the safhs device by the company and an outside source 
excluding revenues related to development agreements  gross profit for fiscal was million or as a percentage of product sales  compared with million or for fiscal this million increase or in gross profit was principally due to the increase in sales volume and reduced per unit product costs  partially offset by a decrease in the average realized selling price of a safhs device  which was approximately  for fiscal  compared with approximately  for fiscal the decrease in average realized selling price was primarily due to an increase in the allowances for returns and for price reductions by third party payors 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease of  or was primarily the result of i reduced expenditures for designing and building the mechanical stress device for clinical studies  ii the discontinuation of shipments of safhs devices in connection with certain clinical prescriptions for which reimbursement is currently not available  and iii reduced costs associated with analyses of clinical data for the safhs therapy 
this decrease was partially offset by increased expenses associated with additional research projects 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the million increase or resulted from i expanded selling and marketing efforts related to the safhs model a  both in the united states and in europe  and the introduction in may of the second generation safhs  in the united states  ii marketing activities relating to the company s line of synthetic casting materials used in fracture immobilization  iii increased activities relating to reimbursement efforts  and iv a nonrecurring charge of approximately  related to a workforce reduction in the third quarter of fiscal net interest income in fiscal decreased to  from million in fiscal  consistent with the level of funds available for investment 
other expense  net for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal  principally due to the settlement of a legal action by the company in the second quarter of fiscal the company incurred net losses of million  or per share  in fiscal compared with million  or per share  in fiscal per share data based upon weighted average shares outstanding  which exclude options because they are antidilutive 
the increase of  or in net loss was caused principally by the factors discussed above 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september for fiscal  product sales were million  compared with million for fiscal  which was the period in which the company first recorded sales 
international product sales were of total product sales in fiscal  there were no international product sales in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded revenues of million related to development agreements with teijin limited 
no such revenues were reported for fiscal cost of product sales was million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal included in cost of sales were royalties  the cost of manufacture of the safhs device by outside sources  and the in house cost of refurbishment and quality assurance activities 
excluding revenues related to development agreements  gross profit for was million or as a percentage of product sales  compared with  or for this million increase or in gross profit was principally due to the increase in sales volume  while the decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher warranty costs 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase of million or was primarily the result of increased staff  additional research projects  expanded efforts in designing and building the mechanical stress device  and extensive analyses of clinical data associated with the safhs therapy 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal of the million or increase  million was due to sales and marketing efforts in the united states  including expansion of the direct sales force and related commissions on sales 
the remaining million increase was primarily due to expanded activities of the company s subsidiary in germany  increased domestic expenses  including rent  utilities  and depreciation  and legal fees associated with litigation and patent matters 
net interest income in fiscal increased to million from  in fiscal  principally due to a full year s interest earned on the proceeds from the company s initial public offering ipo in july other expense  net for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal  principally due to the settlement of a legal action by the company in the second quarter of fiscal the company incurred net losses of million  or per share per share data based upon weighted average shares outstanding  which exclude options because they are antidilutive  in fiscal compared with million  or per share per share data based upon pro forma weighted average shares outstanding  in fiscal the increase of million or in net loss was caused principally by the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s expenses have significantly exceeded its revenues  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million at september  through september   the company had funded its operations primarily through the private placement of equity securities aggregating million and an ipo of common stock in july aggregating million  including proceeds from the overallotment option 
subsequent to the close of fiscal  on october   the company completed a million private placement of  shares of its common stock 
at september   the company had a working capital balance of approximately million 
in fiscal  the company used net cash of million for operating activities  primarily to fund i selling and marketing of the safhs model a and  in the second half of fiscal  the safhs and ii an increase in the international accounts receivable days outstanding from days at september   to days at september  the company s capital expenditures in fiscal were  the company estimates that equipment and furnishings to expand in house manufacturing and administrative support activities will require capital expenditures of approximately  during each of the next two fiscal years 
to help conserve its capital resources  the company reduced its workforce during the quarter ended june  through the reduction  the company expects to realize approximately  of annual pretax savings  approximately  was saved in fiscal the company plans to finance its capital needs from existing capital resources and the proceeds of the october private placement  the combination of which the company believes will be sufficient to fund its operations into fiscal additional funding might not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
recent pronouncement in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  earnings per share 
this statement establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps  replacing the presentation of currently required primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
for entities with complex capital structures  sfas requires the dual presentation of both basic eps and diluted eps on the face of the statement of operations 
under this new standard  basic eps is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding and excludes any potential dilution  diluted eps reflects potential dilution from the exercise or conversion of securities into common stock or from other contracts to issue common stock  and is similar to the currently required fully diluted eps 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods  and earlier application is not permitted 
when adopted  the company will be required to restate its eps for all prior periods presented 
the company does not expect the impact of the adoption of sfas to be material to previously reported eps 
business considerations limited operating history the company has a limited history of operations that  to date  has consisted primarily of research and development  product engineering  obtaining approval from the fda for the company s safhs device  developing the company s sales and marketing organization  supervising the manufacture of the safhs device by a contract manufacturer  developing in house manufacturing capability  and selling its safhs device domestically and internationally 
the company was formed for the purpose of acquiring the safhs technology and related clinical data  as well as the mechanical stress technology 
the company has limited direct clinical trial experience 
the company received approval of its pma application for the safhs model a device and began marketing it in october  and further received approval of the safhs device and began marketing the safhs in may  and therefore has limited experience in marketing and selling its products in commercial quantities 
the company had no previous direct manufacturing experience prior to commencing in house refurbishing of its safhs device in fiscal whether the company can successfully manage the transition to a larger scale commercial enterprise will depend  in part  upon further developing its distribution network  successfully developing its manufacturing capability  and strengthening its financial and management systems  procedures  and controls 
failure to make such a transition successfully would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
uncertainty of market potential and market acceptance the company s safhs device was approved by the fda for commercial marketing in october to treat closed  cast immobilized  fresh fractures of the tibia and distal radius within approved indications 
since that time  the company has been engaged in efforts to gain physician acceptance of the safhs device and reimbursement coverage for its use 
the market potential of the company s safhs device depends on the acceptance by the medical community of the use of ultrasound technology as a safe and effective method of treating fresh fractures and the use of the company s safhs device by physicians for treatment of these fractures 
the safhs device is based upon new technology that had not been used previously to treat bone fractures 
there can be no assurance that physicians will prescribe treatment using the safhs device 
in addition  use of the safhs device depends significantly on the availability and extent of third party reimbursement which has occurred substantially on a case by case basis  increased awareness of the effectiveness of the safhs technology  and focused sales efforts by the company 
electrical stimulation devices  the only other non invasive devices commercially available for the treatment of bone fractures  have gained only limited physician acceptance to date 
failure of the company s safhs device to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
dependence on third party reimbursement successful sales of safhs devices in the united states  europe  and other countries depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors such as managed care organizations  workers compensation insurers  private insurance plans  and government entities 
there is significant uncertainty concerning third party reimbursement for the use of any medical device incorporating new technology  such as the safhs device 
reimbursement by a third party payor may depend on a number of factors  including the payor s determination that the use of the safhs device is safe and effective  medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  cost effective  and not experimental or investigational 
in addition  devices incorporating a new technology are often prescribed by physicians for indications other than those approved by the fda off label 
reimbursement for such off label uses may not be available or permitted by government regulations 
since reimbursement approval is required from each payor individually  seeking such approvals is a time consuming and costly process that requires the company to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of the safhs device to each payor separately 
in most cases  in the united states  the company has received reimbursement approval from third party payors only on a case by case basis 
currently  third party payors that have conducted technology assessments of the safhs therapy  and have established medical guidelines for its use  require the company  in most cases  to obtain preauthorization from these third party payors prior to providing the safhs devices to the patients 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement will be sufficiently available for the safhs device or any of the company s other products that may be developed  that such third party reimbursement will be adequate  or that other third party payors  including medicare  will not recommend that the safhs device not be covered under their programs 
in august  the technology advisory committee of the health care financing administration recommended that the safhs device not be covered under the medicare program 
the company  however  continues to pursue coverage for safhs by providing additional information to the hcfa staff  in the interim  the company is not shipping orders to patients covered under medicare 
the united states congress is also considering various proposals to significantly reduce medicare and medicaid expenditures  which  if they were enacted and if safhs were covered under medicare or medicaid  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly limiting reimbursement coverage for medical devices  and in many instances have put pressure on medical suppliers to lower their prices 
the company has limited experience in obtaining reimbursement for its products in countries other than the united states  and has obtained only limited reimbursement in germany 
there is no assurance that the company s efforts to obtain reimbursement approval in germany and in other countries will be successful 
lack of or inadequate reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors for the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
history of losses  profitability uncertain  fluctuations in operating results the company has incurred substantial losses since inception and  as of september   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
such losses have resulted principally from expenses associated with obtaining fda approval for the company s safhs device  engineering and developing the safhs and mechanical stress devices  and establishing and expanding the sales and marketing organization and reimbursement activities in the united states and in europe 
the company expects to generate substantial additional losses in the future primarily attributable to development of  and clinical trials for  the mechanical stress device  clinical trials for expanded indications of the safhs technology  the continued expansion of domestic and international sales and marketing activities  and the expansion of in house manufacturing capability 
results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on such factors  and will also depend upon reimbursement by third party payors  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  timing of regulatory actions  expenditures incurred in the research and development of new products  and the mix of product sales between the united states and abroad 
the company s future revenues and profitability are critically dependent on whether it can successfully market and sell its safhs device 
there can be no assurance that significant revenues or profitability will ever be achieved 
dependence on principal product essentially all of the company s product revenues to date have been derived from sales of its safhs device 
the safhs device is expected to continue to account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s long term success will depend in part on the successful commercialization of the safhs device for its approved indications  the development and regulatory approval of safhs devices to treat additional indications  and the acceptance of the safhs treatment by the medical community and third party payors 
failure to gain market acceptance for the safhs device or to obtain adequate reimbursement coverage  among other factors  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
limited sales and marketing experience the company began marketing the safhs device in the united states in october because of limited market awareness of safhs therapy  the sales effort is a lengthy process  requiring the company to educate physicians and third party payors regarding the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of the safhs technology  to assist patients in the reimbursement process  and to provide product support to patients 
the company uses a combination of direct sales representatives and a network of independent sales representatives to market and distribute its products 
independent sales representatives typically market orthopaedic and other devices for a variety of manufacturers 
these representatives do not have prior experience in the sale or use of devices to accelerate fresh fracture healing 
there can be no assurance that these independent sales representatives will commit the necessary resources to market the safhs device effectively or that the company s direct sales staff will succeed in its efforts to promote the safhs technology to physicians and third party payors 
the company markets the safhs device in several european countries through independent distributors and sales agents  and has recorded sales in germany  austria  the netherlands  denmark  switzerland  belgium  and israel 
the company also will collaborate with marketing partners in the pacific rim to assist with regulatory requirements and to market and distribute the company s products 
the company has entered into one such agreement covering japan with teijin limited  a japanese corporation 
each of the foreign markets in which the company sells  or plans to sell  its products has its own regulatory requirements and approvals  and the distribution  price  and market structure to be established by the company might vary from country to country 
no assurance can be given that the company can successfully market the safhs device in europe or that it can secure additional marketing partners in the pacific rim on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the company s marketing success in the united states and abroad will depend on whether it can gain further regulatory approvals  successfully demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products  further develop direct sales capability to augment its existing distribution network  and establish arrangements with distributors and marketing partners 
failure by the company to successfully market its products domestically and internationally would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
risks associated with international operations the company established a subsidiary in germany during fiscal as part of its strategy to introduce the safhs device in europe  and commenced commercial distribution of the device in certain european countries during fiscal international product sales  which were principally in germany  were of total product sales in fiscal and in fiscal  and such revenues are expected to continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenues 
the company believes that its profitability and continued growth will require expansion of sales in foreign markets  and so it intends to continue to expand its operations outside the united states and enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve market acceptance of its products in international markets or maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
as of september   the balance in international accounts receivable  net of allowances for returns and bad debt  was million  with days outstanding of approximately days 
the international accounts receivable is primarily derived from sales in germany  where the company has received limited local reimbursement on a case by case basis 
to assist the collection of outstanding claims and to expedite the reimbursement process on future claims  the company is seeking nationwide approval by the national krankenkasse  the german governing organization that establishes medical reimbursement policy for health care providers 
to this end  in august the company submitted a formal application to the national krankenkasse 
the application process includes a scientific assessment and a reimbursement assessment  the company is currently in the scientific assessment phase 
in the interim  the company has elected to sell safhs devices in germany only when reimbursement is preapproved 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain a favorable ruling on its request for nationwide approval on a timely basis  if at all 
lack of approval by the national krankenkasse for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company s international product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
management can give no assurances that changes in currency and exchange rates will not materially affect the company s revenues  costs  cash flows  and business practices and plans 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  delays in receiving payments on accounts receivable balances  reimbursement approvals both government and private  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on repatriation of earnings  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurances that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international revenues and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
manufacturing and related risks the company has developed in house refurbishing capability for the safhs model a device and in house manufacturing capability for the safhs device 
in addition  the company uses a contract manufacturer to manufacture a portion of the company s safhs production 
both the company s and the contract manufacturer s respective facilities have been inspected by the fda  and have been approved for the production of the safhs under the fda s good manufacturing practices gmp requirements 
any failure by either the company or the contract manufacturer to maintain its respective facility in accordance with gmp requirements could result in the inability to manufacture the safhs device on a commercial scale  and could limit the company s ability to deliver the safhs device to physicians or patients  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
several components incorporated in the safhs device currently are  and will continue to be  manufactured by single source vendors 
for certain of these components  there are relatively few alternative sources of supply  and establishing additional or replacement suppliers for such components cannot be accomplished quickly 
any supply interruption from single source vendors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
intense competition and risks associated with rapid technological change the medical device industry is characterized by intense competition 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  and technical resources than the company and more experience in research and development  clinical trials  regulatory matters  manufacturing  and marketing 
in addition  most of these companies have established third party reimbursement for their products 
furthermore  the medical device industry is characterized by rapid product development and technological change 
the company s products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of the company s competitors or by other therapies such as drugs to treat conditions addressed by the company s products 
the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows will depend upon whether the company can compete effectively with other developers of such medical devices and therapies 
the safhs device competes with non invasive bone growth electrical stimulation devices and with various surgical treatments 
the company s mechanical stress device to prevent bone loss related to osteoporosis  if developed and marketed  will compete with drug therapies and exercise regimens 
there can be no assurance that such device will ever be developed  approved by the fda  or become commercially available 
four companies currently market electrical stimulation devices for the treatment of non union fractures fractures that remain unhealed after nine months 
the company believes that at least one of these companies is conducting clinical trials for the use of electrical stimulation for the treatment of fresh fractures 
in addition  other companies are developing a variety of products and technologies to be used in the treatment of fractures and osteoporosis  including growth factors  bone graft substitutes  and exercise physical therapy equipment 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products that are superior to the company s products  achieve greater market acceptance  or render the company s technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
as a result  the company s long term viability may depend on whether it can continue to develop new products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
extensive government regulation the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to extensive government regulation in the united states and in other countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals can be time consuming  expensive  and uncertain  frequently requiring several years from commencing clinical trials to receiving regulatory approval 
for example  the process of conducting clinical trials and obtaining the pma for the safhs model a took nine years 
the company is required to file pma supplements for new or expanded indications for its safhs technology 
in addition  modifications to its safhs devices may require pma supplements 
if a supplement were not accepted by the fda  the company would be required to undertake and complete the entire pma process in order to use future safhs devices to treat those additional indications or commercialize a modified device 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain any such approvals on a timely basis  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company filed a pma supplement for its second generation safhs  the safhs  in december  and in march  the fda approved this supplement 
in may  the company commenced commercial distribution of the safhs in the united states 
the company recently filed a pma supplement seeking approval of an expanded indication for the safhs  but withdrew that application in july to revise and resubmit it for both expanded and new applications 
the company expects to refile this supplement during the second quarter of fiscal the company will also be required to file a pma application for its mechanical stress device  if and when development is completed 
no assurance can be given that such application will be made  and if made  that a pma or a supplement to an existing pma will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
in order for the company to market the safhs device or any future products in foreign jurisdictions  it will be required to seek regulatory approvals in those jurisdictions 
no assurance can be given that the company can obtain required regulatory approvals in foreign countries on a timely basis  or at all 
regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
fda enforcement policy strictly prohibits the promotion by the company and any of its distributors of approved medical devices for off label uses 
there can be no assurance that the company will not become subject to fda actions as a result of physicians prescribing the safhs device for off label uses 
in addition  product approvals may be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing 
the company is required to adhere to fda regulations setting forth gmp requirements relating to tests  control  and documentation 
ongoing compliance with gmp and other applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by state and federal agencies  including the fda  and by comparable agencies in other countries 
failure to comply with applicable united states and international regulatory requirements can result in failure of the relevant government agency to grant pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approval  total or partial suspension of production  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations or policies could prevent the company from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals or clearances 
during  the company received regulatory approval of the safhs model a in germany 
under german law  medical devices must have a gs mark affixed to the product labeling 
the gs mark  which the company received in december  denotes that the product meets certain safety standards 
in  the company also received the ce medical device directive mark for the safhs model a 
the ce mark is recognized by countries that are members of the european union and the european free trade association  and effective june  will be required to be affixed to all medical devices sold in the european union 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances in the united states  europe  the pacific rim  or elsewhere on a timely basis  or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
limited protection of patents  copyrights and proprietary rights  risk of patent infringement the company relies on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  and confidentiality agreements to protect its proprietary technology  rights  and know how 
no assurance can be given that the company s patent applications will issue as patents or that any issued patents owned by the company will provide competitive advantages for the company s products or will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
under current law  patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents are issued  and patent applications in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
the right to a device patent in the united states is attributable to the first to invent the device  not the first to file a patent application 
accordingly  the company cannot be sure that its products or technologies do not infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent applications or that its products do not infringe any patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from selling its products or could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of such patents or be required to redesign its products to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be on terms acceptable to the company  or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
the company s failure to obtain these licenses or to redesign its products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary information  and enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants  and advisors 
there can be no assurance that the obligations to maintain the confidentiality of such trade secrets and proprietary information will effectively prevent disclosure of the company s confidential information or provide meaningful protection for the company s confidential information if there is unauthorized use or disclosure  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by the company s competitors 
the company also holds rights to copyrights on text and on software developed by or for itself for use in its safhs device 
there can be no assurance that any copyrights owned by the company will provide competitive advantages for the company s products or will not be challenged or circumvented by its competitors 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement  to enforce patents and copyrights issued or licensed to the company  or to protect trade secrets  and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any such litigation 
uncertainty of new product development the company plans to seek fda approval to commence clinical trials in the near future to expand the approved indications for the safhs technology to include other fractures  spine fusion  and cartilage repair 
in addition  the company has developed a mechanical stress device to prevent bone loss related to osteoporosis 
the company has commenced a pilot clinical trial in the united states  and anticipates that it will be required to undertake additional development activities and human clinical trials before seeking regulatory approval for this device 
there can be no assurance that the mechanical stress device will prove to be safe and efficacious  that product development will ever be successfully completed  that a pma  if applied for  will be granted by the fda on a timely basis  or at all  that adequate levels of third party reimbursement will be available  or that the mechanical stress device will ever achieve commercial acceptance 
the company s inability to show efficacy in additional applications of its safhs technology  to successfully develop the mechanical stress device  or to achieve market acceptance of such new applications and products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
royalty payment obligations  potential loss of exclusive license the company is required to pay a royalty on any net revenues from sales of the mechanical stress device  if such device is successfully developed 
in the event that the company does not commercially exploit the underlying technology as required by the license agreement for such technology  the company will forfeit its exclusive license to the mechanical stress technology 
there can be no assurance that the company will commercially exploit such technology within the meaning of such license  and forfeiture of such exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
product liability and insurance the company faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
there can be no assurance that liability claims will not exceed the coverage limits of the company s insurance policies or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
consequently  product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
reliance on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company also believes that its future success will depend in large part on whether it can attract and retain highly skilled technical  management  sales and marketing  and reimbursement personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the company s failure to attract  hire  and retain these personnel would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
possible volatility of stock price the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in earning estimates by analysts  general conditions in the medical device industry  and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar or related to that of the company and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
certain anti takeover provisions the company s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock of the company  par value per share the preferred stock  in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions thereof  including dividend rights  dividend rates  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  redemption prices  liquidation preferences  and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series  without further vote or action by the stockholders 
effective december   pursuant to the rights agreement  the company s board of directors declared a dividend of one right to purchase  under certain circumstances  one one hundredth share of the company s series a preferred stock for each outstanding share of common stock of the company 
although the company has no present plans to issue any additional shares of preferred stock  it may do so in the future 
see part ii  item  market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters the stockholder rights plan  and the copy of the rights agreement attached as exhibit to the company s form k for the year ended september   for more information relating to the stockholder rights plan 
the company s bylaws specify procedures for director nominations by stockholders and the submission of other proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings 
certain provisions of delaware law applicable to the company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving the company  including section  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock including pursuant to the rights plan  the procedures required for director nominations and stockholder proposals  and delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of the company  including without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the company s common stock  or limiting the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock
