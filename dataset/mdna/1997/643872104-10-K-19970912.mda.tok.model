in general  the company anticipates being able to offset inflationary cost increases in business form products with cost reduction initiatives and price increases during fiscal year however  the company s cost of sales as a percentage of sales for fiscal year is expected to increase by more than two percentage points due to an increase in revenue contribution from the lower margin products associated with the recently acquired businesses 
selling and advertising expenses decreased from of sales in to of sales in this decrease was principally the result of the company s decision to exit the kinko s retail channel initiative early in fiscal  which substantially reduced selling and advertising expenditures  as well as the sale of the one write plus r software line in late fiscal  which also required a high level of selling and advertising support 
these reductions were partially offset by increased direct mail advertising required to increase revenue growth rates in the direct mail forms business

the words or phrases is expected  will continue  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions in any of these communications are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and section a of the securities act of  as enacted by the private securities litigation reform act of there can be no assurance the company s actual performance will not differ materially from that projected in such forward looking statements due to the important factors described below 
these factors include increasing competition  economic cycles  technological change  paper and postal costs  customer preferences  response rates  prospect lists  governmental regulations  inherent risks in acquisitions  disruptions to the company s operating systems and reliance on vendors  all of which are described in further detail below 
increasing competition  pressure on price and margins the company operates in a highly competitive marketplace  in which it competes with a variety of mail order marketers  retailers  dealers  distributors and local printers in the marketing of business forms  stationery and supplies to small businesses 
over the course of the past decade  mail order providers of business forms and stationery have experienced growth in excess manufacturing capacity 
in addition  the company has faced increasing competition from low price  high volume office supply chain stores 
improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology have increasingly allowed dealers  distributors and local printers to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive prices 
the company currently anticipates that these trends will continue 
no assurance may be given that competition will not have an adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  if any of the company s mail order competitors were to seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices or increasing promotional discounting  the company would be compelled to reduce its prices or match the discounts and thereby reduce its gross margin and profitability 
economic cycles  variability of performance 
the company s standardized forms and check business accounts for a large majority of its sales and profitability 
the forms and check industry is highly competitive and generally characterized by mature products designed within well established industry standards 
the company relies  in part  on net small business formations for growth in demand for its standardized form and check products 
as a result  the company s growth rate is closely correlated to the strength of its target small business market 
the company s revenue trends and operating profitability have been materially adversely affected by recession related contractions in the small business economy in the past 
the company will continue to experience quarterly and annual variations in net sales and net income as a result of changes in the levels of small business formations and failures or from other economic events having an impact on small businesses generally 
technological change  product obsolescence and risks to competitive advantage 
the company s standardized business forms and related products are designed to provide small businesses with the financial and business records required to manage a business 
steady technological improvements have provided small businesses in several market segments with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
pc based  point of sale  electronic form and electronic transaction systems have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by the company s products 
the price and performance characteristics of personal laser and ink jet printing equipment have improved markedly in the recent past  thereby allowing small businesses a cost competitive means to print low quality versions of company forms on plain paper 
in addition  the internet has the potential to eliminate the company s advantage of scale in direct marketing by providing all competitors with equal access to customers who purchase products over the internet 
in response  the company has focused resources on the acquisition  development and procurement of new products less susceptible to technological obsolescence and has aggressively moved to develop a comprehensive electronic catalog of products to be utilized in retail based kiosks  pc based software and over the internet 
it should be noted that the company s small business customers have proven to be relatively slow adapters of new technology which has minimized the adverse impact of these technological trends 
however  the company may give no assurance that continued technological change will not have a material adverse impact on the long term prospects for the company s business 
paper costs and postal rates  risks to margins 
the cost of paper used to produce the company s products  catalogs and advertising materials constitutes  directly or indirectly  approximately of consolidated revenues 
in addition  the company is reliant on the us postal service for delivery of most of the company s promotional materials 
coated paper costs for promotional materials and postal rates for third class mail have increased significantly over the past decade 
in addition  certain segments of the paper market have demonstrated considerable price volatility over the past five years 
the company has been able to counteract the impact of postal and paper cost increases with cost reduction programs and selected product price increases 
due to increased competition in the small business forms  stationery and supplies marketplace  no assurance may be given that the company will be able to increase product pricing to compensate for future paper or postal cost increases 
the inability to raise prices in response to paper or postal cost increases could reduce the company s operating profitability and net income 
customer preferences  investment requirements sales risk 
the company s core competency is the direct marketing  manufacturing and distribution of standardized forms and related products to small businesses 
newly formed small business owners are increasingly demanding custom and color coordinated products to create an image in addition to enabling the management of business transactions 
the relative prices charged by local printers  contract printers and dealers for providing these custom and full color printed products have been declining due to technological advances in composition systems and printing equipment 
as a direct result  the cost advantage inherent to the company s standardized forms and related printed products has declined 
the company is responding with focused investment in the infrastructure required to sell  compose  print and distribute custom and full color products 
this effort will include installation of an integrated and flexible information system architecture and the re engineering of many of the company s basic business functions 
in addition  the company will continue to invest in its dealer and technology based channels that more readily support the interactive marketing required to sell custom and full color products 
however  the company can give no assurance that the rate of decline in demand for standardized forms and related printed products will not accelerate  that the interactive marketing investments will prove successful  or that the information systems re engineering effort will not result in operating inefficiencies or unplanned expense 
if any of such potential risks materialize  the company s future net sales and net income could be materially adversely affected 
response rates and customer retention  sales risk 
customer and prospect response rates to the company s catalogs and promotional materials have remained relatively stable over time 
continued stability in prospect response and customer retention is primarily dependent on the continued relevancy of the range of the company s products to the small business marketplace 
new product introductions  to date  have generally offset declines in response rates and retention attributable to product obsolescence 
however  the company can make no assurances that its new product introductions will continue to offset the rate of obsolescence of its standardized forms products in the future 
an increase in the rate of product obsolescence or a decline in new product introductions could negatively impact response rates and customer retention which  in turn  would have a materially adverse impact on the company s long term financial performance 
prospect lists  sales risk 
the company s direct mail business has been characterized by a consistent level of average annual sales per customer 
as such  net sales growth is dependent  in part  on an increase in customers served by the company 
growth in the total number of direct mail customers served by the company depends upon continued access to high quality lists of newly formed small businesses 
in the past  the company s ability to compile proprietary prospect lists was a distinct competitive advantage 
however  the external list compilation industry has grown more sophisticated and currently markets comprehensive lists of newly formed businesses to the company and its competitors 
at present  the company relies on the speed of its delivery of promotional materials to prospective customers to gain advantage over competitors 
however  the company can make no assurances that its promotional material delivery advantage will be maintained over time 
a deterioration in the company s delivery advantage could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business and financial performance 
governmental regulations  sales risk 
future governmental legislation or regulation including  but not limited to  the following potential regulatory actions have the potential to have a material adverse impact on the company s business prospects institution of privacy laws could constrain the company s ability to mail promotional materials or to telemarket to small businesses  modification to us postal service regulations with the effect of increasing postal rates or reducing postal delivery efficiency could have an adverse impact on the company s marketing efforts  and institution of a general sales tax  value added tax or similar national tax could reduce demand for the company s products 
although the company has no current knowledge or belief that such adverse regulation  or similar governmental regulation is pending or imminent  it may make no assurance that adverse governmental regulation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business in the future 
acquisitions  inherent risk 
from time to time the company has acquired  or may acquire in the future  a majority ownership position in a company or substantially all of the assets related to a specific line of business 
during fiscal year  the company acquired standard forms limited and the assets of chiswick trading  inc which  in the aggregate are anticipated to comprise approximately of the company s future consolidated revenues 
such acquisitions are undertaken to enhance the company s competitive position in the marketplace or to gain access to new markets  products  competencies or technologies 
the company has performed in the past and will perform in the future a business  financial and legal due diligence review in advance of an acquisition to corroborate the assumptions critical to projected future performance of an acquired entity and to identify the risks inherent to such projections 
however  the company can make no assurances that its due diligence review will identify all potential risks associated with the purchase  integration or operation of any acquired enterprise 
if any of such potential risks materialize  the company s future net sales and net income could be materially adversely affected 
operating systems  disasters and disruptions 
the company has become increasingly dependent upon its manufacturing  administrative and computer processing infrastructure and operations to process its high volume of small dollar value orders on an efficient  cost competitive and profitable basis 
the company has implemented commercially reasonable safeguards to reduce the likelihood of property loss or service disruptions and has secured property and business interruption insurance to minimize the adverse financial consequences arising from a select group of risks 
however  the company can make no assurances that its infrastructure and operations are not susceptible to loss or disruption  whether caused by i intentional or unintentional acts of company personnel or third party service providers  or ii natural disasters including  but not limited to  earthquakes  fire or severe storms 
in addition  the company can make no assurance that its insurance coverage will adequately respond to all potential causes of property loss or service disruption 
in the event that any such acts or disasters lead to property loss or operating system disruption for which property and business interruption insurance coverage is unavailable or insufficient  the company s financial performance and long term prospects could be materially adversely affected 
raw materials and services  reliance on certain vendors the company has become increasingly reliant on certain individual third party vendors to provide raw materials and services critical to the company s operations in order to gain the advantage of volume related favorable pricing and  in some instances  favorable contract terms 
such critical vendors and the nature of the products or services provided include  but are not limited to  the united states postal service for the delivery of marketing materials  mci telecommunications corporation for the provision of toll free telephone services  rr donnelley and sons  inc for printing and processing of marketing materials  appleton papers  inc for carbonless paper  and united parcel service of america  inc for product delivery services 
in the past  the company has been adversely affected by disruption in the services provided or lack of availability of the products produced by its critical vendors resulting from a variety of factors including labor actions  inclement weather  disasters  systems failures and market conditions 
the company can make no assurance that its critical vendors will remain capable of providing the level of service or quantity of product required to support the company s business  nor that the company could immediately identify alternative sources for provision of the product or service on a similar cost basis 
any such service disruption or product shortage could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating performance and net income 
other risks  variability of performance 
the company has experienced in the past and will experience in the future quarterly and annual variations in net sales and net income as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  the timing of catalog mailings  catalog response rates  product mix  the timing and levels of selling  general and administrative expenses  cost reduction programs  timing of holidays and inclement weather 
the company s planned operating expenses are based on sales forecasts 
if net sales performance falls below expectations in any given quarter or year  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected
