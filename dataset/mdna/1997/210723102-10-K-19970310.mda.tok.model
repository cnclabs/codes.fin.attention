item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis sets forth certain factors relative to the company s financial condition at december  and the results of its operations for the three years ended december  liquidity and capital resources construction program capital construction expenditures in totaled million  net of contributions and advances  substantially all of which relates to the company s utility subsidiaries 
projects include million spent on a new water treatment plant expansion in ohio  which cost million in total  and many smaller projects throughout the company 
the company expects capital expenditures for through to be million  net of contributions and advances 
the capital construction budget is down from its peak of million for the planning period as a result of the completion of many of the improvements required by the safe drinking water act sdwa  the clean water act cwa  and other regulations 
with the reduced capital spending due to regulatory requirements  the company has increased its focus on replacing aging infrastructure 
the company has also started planning a major plant upgrade at consumers pennsylvania water company shenango valley division 
this project is expected to cost approximately million when it is completed in this upgrade of one of the company s older water treatment plants is required to keep it in compliance with current and future regulations and to meet expected increases in demand 
the project is still in the planning stage 
several design and financing alternatives for this project are still being explored 
several of the company s water utility subsidiaries have filed or plan to file rate cases in their respective jurisdictions for recovery of and return on capital used to fund their capital expenditure programs 
costs which have been prudently incurred in the judgement of the appropriate public utility commission have been  and are expected to continue to be  recognized in rate setting 
given the large rate increases in recent years  management expects the current increased scrutiny of rate requests by state public utility commissions to continue even with decreasing capital construction budgets 
financing and capitalization the table below shows the cash generated and used by the company during cash was generated from dollars in millions operations long term debt issued common stock issued proceeds from sale of properties 
net borrowings of short term debt total cash generated cash was used for capital expenditures  net of ciac repayment of long term debt 
payment of dividends increase in restricted funds cost of acquisition other total cash used decrease in cash 
water utilities now require higher equity ratios than in the past to maintain favorable debt ratings due to the recognition by standard poor s rating system of additional risk of the sdwa requirements and the uncertainty of future regulatory treatment of the cost of these requirements 
this  coupled with the size of the company s capital expenditure program  makes it likely that the company will return to the equity market again in the next few years 
the company anticipates continuing to fund its immediate cash flow needs with short term lines of credit until a subsidiary s short term debt level is high enough to warrant placement of long term debt  generally  in the million range 
the company s subsidiaries had unused lines of credit available at december  of million 
in addition the company has two revolving credit agreements totaling million 
these agreements were renewed during the third quarter and are now committed until mid the company also anticipates receiving a committment for an additional million revolving credit agreement in early at december   million was outstanding on these agreements  which is recorded as long term debt on the balance sheet 
these borrowings were used primarily to provide equity infusions to the subsidiaries 
in addition  the company is using funds generated through its dividend reinvestment program 
the dividend reinvestment program generated million in new equity in in addition to short term debt  the company s water utility subsidiaries plan to continue to use tax exempt  long term debt financing in appropriate situations 
retained earnings declined by million in as a result of payments of dividends in excess of earnings 
given the seasonality of the business and the continuation of the current dividend  it is likely that retained earnings will decline further at least through the first quarter of acquisitions and dispositions over the past five years  the company has acquired nine water systems including three small systems in two of the systems are located in maine and have  customers in the aggregate 
the other is located in pennsylvania and has  customers 
management anticipates continuing the acquisition policy of recent years 
the company has sold five divisions with customers totaling approximately  under the threat of eminent domain since the gain on these sales totaled over million 
the town of hudson  new hampshire  has initiated eminent domain proceedings to acquire the distribution system assets of consumers new hampshire water company  which are located in hudson 
the town of hudson must get approval from the new hampshire public utilities commission 
the ultimate resolution of these proceedings is unknown 
approximately  of consumers new hampshire s  customers are located in hudson 
the company continues to work with the local communities in its service areas in an effort to prevent future eminent domain proceedings 
other in march   an outside contractor spilled a small amount of mercury while working at consumers ohio s water treatment plant 
several areas in and around the plant were contaminated by the spill  although no mercury contaminated consumers ohio s water supply 
the cleanup has been completed at a total cost of approximately  consumers ohio has received  from its insurer and had sought recovery of all the cleanup costs from the contractor 
management believed it possible that consumers ohio would recover cleanup costs from the contractor and or the contractor s insurer and  therefore  deferred the costs incurred in connection with the spill 
however  due to the progress of the case and to the expected cost of the litigation  consumers ohio reserved  in for possible losses on this claim 
in november   the contractor obtained a judgement in its favor  from which consumers ohio has appealed 
as a result of this adverse judgement  consumers ohio increased the reserve previously taken to cover the clean up and legal costs by  or  net of taxes 
in  the company s subsidiary  consumers maine water company consumers maine  started construction of a trasmission main to fish and hobbs ponds  which are located in hope  maine  to increase the available water supply of its camden and rockland division

the maine public utilities commission mpuc ordered consumers maine to defer the costs of the project  the legal costs of defending the water rights and carrying costs until its first rate case after june  consumers maine currently has  on its balance sheet related to this project 
consumers maine expects to file a rate case with the mpuc in seeking recovery of these costs

the reduced consumption is due to a wet compared to a dry and reduced industrial usage
