for the first time in the united kingdom  the telegraph solicited direct prepaid subscriptions from potential readers 
in the past  newspaper subscribers have dealt directly with independent news agents for the purchase of newspapers 
these agents deal in numerous publications 
a significant portion of the newspaper readers did not take the paper every day and this has been especially true for sunday 
starting in the late summer the telegraph began a direct mail campaign to solicit prepaid seven day a week subscriptions 
these were offered for   and week periods 
by year end  the plan had added about  new weekday and  new sunday average sales 
the average prepaid subscription was for a period of about weeks 
in order to gain broad acceptance of this revolutionary plan  the subscriptions were offered at a significant discount

the cover price of the saturday edition  the daily telegraph s highest circulation day  was left unaltered at p without loss of circulation
