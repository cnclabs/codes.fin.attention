item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the industry the property and casualty insurance industry s profitability may be affected significantly by the availability of insurance coverage  which varies according to levels of surplus in the industry  volatile and unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  blizzards  fires and explosions  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of insurance companies investments and the income from those investments  inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses and judicial  legislative and regulatory decisions affecting insurers liabilities 
the demand for property and casualty insurance can also vary significantly  generally rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as such activity decreases 
price competition has also been enhanced by a flight of commercial insureds to alternative risk mechanisms  often including a degree of self insurance 
the industry has experienced the effects of a number of well publicized catastrophic events in recent years  some of which have affected the company primarily through its curtailed assumed reinsurance operations 
growth in liabilities related to asbestos and environmental risks has also adversely affected the industry and are of significance to the company

property and casualty insurers are regulated by the various state insurance departments that coordinate their efforts through the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
regulation includes rate and policy form approval  licensing of insurance agents and companies and solvency oversight 
as a result of recent legislative changes in the texas insurance market  beginning with senate bill aimed at workers compensation reform  which became effective january   the texas insurance climate has become more attractive to insurers 
discontinued lines for reporting purposes  the company has three lines of business which are considered discontinued lines i business originated by the company s london reinsurance operations highlands uk  ii an umbrella excess liability policy program and iii assumed casualty and property reinsurance contracts 
the company has ceased to write these discontinued lines 
although the company has discontinued other lines of business  primarily its florida and texas personal lines and probate bonding business  the company has included the financial results of those lines in underwriting results excluding discontinued lines for consistency purposes 
the discontinued lines percentage of gross premiums written to the company totals for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively  while the percentage of underwriting losses to the company totals for the same time periods were  and  respectively 
london originated business 
the company participated in the london insurance markets from until through a branch office in london the highlands london branch 
the primary business of the highlands london branch was the direct writing and reinsurance of general liability risks for insureds in the united states and london market marine and aviation risks 
the highlands london branch ceased doing business in the united kingdom when highlands uk was formed in in order to withdraw from direct writing of marine and aviation risks and significantly reduce the direct writing and reinsurance of us general liability risks in the london market 
highlands uk served as an insurer and reinsurer in london markets primarily by participating in excess of loss reinsurance liability policies  which included coverage for catastrophe losses of customers in excess of policy limits of other applicable policies 
highlands uk ceased writing new policies in early accordingly  the company s continuing exposure on the business of the highlands london branch is generally attributable to adverse loss reserve development on asbestos and environmental claims  whereas the ongoing exposure of highlands uk is primarily related to adverse loss reserve development on the high levels and severity of catastrophe claims such as the piper alpha explosion  the exxon valdez oil spill and hurricane hugo that have occurred since and have been slow to emerge in the london market 
umbrella excess liability program 
beginning in the early s  highlands wrote policies that provided the customer with umbrella and excess liability coverage with respect to losses which exceeded another insurer s primary and excess policy coverages 
the threshold at which coverage commenced under such policies underwritten by the company varied from  to million and above 
the limits of coverage under the company s excess liability policies were generally up to million in excess of underlying policies and the company generally limited its exposure through substantial reinsurance 
the program was canceled and underwriting operations ceased effective december  the company s adverse loss experience on these policies has primarily emanated from asbestos and environmental pollution claims 
assumed casualty and property reinsurance 
highlands participated in approximately assumed casualty reinsurance agreements per year primarily written from through as an excess of loss reinsurer with participation percentages that varied from contract to contract 
a majority of assumed casualty treaties were nonrenewed by the end of all remaining casualty contracts were canceled by december  the company participated at levels of  to  per contract on hundreds of assumed property reinsurance contracts per year from through loss development on the assumed casualty treaties has primarily emanated from product liability  asbestos and environmental pollution liability  particularly for accident years through development on the assumed property reinsurance agreements has primarily related to catastrophe exposures 
for and prior periods  highlands was a direct writer of florida commercial and personal homeowners lines and acted as a fronting company for the southern underwriters inc quota share facility the southern underwriters facility  which reinsured substantially all of this risk 
due to highlands participation approximately as a reinsurer of the southern underwriters facility  this business was managed as and included with the assumed property reinsurance business 
subsequent to the termination of the southern underwriters facility in  the company s florida direct business has been and will continue to be managed as and included with the assumed property reinsurance business 
in  as permitted by the laws of the state of florida  the company ceased writing the florida personal homeowners line of business

the decrease of million or in is attributable to several factors 
the company began its underwriting initiatives in march and continues to focus on stricter underwriting standards and price increases both of which have contributed to declines in gross premiums written 
also contributing to declines in gross premiums written is the highly competitive market conditions for special accounts customers 
in this highly competitive market  special accounts has become more selective in its initial underwriting as well as renewal activity 
finally  insurance services mix of business continues to change from retrospectively rated policies to high deductible policies which produce lower gross premiums 
gross written premiums written for were negatively impacted by a reduction of million of accrued premium adjustments and million of improperly classified accrued premiums on retrospectively rated policies 
gross premiums written for were also impacted by the decision to exit the probate bonding business 
on march   the company reinsured of its inforce policies  subject to a profit sharing arrangement 
the year ended december  includes million of probate bonding gross premiums written compared to million for the comparable period 
the decrease in probate bonding gross premiums written is expected to continue in gross premiums written for retrospectively rated policies may be adjusted up or down  subject to certain limitations contained in the policy  based on the estimated loss experience of the insured during the policy period 
the company estimates ultimate losses for retrospectively rated policies and then adjusts gross premiums written and premiums due from policyholders under retrospectively rated policies for changes in the estimated ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense from the date of the prior valuation 
these adjustments may cause gross premiums written to fluctuate significantly from period to period

the company implemented a plan under which it recorded a million restructuring charge as part of its strategic and financial assessment of the company s business 
additionally  a charge of million was recorded for underaccrued premium taxes

see loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and third quarter charge environmental reserves including asbestos below 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves underwriting results of the property and casualty industry are significantly influenced by estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
these reserves are an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to settle and pay all outstanding and unreported claims including loss adjustment expenses  net of estimated claim recoveries 
the case reserve estimates for reported claims are based upon the facts of each case and the company s experience with similar cases 
consideration is given to historical trends regarding reserving patterns  loss payments  and the effects of court decisions  economic conditions and public attitudes 
the process of establishing reserves is an imprecise science involving significant judgment and assumptions 
as information develops that varies from experience  provides additional data or  in some cases  augments data that previously was not considered sufficient for use in determining reserves  changes in the company s estimate of ultimate liabilities may be required 
changes in prior year reserve estimates net of reinsurance  which may be material  are reflected in the results of operations in the period such changes are determined to be required 
during the last several years  the company has experienced significant adverse development on prior year net ultimate loss estimates 
the following table sets forth the amount of the adverse development split between lines other than discontinued lines and discontinued lines for the periods indicated 
year ended december  dollars in millions net reserve re estimates due to lines other than discontinued lines asbestos and environmental all other discontinued lines asbestos and environmental highlands uk primarily catastrophes all other net adverse development as a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years  primarily asbestos and environmental claims as well as catastrophe claims  the provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred net of reinsurance recoveries of million  million and million for  and  respectively increased by million in  million in and million in the emergence of environmental and asbestos claims over the last few years and the difficulty in accurately estimating the necessary reserves have significantly contributed to the company s loss reserve development over this period 
for additional details regarding environmental claims emergence and reserves  see third quarter charge environmental reserves including asbestos 
the company s exposure to future catastrophe claims has been significantly reduced as a result of curtailing the company s cessation of its highlands uk business 
for the year ended december   the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were reviewed by external independent actuaries in order to establish the company s reserve position 
third quarter charge in the third quarter of  the company and its external actuaries conducted a review of its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to assess the company s reserve position 
as a result of such review  the company recorded a charge to pre tax earnings during the nine months ended september  of million 
of this amount  million related to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves million before deducting reinsurance and million represents an increase in reserves related to litigation proceedings against the company 
of the million amount for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  adjustments of risks arising from i environmental claims constitute million million before deducting reinsurance  ii assumed reinsurance claims constitute million million before deducting reinsurance  and iii increased losses from catastrophes reinsured by highlands uk constitute million million before deducting reinsurance 
an additional million million before deducting reinsurance was added to unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves to reflect additional costs related to the settlement of claims and run off costs related to highlands uk  and the remaining million million before deducting reinsurance reflects changes to reserves for unreported losses in order to reflect the current evaluation of overall loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
each of these is discussed in more detail below 
environmental reserves including asbestos 
approximately million of the increase in the net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves million before deducting reinsurance of the company is related to increased provisions for environmental claims including asbestos claims 
environmental claims for this purpose are those claims arising from long term and other exposure to asbestos and chemicals  and those claims arising from the handling and or disposal of pollutants such as chemicals and toxic waste 
also included in the review of environmental matters for purposes of excess liability policies was potential exposure relating to litigation over breast implants 
highlands has a dedicated environmental claims unit responsible for handling these types of claims 
environmental claims have arisen in three of the company s product lines  two of which are discontinued lines described above 
the ongoing product line involving increased environmental loss exposure is the general liability policies written by the company as primary insurance provider for its various commercial customers since the discontinued lines that are sources of increased environmental claim exposure are the company s umbrella excess liability program as to which new underwriting activities ceased at the end of and its participation in the assumed casualty reinsurance marketplace  both in london through and the united states most of which were nonrenewed by the end of 
the third quarter of reserve review reevaluated the company s potential environmental exposure  including a review of possible exposure under policies provided to specific high profile or target potential defendants companies identified as being primarily involved in the creation of environmental risks  such as asbestos manufacturers  without regard to whether claims have been reported under such policies  the segmentation of environmental and asbestos data on the us portion of assumed reinsurance  and the review and discussion of the conclusions of the examination with the company s external independent actuaries 
the difficulties inherent in the establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for property and casualty companies are magnified when estimating exposure from environmental claims 
estimation of exposure in regard to such claims involves a large number of variables which are difficult to establish with precision  including determining the actual scope of coverage under existing policies  fixing the date of an occurrence of a covered loss  estimating the ultimate proportion of pollution clean up costs that will be borne by liable parties  evaluating the potential for and nature of legislative relief and other similar items 
the company s historical estimates of reserves for environmental claims for two of the discontinued lines and the primary general liability line have relied primarily upon loss payment and emergence patterns without regard to the year of occurrence separated between asbestos and pollution claims 
the assumptions employed in the recent loss review involved lengthening the assumed loss payment and emergence patterns for pollution claims  which resulted in increased indicated reserves related to these claims across all three business product lines affected by environmental risks 
primary general liability 
the bulk of the company s general liability policies as primary insurer are written for companies headquartered in the geographic region in which the company s activities are focused currently  principally texas and louisiana 
as a result of its regional focus and typical customer profile which has included relatively few large national companies  the company s primary general liability coverage has not included many companies identified as principal targets of major environmental litigation at this time 
certain of the company s insureds do  however  have environmental and asbestos loss exposure  even if not as a target defendant 
one result of insuring potential secondary defendants is that the likely exposure with regard to environmental claims for these insureds takes longer to assess  because claimants often exhaust the potential for recovery from target defendants before actively pressing claims from defendants involved to a lesser degree in the alleged pollution 
the company believes this to be true  particularly for asbestos claims 
the current adjustment to reserves for unreported losses for asbestos claims relating to primary general liability operations recognizes that the company may experience a somewhat slower reporting pattern on these claims due to the nature of the company s exposure on policies written for insureds that have been to date predominantly secondary defendants 
the overall increase to primary general liability reserves for environmental claims was million million before deducting reinsurance 
umbrella excess liability 
the company s umbrella excess liability program consisted of participation in the overall us excess liability marketplace from through in general  larger enterprises were the purchasers of high limits of excess liability protection 
consequently  the company insured many large industrial companies  some of which have or may become the potential primary defendants with regard to significant environmental claims 
the inherent difficulty described above in estimating ultimate loss levels for environmental claims is further complicated with regard to excess of loss policies because the company has no contractual exposure until the policy limits of the insured s underlying coverage are reached 
the loss threshold at which coverage under the excess liability policies issued by the company commences ranged from  to in excess of million 
accordingly  estimation of the company s loss exposure with regard to these policies also involves a difficult evaluation of whether aggregate claims will be made and proven under other insurers policies to trigger the coverage threshold of the policies issued by the company 
the third quarter of loss review involved an evaluation of policies issued by the company to approximately insureds who were potential principal defendants for environmental claims without regard to whether any claims had been filed under these policies 
also included in the analysis was the identification of any policies for which the company might incur losses or loss adjustment expenses related to breast implants 
the resulting reserve increase on the umbrella excess liability program related to unreported losses for environmental and breast implant claims was approximately million million before deducting reinsurance 
assumed reinsurance london and us markets 
net environmental reserves related to the london market were increased by approximately million million before deducting reinsurance 
the london market historically has demonstrated very slow claim recognition  reporting and payment 
the increase in reserves stems primarily from a specific adjustment to the reserves for unreported losses relating to london market claims based on the application of asbestos payment and emergence patterns to the company s reported losses to date 
in addition  the lengthening of loss payment and emergence patterns for unreported pollution claims assumed in the loss reserve review indicated the appropriateness of an increase in the reserve for pollution claims 
in the us market  the company participated in approximately assumed casualty reinsurance contracts per year between and before the product line was substantially discontinued 
as a participant with other reinsurers  the company generally assumed a small percentage of each reinsurance placement 
the majority of the company s exposure for environmental claims on these agreements relates to risks reinsured in the early to mid s 
the information on these contracts currently provided to the company by the ceding companies varies substantially 
some companies provide individual claim detail with clear identification of environmental claims as well as actuarial estimates of ultimate loss levels 
for other companies  very little if any detail regarding individual claims is provided to the company and environmental claims are not separately identified 
some of the ceding companies are no longer in business and the loss information is now provided by a third party that was not originally involved in the reinsurance placement 
in past evaluations  reserves for us assumed reinsurance contracts were aggregated and the company made no specific estimation or segregation of reserves for environmental claims 
during the first nine months of  the company reviewed the individual treaties with the intent to segregate these treaties into relevant groups for actuarial analysis  identified environmental claims to the extent possible with existing information  compiled loss data related to pre periods and separately analyzed the resulting treaty groups and environmental data 
the treaties were divided into the two groups those as to which the company has been able to identify environmental claims and those as to which it has not been able to specifically identify environmental claims 
as a result of this analysis  the company increased the reserve net of reinsurance for unreported losses relating to environmental claims for all of the us assumed casualty reinsurance agreements by million million before deducting reinsurance 
of this amount  million relates to the group of treaties for which the company has been able to identify environmental claims 
for the treaty group that currently does not explicitly provide information to identify environmental claims  the company has established a net provision of million million before deducting reinsurance for unreported environmental losses 
this provision is based on the likelihood that a significant portion of the current payments and incurred loss emergence observed for this treaty group is related to environmental claims activity 
during the company s third quarter of reserve review of the us assumed casualty reinsurance  it was noted that for contracts reporting environmental claims  approximately of the current year s payments and reserve emergence were related to environmental claims 
the company believes that the treaties not identifying environmental claims have a lower exposure to these claims than the treaties that have reported environmental claims and thus has assumed that approximately of the observed payments and reserve emergence on assumed casualty reinsurance contracts not identifying environmental claims are actually related to environmental claims activity 
the company has also assumed that the survival ratios outstanding reserves to average annual payments for the treaties not reporting environmental claims are similar to the survival ratios implied for the treaty group reporting environmental claims 
these assumptions combined with the partial reliance on industry loss reporting patterns excluding environmental and asbestos claims produced the million reserve for unreported environmental claims for this treaty group 
due to the increases in reserve estimates for environmental claims  the company also increased unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves by million in recognition of additional costs related to the settlement of these claims 
the third quarter charge resulted in direct outstanding reserves for environmental claims increasing by million 
this increase is related to the primary general liability and the umbrella excess liability programs 
the company utilizes a traditional industry methodology for determining unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves based on calendar year paid unallocated loss adjustment expense to direct paid loss ratios  case and incurred but not reported reserves outstanding and the assumption of the unallocated loss adjustment expense is paid when a claim is opened and is paid upon closing 
since unallocated loss adjustment expense has a positive relationship with outstanding reserves  the million reserve increase indicated an additional million of unallocated loss adjustment expense reserve was appropriate 
non environmental exposure on assumed reinsurance  catastrophe losses and other insurance related reserves 
the company also established an additional reserve of million million before deducting reinsurance for unreported losses relating to the non environmental exposures for the two assumed reinsurance treaty groups described above 
this estimate was developed in reliance upon historical emergence patterns for highlands assumed reinsurance treaties  reported development patterns compiled by the reinsurance association of america  actuarial estimates provided by the ceding companies and management s judgment as to the likely effects of these factors on the company s loss exposure 
the remaining million million before deducting reinsurance of the increase in reserves was spread over several lines of business 
included in this amount was million of additional unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves  which were established primarily for additional costs related to the settlement of claims and run off costs related to highlands uk 
loss reserves with regard to highlands uk were increased by million million before deducting reinsurance in recognition of continuing loss realization from catastrophes occurring in the through underwriting years 
the remaining reserve increases were not related to specific events  but were deemed to be appropriate adjustments to previous reserve estimates in light of the most recent available data regarding projected expected loss and loss adjustment expense from existing policies 
litigation reserves 
as indicated above  the company increased its reserves for litigation and administrative proceedings against the company by million during the third quarter of and by an additional million in the fourth quarter of in addition  litigation reserves were increased by million in see item legal proceedings 
on may   weatherford roofing company and other plaintiffs commenced an action against employers national insurance company in the th texas state district court in dallas county  texas  alleging that they had been overcharged for workers compensation insurance

on july   the named plaintiffs and a group of insurance company defendants  including the company  entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement  and said agreement has received preliminary approval of the court 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  in july of  notification of the settlement was published in several texas newspapers and mailed to all insureds within the settlement class 
the insureds that have elected to opt out of the settlement will not impact highlands or terminate the settlement agreement 
final approval of the agreement settlement was granted by the court in the fourth quarter of and the distribution of the settlement fund is now expected to occur in the first quarter of the time to appeal the approval of the settlement agreement has now expired 
the company s liability  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  is not in excess of current legal reserves and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
in november  the state of california adopted by ballot initiative proposition  a comprehensive system of regulation applicable to all property and casualty insurance written in california

in january  the state of california department of insurance doi notified the company that it believed that the company had a premium rollback obligation to policyholders under proposition on april   the doi issued a notice of hearing re proposition rollback exemption application in the matter of the rate rollback liability of highlands and highlands underwriters insurance company 
subsequent to the issuance of the notice of hearing there was a prehearing conference order and several motions regarding the extent and nature of discovery 
on june   highlands and highlands underwriters insurance company mailed a settlement offer to the insurance commissioner of the state of california  which was rejected by the commissioner on july  in december of  a decision was entered in the matter of amwest surety insurance company v 
pete wilson  et al 
in that case  the supreme court of the state of california determined that surety insurance would be subject to proposition there were hearings pursuant to the above referenced notice of hearing during may and june of at which the doi asserted that the rollback obligation of highlands and highlands underwriters insurance company was million  plus interest  for a total amount of million 
in connection with such hearing  the administrative law judge was expected to render a decision regarding the company s rollback liability during the last quarter of subsequent to the june of hearing  the company re evaluated its legal reserves  and such reserves were increased in the third quarter of by million to reflect the company s current estimate of its most probable loss 
settlement negotiations occurred during the fourth quarter of  and as a result of the status of such negotiations  legal reserves were increased million in the fourth quarter of on february   this matter was settled for million and such amount is not in excess of current legal reserves and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
the settlement will be submitted to the administrative law judge and the commissioner of insurance for their approval  and the company has no reason to believe at this time that the settlement will not be approved 
in the event the settlement is not approved  the company will continue to defend this matter vigorously 
the remaining portion of the legal reserves relates to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of the company s business 
liquidity and capital resources the company is a holding company  the principal assets of which are all of the capital stock of highlands and million of fixed maturities and cash and cash equivalent investments at december  the company s property and casualty insurance business is conducted by highlands and the other insurance subsidiaries 
the liquidity and capital resource considerations for the company and its insurance subsidiaries are different 
holding company immediately following the distribution  the company issued million in principal amount of debentures for million in cash and million of notes 
of such proceeds  the company invested million in the us insurance subsidiaries as a contribution to surplus  paid approximately million in transactions fees and for reimbursement of out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the debentures and warrants and retained the remaining approximately million for general corporate purposes 
prior to the distribution  the company was included in the halliburton consolidated us federal tax return 
an intercompany tax sharing arrangement between the company and halliburton resulted in the company receiving from or paying to halliburton a cash payment for us federal income taxes based on financial reporting book income rates that were determined by halliburton 
the company was not charged more us federal income tax than it would have paid on a separate return basis 
pursuant to sfas  the company provided for income taxes on its statements of operations as if it had filed separate tax returns in each taxing jurisdiction separate return method 
differences between income tax provisions calculated using the separate return method and amounts calculated under the intercompany tax sharing arrangements are reflected as additions or reductions to stockholders equity  as appropriate 
in the company received from halliburton and forwarded to its insurance subsidiaries approximately million in cash related to the tax benefit of the significant tax losses incurred in which are utilizable by halliburton 
the tax sharing agreement resulted in halliburton acquiring the domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities from its us subsidiaries 
in contemplation of halliburton s distribution of the company s shares  halliburton contributed to the company in the net deferred tax assets attributable to the company which the company recorded as a contribution to capital 
based on the tax free nature of the spin off  the deferred tax asset attributes are available to the company 
the company s other principal sources of funds are dividend and tax sharing payments from highlands  if any  and funds that may be raised from time to time from the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
the payment of dividends by highlands is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by the insurance laws of the state of texas 
the maximum dividend payable by highlands in without approval is approximately million 
both the issuance of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity securities at a price less than current market price would require the consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the debentures pursuant to the covenants contained in the debentures 
as a holding company  the company s principal requirements for funds are to pay operating expenses  to pay franchise and other taxes  to pay debt service and to pay dividends 
operating expenses and franchise and other taxes imposed on the company are not expected to be material 
the annual cash interest requirements relating to the debentures will be approximately million 
the company does not currently intend to pay dividends on the company common stock 
in light of the company s corporate strategy  an additional use of funds may be to invest in other insurance companies or other insurance operations

the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris helps to identify those companies that merit the highest priority in the allocation of the regulators resources on the basis of eleven financial ratios which are calculated annually from financial information obtained from insurers statutory annual statements 
a usual range of results for each ratio is used as a benchmark 
the ratios and benchmark comparisons are calculated within defined parameters and are not intended to replace the insurance commissioners own in depth financial analysis or on site examinations 
departure from the usual range on four or more of the ratios could lead to inquiries from individual commissioners 
an annual range of ratio results has been established from studies of the ratios for companies that have become insolvent or have experienced financial difficulties falling outside the usual range 
the analytical phase is a review of annual statements and the financial ratios 
companies that receive financial ratio values outside the usual range generally are analyzed in order to identify those companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention 
a more comprehensive review of the ratio results in an insurer s annual statement is performed later to confirm that an insurer s situation in fact calls for increased and closer regulatory attention 
if the review confirms that the insurer s situation should be accorded the highest priority in the insurance commissioner s surveillance process  the insurer receives a first priority designation
