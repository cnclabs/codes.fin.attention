historically  the company has experienced lower net revenues during the first fiscal quarter which ends on september as compared with that of the preceding quarter due to fewer referrals during the summer months 
however  the results for the first quarter of fiscal do not reflect this seasonality because of the growth in volume following the acquisitions in fiscal  in october and may net income did not increase proportionately to net revenues as a result of duplicative costs relating to the acquisitions which were not yet eliminated 
the company anticipates that the effects of seasonality will continue for the foreseeable future 
although the company s net revenues tend to be affected by seasonality  quarterly revenues and profitability may also be affected by other factors  including internal growth

liquidity and capital resources consistent with its growth strategy  the company has significantly expanded its operations over the past three years through a combination of internal expansion and acquisitions 
historically  this growth has been principally financed through borrowings under the company s senior credit facilities  installment notes and stock issued to sellers in connection with acquisitions and through the offering 
in november  the company million shares of common stock in the offering raising net proceeds of million which were used principally to repay the bridge financing incurred in connection with the tampa acquisition  certain senior subordinated debt  a portion of the debt incurred under the credit facility and to redeem preferred stock issued in connection with the tampa acquisition and other preferred stock issued in additionally  the company received proceeds aggregating  and  from the exercise of options and warrants during fiscal and  respectively 
working capital increased to million at june  from million at june   an increase of million 
approximately million of this increase was due to the acquisitions in fiscal the remainder primarily resulted from a million increase in accounts receivable  net of receivables recorded by the companies acquired in fiscal  and a million reduction in current liabilities at branch locations existing prior to the acquisitions in fiscal the growth in net revenues during fiscal was accompanied by an increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased by million  or  to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this increase was principally due to acquisitions and internal growth 
days net revenues outstanding decreased slightly from to in fiscal cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal cash used in operating activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and was primarily attributable to the increases in accounts receivable 
the company expects to continue to acquire home health care businesses 
cash flow from operations from acquisitions may be adversely affected if delays are encountered in obtaining required medicare provider numbers or licenses or in meeting other payor requirements 
in addition  in acquisitions in which accounts receivable are not purchased the company is required to fund the working capital requirements of the acquired business until cash collections become adequate for such purpose 
cash expenditures for acquisitions were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
goodwill was million at june  the company recorded goodwill of million with respect to ten acquisitions completed in fiscal annualized amortization of goodwill resulting from these acquisitions is expected to increase to approximately million in fiscal it is anticipated that expenditures for acquisitions will increase in fiscal as the company continues to implement its growth strategy 
expenditures for purchases of capital equipment were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  and are expected to increase by million in fiscal as the company expands its operations  which includes continuing investments in equipment held for rental and in management information systems 
the company typically funds its capital expenditures through a master lease arrangement 
on march   the company amended the credit facility to increase available borrowings from to million  to be used for acquisitions  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
on august   the company had million of unused commitment for working capital and acquisitions under the credit facility 
additionally  on september   the company obtained a commitment from its existing syndicate of senior lenders to amend the credit facility to increase available borrowings from million to million  to be used in part to refinance approximately million of debt to be assumed in connection with the usho acquisition and expenses to be incurred in connection with the acquisition 
the amendment will require that million of existing indebtedness under the credit facility convert to a six year amortizing term loan with increasing amortization beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal the amendment will also i require that of excess cash flow  as defined  be used to reduce the term loan  ii amend certain financial covenants and iii increase the maximum interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement by basis points 
management anticipates the company s available lines of credit and cash flow generated from operations will be adequate to enable the company to fund its operations  capital expenditures and anticipated internal growth for at least the next twelve months 
despite the amount of unused commitment under the credit facility  there is no assurance the company can continue to acquire businesses consistent with the size and number of acquisitions completed through may of fiscal  due to  among other factors  limitations on access to additional funds imposed by the credit facility financial covenants 
impact of inflation a substantial portion of the company s net revenues is subject to reimbursement rates which are regulated by the federal and state governments or through contractual arrangements and do not automatically adjust for inflation 
these reimbursement rates are adjusted periodically based upon certain factors  including legislation and executive and congressional budget reduction and control processes  inflation and costs incurred in rendering the services  but in the past have had little relationship to the actual cost of doing business 
additionally  the company continues to experience pricing pressure from managed care and other payors 
as a result  to the extent that inflation occurs in the future  the company will unlikely be able to pass on all of the increased costs associated with providing home health services to customers insured by government  managed care or other payors 
new accounting pronouncements see the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for information relating to the impact on the company of new accounting pronouncements 
forward outlook and risks the company faces a number of risks 
also see results of operations and government regulation previously discussed 
information contained in this section is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results 
the company s outlook for fiscal is predominantly based upon its interpretation of what it considers key economic assumptions 
currently  medicare reimburses participating medicare certified home health agencies for the reasonable costs incurred to provide covered visits to eligible beneficiaries  subject to certain cost limits which vary according to geographic regions of the country 
the budget act requires hcfa to implement a prospective payment system for home health agencies by october   with up to a four year phase in period 
prospective rates determined by hhs would reflect a reduction to the cost limits and per patient limits as of september  in the event the implementation deadline is not met  the reduction will be applied to the reimbursement system then in place 
the impact of such a change  if implemented  on the company s results of operations cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and would depend  to a large extent  on the reimbursement rates for home nursing established on an interim basis and under the prospective payment system 
there can be no assurances that such reimbursement rates  if enacted  would cover the costs incurred by the company to provide home nursing services 
until prospective payment takes effect on october   the budget act sets up an interim payment system the ips that provides for lowering of reimbursement limits for home health visits 
as amended  cost limit increases for fiscal and have been eliminated 
in addition  for cost reporting periods beginning on july   home health agencies cost limits will be determined as the lesser of i their actual costs ii cost limits based on of median costs of freestanding home health agencies or iii an agency specific per patient cost cap  based on of costs adjusted for inflation 
the company is unable to determine the effect of the ips until hcfa finalizes related regulatory guidance on the implementation of the ips 
the new cost limits will apply to the company for the cost reporting period beginning july  a reduction in these cost limits could have a significant effect on the company s results of operations  however  the effect of such reductions cannot be predicted with any level of certainty 
for cost reporting periods beginning after october   the budget act requires payments for home nursing services be paid based upon the location of the patient s home 
hcfa has publicly expressed concern that some home health agencies are billing for services from offices with higher per visit cost limitations rather than the office serving the patient 
the company s management believes the texas region is the only area where a different per visit cost limitation may result from adoption of these provisions of the budget act 
this will impact the company s cost reporting periods beginning july  however  due to the difficulty in determining the levels of reimbursement based upon the location of the patient s home  as well as the uncertainty regarding the reimbursement rates in these locations  the company cannot predict with any level of certainty the potential reductions in reimbursement resulting from this provision 
the budget act requires a reduction in home oxygen reimbursement from the fee schedule on january  and a further reduction of on january  compounding these reductions is a freeze on consumer price index updates for the next five years 
approximately of the company s current net revenues are derived from applicable oxygen services 
this reduction in oxygen reimbursement will have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
various other provisions included in the budget act may have an impact on the company s business and results of operations 
venipuncture will no longer be a covered skilled nursing home care service unless it is performed in connection with other skilled nursing services 
the company is currently assessing the potential impact of this provision  however  the effect of such reductions cannot be predicted with any level of certainty at this time 
additionally  the company will be required to have surety bonds of at least  for each medicare certified nursing agency and medical equipment company 
additionally  payments will be frozen for durable medical equipment  excluding orthotic and prosthetic equipment  and payments for certain reimbursable drugs and biologicals will be reduced 
the impact of these reimbursement changes on the company s results of operations cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time  and there can be no assurance that such reimbursement levels will cover the costs incurred by the company to provide its services and products 
in addition to the impact on health care reimbursement resulting from the budget act  other changes have been announced in a federal policy which may adversely impact company operations 
hcfa has recently required branch offices to obtain separate licensure and separate provider agreements 
on september   president clinton related in a speech before the service employees international union that there will be a six month waiting period on certifying new home health agencies 
it is unclear what effect this six month waiting period would have on redesignated branch offices or on the company s business  generally 
in may  the clinton administration instituted ort  a health care fraud and abuse initiative focusing on nursing homes  home health care agencies and durable medical equipment companies located in the five states with the largest medicare populations 
the states initially targeted included california  florida  illinois  new york and texas 
ort has been responsible for millions of dollars in civil and criminal restitution  fines  recovery of overpayments and the exclusion of a number of individuals and corporations from the medicare program 
ort has been expanded to all fifty states  with a specific concentration on twelve states including arizona  colorado  georgia  louisiana  massachusetts  missouri  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia and washington 
private insurers and various state enforcement agencies also have increased their scrutiny of health care providers practices and claims  particularly in the home health and durable medical equipment areas 
no assurance can be given that the practices of the company  if reviewed  would be found to be in compliance with such laws or with any future laws  as such laws ultimately may be interpreted 
additionally  hcfa has implemented wedge surveys in at least states  including connecticut  florida  tennessee  illinois  indiana  massachusetts  minnesota  ohio  oklahoma  texas  utah  virginia and wyoming 
in these surveys  hcfa completes ort type surveys on a much smaller scale 
generally  hcfa reviews a small  limited number of claims over a two month period and extrapolates the percentage which was paid in error to all claims paid for the period under review 
assuming the reviewer uncovered nothing significant  the home health agency then has the option to repay the amount determined by hcfa or undergo a broader review of its claims 
if the survey uncovers significant problems  the matter may be referred for further review 
while the company believes that it is in material compliance with the fraud and abuse laws  there can be no assurance that the practices of the company  if reviewed  would be found to be in full compliance with such requirements  as such requirements ultimately may be interpreted 
it is the company s policy to monitor its compliance with such requirements and to take appropriate actions to ensure such compliance 
although the company does not believe it has violated any fraud and abuse laws  there can be no assurance that future related legislation  either health care or budgetary  related regulatory changes or interpretations of such regulations  will not have a material adverse effect on the future operations of the company 
the growth and profitability of the company depends on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with referral sources  including payors  hospitals  physicians and other health care professionals 
managed care organizations  which are exerting an increasing amount of influence over the health care industry  have been consolidating to enhance their ability to impact the delivery of health care services 
as managed care organizations have increased and continue to increase their market share in regions in which the company operates  these organizations have become and will continue to become increasingly important to the company as referral sources 
from fiscal to fiscal  the company s net revenues derived from managed care organizations increased from to 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully maintain existing referral sources or develop and maintain new referral sources 
the loss of any significant existing referral sources or the failure to develop any new referral sources could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company is a leading provider of comprehensive home health care services  delivering nursing and related patient services  respiratory therapy  infusion therapy and durable medical equipment  from current branch locations in ten states 
since fiscal  the company generated a compound annual growth rate in net revenues of through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth 
the company experienced internal growth rates in net revenues of  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s internal growth in net revenues was primarily the result of cross selling its services and products  expanding the range of services and products offered  increasing patient referrals  particularly from managed care organizations  and opening new branch locations
