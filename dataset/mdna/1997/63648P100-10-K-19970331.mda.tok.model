premiums for longer term policies are recorded as revenues when earned 
the company s policies are canceled at a relatively high rate because they generally remain in effect only until financial institutions receive proof that borrowers have obtained their own insurance 
at the time the policies are issued  a reserve is established to provide for return of premiums for anticipated cancellations  which has the effect of decreasing net premiums written 
since  the reserve has been established at approximately to of premiums

the company remains primarily liable to its policyholders in the event any reinsurer is unable or will not fulfill the obligations assumed under reinsurance 
as a result of the cost and availability of reinsurance  in the future the company may elect to retain a higher portion of the risk historically ceded to reinsurers 
if the company were to retain a higher proportion of insured risks  it would increase its exposure to significant losses relating to properties insured by the company 
this increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
during   and  the company ceded losses of    and  respectively  to reinsurers  and for which it has been fully reimbursed 
the company seeks to limit its exposure with respect to any failure by a reinsurer to fulfill its obligations by evaluating the financial condition and rating of members of its reinsurance pool the company s policy is to only purchase reinsurance with us insurers rated a or better by am best at the time of such purchase and by diversifying the reinsurance pool

the company does not anticipate any purchases of specific software or hardware  nor does it anticipate the need to engage outside consultants  to achieve compliance

flood zone determinations the company derives a substantial portion of its total revenues from fees for flood zone determination services 
these services are primarily provided to assist lenders in complying with federal laws which in many instances require lenders to determine whether property being financed is located in a federally designated special flood hazard area sfha and require borrowers to obtain flood insurance 
any significant change in federal legislation or secondary market requirements limiting these requirements on lenders or borrowers  or the development by competitors of significantly enhanced service or delivery systems or an increase in interest rates or a reduction in real estate loan fundings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or operating results 
earnings volatility the company s financial results can be significantly affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the volume of force place insurance and the rate of cancellation of insurance policies  the addition or loss of significant customers  significant changes in the number of loans or personal property leases being tracked for major customers  increases or decreases in interest rates  and catastrophic loss events 
for example  in the insurance subsidiary incurred net losses relating to the los angeles riots and hurricane andrew of  and  respectively 
in november  the insurance subsidiary received claims of approximately  from policyholders for losses arising out of the october and november series of fires in southern california 
the company also received an assessment of  from the california fair plan association  a mandatory insurance pool for certain california real estate  relating to losses from those fires 
in addition  revenues from the company s flood zone determination services are directly related to the volume of mortgage loan originations  both new and refinanced  and any change in the level of such activity could have a material impact on the company s performance 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting operating results the insurance industry  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the insurance industry the company derives a significant amount of its revenues from insurance premiums and investment income 
in the event that  for whatever reason  the insurance subsidiary experiences abnormally high losses  purchases reinsurance from reinsurers who will not or cannot pay losses submitted  or other adverse developments occur  then any such event or combination of events could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition  insurance companies and others have often been sued under certain legal theories  such as bad faith handling or settlement of claims  which could subject the insurance subsidiary to liability in excess of policy limits 
an adverse outcome of any such lawsuit could have a material negative impact on the company 
reserve adequacy the insurance subsidiary is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported losses and incurred but not reported claims 
these reserves are estimates of what the insurance subsidiary expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost  and are based on known facts and circumstances  predictions of future events  estimates of future trends in claims severity and other variable  subjective factors 
no assurances can be given that such estimates will be adequate to cover actual losses incurred by the insurance subsidiary 
any significant changes in the insurance subsidiary s estimate of ultimate losses on reported claims may materially adversely affect the results of the insurance subsidiary s operations in the period reported 
the insurance subsidiary has in the past experienced adverse developments in its loss reserves 
the insurance subsidiary s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are reviewed on an annual basis by unaffiliated actuaries 
the insurance subsidiary s most recent actuarial review of such reserves as of december  concluded that the reserves i met the requirements of the insurance laws of california  ii were computed in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and principles and iii make a reasonable provision for all unpaid loss and loss expense obligations of the insurance subsidiary under the terms of its policies and agreements 
the insurance subsidiary also maintains a reserve for return premiums which is based upon the insurance subsidiary s historical experience 
as is prevalent in the force place insurance industry  a substantial amount of the insurance subsidiary s net premiums written are refunded to policyholders 
the amount of such refunds can be affected by  among other things  inaccurate or untimely data submitted by customers  which the insurance subsidiary uses as a basis for recording written premiums or the loss of a significant customer 
no assurance can be given that the reserve for return premiums will be adequate to cover actual refunded premiums paid by the insurance subsidiary in the future

underwriting risks traditional insurance companies underwrite risks individually or by class  following an in depth analysis of such risks 
although the insurance subsidiary applies underwriting techniques to a small portion of insured risks  the immediate coverage required by purchasers of force place insurance generally requires the insurance subsidiary to write specialized insurance within predesignated limits and geographic area  at a flat rate  without the application of traditional underwriting criteria to individual risks 
accordingly  the insurance subsidiary may be insuring individual risks that it might not have insured had it applied traditional analysis to such risks 
in addition  the insurance subsidiary may not have adequate spread of risk in a particular geographic area 
see insurance operations underwriting 
reinsurance considerations the insurance subsidiary s business is partially dependent upon its ability to cede to reinsurers risks insured by the insurance subsidiary 
the amount  availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions  beyond the control of the insurance subsidiary  which can affect the insurance subsidiary s level of business and profitability 
the insurance subsidiary is ultimately liable for the reinsured risk if for any reason the reinsurers do not cover or will not pay the insurance subsidiary for the losses of the insureds 
as a result of the anticipated increased cost and more limited availability of reinsurance  in the future  the insurance subsidiary may elect to retain a higher portion of the risk historically ceded to reinsurers 
if the insurance subsidiary were to retain a higher proportion of insured risks  it would increase its exposure to significant losses relating to properties insured by the insurance subsidiary 
this increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation 
see regulation reinsurance 
pinnacle and or the company also indemnifies its customers for certain losses resulting from erroneous flood inquiry determinations  where a borrower was not properly advised whether the collateral was located in or out of an sfha 
while to date pinnacle has experienced no significant losses in this regard and maintains reserves equal to its estimate of incurred but unreported indemnification losses  there can be no assurance such reserves will prove adequate in the future 
the company does not maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage against losses 
rapid technological change and new products  product delays the markets for the company s information services are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
the company believes that its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to identify  develop  install and support new services in a timely fashion  and on market acceptance of such services 
no assurance can be given that the introduction of new technologies will enable the company to gain market share  realize cost savings or increase revenues
