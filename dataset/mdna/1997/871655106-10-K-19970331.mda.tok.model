item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview gtc provides advanced manufacturing  engineering and testing services to oems of electronic products and also to certain end users such as united states government agencies 
these services include the manufacture of circuit card assemblies  subsystems and end user products for use in a wide variety of markets 
in providing these services  gtc is affected by a number of internal and external factors including  but not limited to  materials management and availability  working capital needs  variability of customer requirements  production start up costs  industry trends and competition 
gtc s operating results are also dependent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees and upon its ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
during and during the first quarter of  gtc experienced turnover of certain key employees  including its president and chief executive officer and other executive officers of the company 
see item and item in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the executive officers of the company 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from gtc s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and expressed as a percentage of revenue 
caption 
years ended december  revenue cost of operations gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research and development operating income loss interest expense other expense income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue decreased by to million for  as compared to million for the net decrease in revenue of million is related to the decrease in gtc s name brand product line revenue of million net of contract claim revenue recognized in of million and a decrease in the tampa based manufacturing and engineering services operations of million  partially offset by an increase in sales by gtc s international ems operations of million 
the decrease in name brand product line revenue results from the disposition of substantially all of the assets of metrum and gtc s badger business 
these dispositions  which occurred during and  are more fully discussed under the caption disposition of assets included herein below 
the decrease in the name brand products revenues was partially offset by the successful settlement of a million name brand product contract claim during the second quarter of the tampa manufacturing services business continues to suffer from underutilized capacity 
a large government contract was completed late in and orders on two commercial contracts were reduced during due to the customers need to reduce their inventory levels 
gtc also lost opportunities with two commercial customers due to a change in outsourcing strategies which resulted in the loss of a significant level of planned business 
during  gtc s domestic operations also experienced the impact of reduced demand from certain semiconductor industry customers and also suffered from increased facility underutilization related to certain contract terminations 
the company also expects certain contract requirements to decline during  which could further reduce the utilization of the domestic operations 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of these reduced contract requirements  management is implementing cost reduction strategies and is increasing its tampa marketing efforts on high product mix and advanced packaging services 
gtc s latin american manufacturing services business grew significantly during and gtc entered into a manufacturing services agreement in july to provide contract manufacturing services in brazil to gtc s largest commercial customer  ibm 
the brazilian operation began contributing to revenue and operating profit during the third quarter of during  gtc s presence in brazil expanded as a result of the start up of a second brazilian facility 
while the company also fostered growth at its mexican facility during  certain mexican based contracts were terminated during  creating underutilized capacity at that facility 
in response to this underutilized capacity  the company has retained new marketing management and has increased its high volume manufacturing marketing efforts 
to enhance gtc s prospects for achieving an adequate revenue load in future periods  management has structured the marketing and sales function to optimize the company s capabilities at each of its manufacturing facilities 
the marketing efforts for gtc s domestic  mexican and brazilian manufacturing services operations are focused on high product mix and advanced packaging  high volume manufacturing  and box build services  respectively 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for  compared to million for the gross margin increased to in as compared to in the net increase of million represents an increase in gross profit in the tampa based manufacturing and engineering services operations of million and an increase from increased sales by gtc s latin american operations of million  partially offset by a decrease associated with gtc s divestiture of name brand product lines of million 
the name brand product line claim referred to above contributed million to gross profit 
therefore  adjusting for the effect of this claim  the gross margin percentage in remained relatively consistent with the percentage 
included in the costs of operations in are costs amounting to million which are more fully discussed below 
gtc s ability to generate the expected level of profitability on contracts is highly dependent on its ability to effectively manage materials 
the company recognized inventory adjustments of million  including million related to two contract terminations during the year and million related to excessive domestic and foreign scrap and related physical inventory adjustments 
gtc performed its physical inventory counts on a semi annual basis during and will continue to evaluate its inventory control and physical inventory count procedures to minimize the risk of material adjustments in the future 
management also evaluated the profitability on certain long term contracts and recorded costs associated with changes in contract estimates of loss contracts of million during the second quarter of and million in the fourth quarter 
other estimate changes on long term contracts were also recognized during these estimate changes principally resulted from the company s inability to achieve expected labor costs or material costs during the year 
costs associated with asset disposals and deferred rent payments for capital equipment amounted to million 
severance costs also negatively impacted gross margin by million in during  the company also recognized significant charges to its operations  which are more fully discussed under the caption year ended december  compared to year ended december  included herein below 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense was million or of revenue in  as compared to million or of revenue for this decrease principally represents a million reduction of costs associated with the sale of substantially all of the assets of metrum 
decreased administrative expenses also resulted from continued cost reduction initiatives including work force reductions during cost reduction activities implemented at various times during contributed to the significant cost reductions realized in as compared to the full year ended december  these reductions offset the impact of million of costs in  including severance costs of million and costs incurred for the expected closure of a tampa warehouse of million 
with regard to warehouse costs  in the second quarter of gtc implemented a cost saving strategy to integrate the materials warehousing function into its main tampa facility 
the total cost of the move was originally estimated to be million  but an increased cost of million was recorded in the fourth quarter based on actual costs incurred and the review of additional information regarding sublease strategies 
selling  general and administrative expense also includes million of provisions for doubtful accounts receivable  as compared to million recognized in the provision for doubtful accounts in both and represents a change in estimate of collectibility following extensive communications with the respective customers regarding non payment of invoices and conclusions or settlements reached during the year regarding ultimate collectibility 
research and development research and development expense was million or of revenue in  as compared to million or of revenue for the decrease reflects the fact that the company s research and development efforts have historically been concentrated on the divested name brand products business units 
gtc s manufacturing and engineering services businesses are expected to continue to require limited levels of research and development in the future 
interest expense interest expense was million or of revenue in  as compared to million or of revenue in interest expense remained relatively constant with levels despite a significant reduction in outstanding debt during the increased interest rate is partly attributable to the amortization of warrants issued in the first quarter of in connection with an amended and restated credit facility 
the increased interest rate also results from a higher weighted average interest rate incurred in the second half of and throughout on the company s principal credit facility 
income tax expense income tax expense of million in is primarily attributable to the company s international operations and metrum state taxes payable 
while an income tax benefit of million was recognized in  as of december   the company had substantially exhausted the benefits of any income tax loss carrybacks 
also as of december   the company has recorded a valuation allowance for all temporary differences and income tax loss carryforwards 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue decreased by to million for  as compared to million for the net change in revenue was derived from an increase in sales by gtc s expanding latin american operations offset by a decrease in sales related to the divestiture of certain of gtc s name brand product lines during the second quarter of  a decline in sales from the balance of the name brand product lines and a decrease in sales to commercial customers of gtc s domestic manufacturing services business 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million for  compared to million for the gross margin decreased to in as compared to in the decline in gross profit is attributable to depressed margins on gtc s domestic and international manufacturing services and charges during totaling million related to inventories  estimated losses on terminated contracts  asset disposals  operating lease liabilities and severance costs 
the lower margin performance on the domestic and international manufacturing service resulted from the start up of new contracts in gtc s tampa and mexican operations which replaced certain high margin contracts completed in the fourth quarter of additionally  a higher percentage of gtc s revenue was realized from contracts performed with consigned materials at relatively high gross margins as compared to during  gtc also recognized gross profit of million resulting from favorable changes in contract and claim estimates and million from the settlement of a government contract termination claim 
management exercises careful judgment in its determination of the adequacy of its reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
charges recognized by gtc during the second and fourth quarters of were the result of thorough evaluations conducted by management in the respective quarters of these reserve balances 
gtc charged million and million to cost of operations during the second and fourth quarters of  respectively  to increase its reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
included in the fourth quarter charge for excess and obsolete inventories was million related to badger inventories 
the badger product line was divested in march concurrent with its review of inventory levels during the second quarter of  management also evaluated a number of its contracts which were not meeting gtc s volume or margin targets 
the review resulted in improved pricing on certain contracts  however  it also resulted in decisions  mutually agreed to with customers  to terminate unprofitable contracts 
gtc charged million and million to cost of operations during the second and fourth quarters of  respectively  to recognize estimated losses on terminated or unprofitable contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  management evaluated the probability of a contribution to future earnings from a certain specialized manufacturing equipment item currently under lease 
the operating lease was entered into in november and gtc has since been unsuccessful in attracting customers requiring this specific technology 
during the implementation of the technology center concept during the fourth quarter of  management determined that this equipment did not adequately match the strategies of any of the technology centers 
following its review of the business opportunities for this equipment  management elected to pursue the disposition of the equipment through a sale or assignment of lease 
management charged million to cost of operations during the fourth quarter of to recognize the net present value of future costs associated with this lease 
gtc conducted its annual physical inventory count for its domestic and international manufacturing businesses on october  and december   respectively 
management subsequently completed the reconciliation of its perpetual inventory records to its physical count which resulted in a fourth quarter charge to cost of operations of approximately million and an additional inventory adjustment for an accounts payable reconciliation performed contemporaneously with the physical inventory of million 
the significant difference between the perpetual and physical amounts was not anticipated by management 
management believes that improvements in the stability of gtc s material management system and the implementation of additional inventory control procedures will reduce the likelihood of significant book to physical adjustments in the future 
gtc has also implemented user training programs to certify the users on the materials management system 
gtc also recognized certain other charges during the fourth quarter totaling million related to the disposal of idle manufacturing equipment 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense was million or of revenue in  as compared to million or of revenue for selling  general and administrative expense decreased due to company wide cost reduction initiatives implemented at various times throughout and the divestiture of two of metrum s lines of name brand products during the second quarter 
these reductions offset the impact of a million provision for uncollectible accounts during including million recorded in the second quarter following extensive communications with the respective customers regarding non payment of invoices and conclusions or settlements reached regarding ultimate collectibility and increased costs associated with gtc s latin american operations 
gtc also recognized certain other charges during the second quarter totaling million related to employee severance costs and costs associated with an uncompleted business acquisition 
gtc also recognized a charge during the fourth quarter totaling million related to the write off of terminated financing agreement costs 
research and development research and development expense was million or of revenue in  as compared to million or of revenue for reductions in research and development expense were implemented in the first quarter of  and the second quarter metrum divestitures resulted in further reductions 
interest expense interest expense was million or of revenue in  as compared to million or of revenue in interest expense increased due to a significant increase in the average debt outstanding and an increase in the company s interest rate which occurred during the third quarter of income tax expense income taxes include current and deferred tax benefits and expense in and gtc recorded a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets during gtc also recorded a current tax benefit for the amount of federal and state income taxes refundable as a result of the operating loss 
dispositions of assets beginning in  management focused its attention toward the actions necessary to return gtc s core manufacturing services business to profitability 
management believed that the focus of gtc s human and financial resources should be directed to its core business and  therefore  made decisions during to begin the divestiture of substantially all of gtc s line of name brand products 
another factor considered by management in reaching its decision to divest these operations was gtc s need to reduce its outstanding debt under its revolving credit agreement  which resulted in part from non compliance with its credit agreement 
these divestitures were completed during the first quarter of gtc s product offerings historically included a line of name brand products 
all sales of gtc s metrum subsidiary were considered name brand products  namely computer peripheral products  digital color imaging products and instrumentation recording products 
gtc also marketed a line of ruggedized computers under the badger tradename 
management successfully completed sale transactions for substantially all of the assets of the peripherals products and imaging products businesses during the second quarter of and the instrumentation products and badger products businesses during the first quarter of the aggregate sales price of the name brand products businesses was approximately million  which was paid with million in cash and a note receivable of million 
gtc retained approximately million in liabilities associated with the metrum business  which liabilities related primarily to certain employee benefits  accrued income taxes and commissions 
gtc retained certain warranty obligations of the badger product in addition to performance obligations under a contract with a customer who is in competition with the buyer of the assets 
gtc recorded charges of million and million to cost of operations and other expense  respectively  during the second quarter of related to the metrum divestitures and a million charge to cost of operations during the fourth quarter of to write down its badger inventories to the negotiated sale price 
gtc recorded a million increase in capital related to the first quarter instrumentation products divestiture 
revenue from gtc s name brand products line  in the aggregate  typically generated higher gross profit margins than revenue from gtc s manufacturing and engineering services 
however  the development of name brand products and the maintenance and growth of the market position of these name brand products require significantly higher amounts of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenditures than are required by gtc s manufacturing and engineering services 
foreign currency in addition to its domestic operations  gtc provides manufacturing services in brazil and mexico 
the company recognized foreign currency exchange losses due to the devaluation of the mexican new peso  which  in the aggregate  amounted to million or of revenue in foreign currency transaction gains and losses in latin america have generally not been significant 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the principal contributors to the positive operating cash flow in include recognition and collection of a name brand products claim  collection of income tax refunds  collection of accounts receivable and reduced inventory levels 
significant cash payments reducing accounts payable served to partially off set the positive contributing items 
at the end of  the company was substantially beyond its payment terms with its suppliers 
while gtc continues to extend its payments beyond normal terms  a significant effort was made during to reduce the days accounts payable are outstanding  contributing to the overall reduction in accounts payable 
gtc has long term relationships with a majority of its suppliers and as a result  has been successful in continuing to work on reasonable credit terms with its supplier base 
net cash provided by investing activities was million as compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in capital expenditures in and were million and million  respectively 
gtc s investments in manufacturing equipment in both and were required to expand its latin american capacity  maintain its competitive position and respond to technological changes 
the company expects its capital expenditures in to be comparable to or less than levels 
the divestiture of gtc s name brand product lines during and generated net proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million during and  respectively 
during both and  gtc significantly reduced debt outstanding on its primary credit agreement and other debt 
the reductions were principally provided for by the divestiture of gtc s name brand products line in the first quarter of  settlement of a name brand products claim  and by income tax refunds received during the year 
gfp also invested million in to provide funding for the start up of gtc s brazilian operation 
the credit agreement between gtc and its bank entered into on march  the credit agreement was amended on march  as more fully discussed below  the march  amendment the amendment resulted in  among other matters  reduced credit availability  an investment from gfp  and more lenient financial covenants 
a revolving credit facility issued under the credit agreement provided credit availability up to million through december and  as amended  provides million through march  subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
during  gtc fully repaid a million note and reduced the principal outstanding on a million term note by million 
both of the notes payable were issued under the credit agreement 
during the first quarter of  gtc repaid an additional million on the million term note 
in connection with execution of the credit agreement in  gfp invested million in gtc in exchange for  shares of gtc common stock 
gtc also issued warrants to the bank to purchase million shares of gtc common stock for

the bank will forfeit any unvested warrants in the event gtc repays all debt outstanding prior to any warrant vesting date 
in connection with the amendment  during the first quarter of gfp invested million in gtc in exchange for  shares of gtc preferred stock the preferred stock 
the preferred stock is redeemable and pays quarterly dividends of per annum 
the preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the holder upon repayment by the company of all of its outstanding credit agreement indebtedness
