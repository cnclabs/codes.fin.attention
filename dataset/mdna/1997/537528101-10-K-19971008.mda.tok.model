fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended may  increased approximately million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales for stores open in all of fiscal and decreased approximately million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal both the large increase in overall sales and the comparable store sales decline are attributable to the impact in fiscal of hurricanes luis and marilyn which inflicted damage to several of the company s stores and caused significant damage to various islands infrastructures 
those stores that were not damaged and did remain open in fiscal benefited from the closure of neighboring stores and thus reported higher than normal sales 
the store located on the harbor in marigot  st 
martin  the last of the hurricane damaged stores  reopened in november  while the reopening of the company s hurricane damaged stores and the opening of two new stores in fiscal contributed to the overall increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  management believes that the impact of the hurricanes continued to have a negative impact on sales into fiscal gross profit margin improved slightly from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal management attributes this improvement to the stronger us dollar measured against european currencies partially offset by the impact on margins of certain inventory liquidation efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended may  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is largely due to the estimated loss of approximately million resulting from the employee theft described above  which has been classified as a general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended may  see employee defalcation loss

management also noted higher depreciation associated with stores remodeled after the hurricanes 
net interest expense increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to higher average borrowings  caused by the company s acquisition of the inventory  leasehold rights  and fixed assets of its two stores in barbados

the company utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business that will be affected by the year problem  which is common to most corporations  and concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer software programs  to recognize and process date sensitive information properly as the year approaches 
an internal study is currently under way to determine the full scope and related costs of the year problem to ensure that the company s systems continue to meet its internal needs and those of its customers 
the company currently believes it will be able to modify or replace its affected systems in time to minimize any detrimental effects on operations 
while it is not possible  at present  to give an accurate estimate of the cost of this work  the company expects that such costs may be material to its results of operations in one or more fiscal quarters or years  but will not have a material adverse impact on the long term results of operations  liquidity or consolidated financial position of the company 
system maintenance or software modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of new software will be capitalized and amortized over the software s useful life

gross profit margin decreased from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal the company attributes this decline to the weak us dollar as compared to european currencies during the early portion of the year as well as the impact of certain fixed components of cost of sales as measured against a much lower sales base 
sg a expenses were million or million and higher than a year ago

thomas sales were flat due to ongoing street and sewer construction which affected the downtown area where most of the stores are located as well as a weak summer tourist season which negatively impacted sales in the first half of the fiscal year

gross profit margins decreased from of net sales in fiscal to in fiscal thereby impairing overall net income

the weighted average interest rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the borrowing represented utilization of the company s short term credit facilities to finance inventory buildup prior to the high selling season 
the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary needs for liquidity are to support its inventory requirements  which fluctuate during the year due to the seasonal nature of the company s business  and to maintain and remodel its existing stores and finance the opening or acquisition of new stores 
inventory is maintained at levels to adequately meet the demands of customers who  as tourists  require immediate delivery of purchased goods

the company has available unsecured credit facilities of million of which million in borrowings were outstanding as of may  additionally  in february  the company secured term debt of approximately million from its two lead banks to finance its acquisition of the fixtures  leasehold rights and inventories of two stores in barbados 
interest on this debt is payable monthly and the principal is payable in equal quarterly payments over a four year period commencing march as of may   the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants related to its unsecured and term debt agreements 
additionally  the company has available separate facilities for foreign exchange contracts 
it remains management s expectation that funds available from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund operations and expansion for at least the next three years 
capital expenditures excluding acquisitions during fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal include approximately million for the refurbishment of existing stores and approximately  for computer and point of sale hardware and software upgrades 
capital expenditures during fiscal included approximately million for new stores and fixtures and million for the refurbishment of existing stores and approximately  for computer and point of sale hardware and software upgrades 
the company currently leases of its stores and anticipates obtaining retail space for new stores through leases 
this arrangement allows the company to more effectively design and decorate its stores with quality furnishings consistent with the prestigious image the company maintains 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal in nature  reflecting travel patterns to the caribbean 
the peak selling season in the caribbean runs from late fall through spring 
accordingly  approximately one third of the company s sales have historically occurred during the third fiscal quarter  and the company may incur losses in the first and second fiscal quarters 
working capital requirements generally reflect this seasonality as the company increases its inventory in anticipation of the peak selling season 
since the company has less cash available in the off season  it may be necessary to borrow to finance its build up of inventory and any expansion of the company s operations 
unaudited quarterly financial information for the company for fiscal and is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation historically  the company has generally been able to increase prices to reflect cost increases resulting from inflation and expects to be able to do so in the future 
while the company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation on its operations  the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflation during the three most recent years 
exchange rates while the company receives united states dollars for most of its sales  a significant portion of the company s inventory purchases are transacted in foreign currencies 
because of the company s need to maintain adequate levels of inventory  the company must place large orders for merchandise many months in advance of when it will receive payment for the merchandise from customers 
the company s ability to offer attractive pricing of luxury goods purchased in foreign currency depends in part on the relative exchange rates between the united states dollar and the various foreign currencies 
the company engages in hedging transactions to minimize the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on the company s results of operations 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations for purchase commitments and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
the company believes that foreign currency hedging has been effective in minimizing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on gross margin in prior years and expects to continue this program
