total securities increased by million  consisting of a million increase in securities available for sale and a million increase in securities held to maturity 
the increase in securities available for sale primarily reflects million in purchases of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  us government agencies and us treasury notes  partially offset by maturities  calls and principal paydowns of million and sales of million

the million or increase in net income was primarily the result of a million increase in net interest income and a million decrease in income tax expense  partially offset by increases of million in other expense and million in the provision for loan losses 
net interest income net interest income increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the components of net interest income are interest and dividend income  which increased million or  and interest expense on deposits and other borrowings  which increased million or 
the company s interest rate spread narrowed by basis points from in to in  attributable to a basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities and a basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s net interest margin also narrowed in  declining basis points to from in  primarily a result of the change in interest rate spread 
the reductions in net interest margin and spread were primarily due to the temporary investment of net proceeds received in the acquisition of branches 
the majority of these proceeds were temporarily placed into investment securities until the funds could be reinvested into higher yielding loans 
without the impact of interest on income tax refunds  as described in note to the table on page  the spread and margin would have narrowed by an additional and basis points  respectively  compared to interest on loans increased million  or  primarily reflecting increases in the volume of outstanding loans 
average mortgage and other loans increased by million during interest on mortgage backed securities increased million  or  due to an increase of million in the average balance outstanding and an increase of basis points in the average yield earned on the portfolio 
the higher yield was attributable to current year purchases of securities and upward adjustments on adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
interest and dividends on us treasury and agencies  corporate and other securities increased by million  primarily reflecting a million increase in the average balance outstanding  primarily due to purchases of us treasury and agency securities partially offset by maturities and calls 
the average portfolio yield declined by basis points  primarily reflecting a decrease in the yield on government agency securities as a result of calls and maturities of higher yielding securities 
interest on federal funds sold and other interest income decreased  primarily reflecting the lower average yield on federal funds sold and a million decrease in the average balance outstanding during the year 
the decrease in interest on federal funds sold was substantially offset by  of interest income associated with refunds of certain prior years federal income taxes 
the million increase in interest expense was primarily due to a million increase in average interest bearing deposits due to the acquisition of two branches during april management s policy is to review deposit interest rates at least weekly and to adjust appropriately based on general market conditions  the need for funds  competition and the effect on the net interest margin 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is a charge against income which increases the allowance for loan losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically and is determined based on management s judgment concerning the amount of risk and potential for loss inherent in the portfolio 
management s judgment is based upon a number of factors including a review of non performing and other classified loans  the value of collateral for such loans  historical loss experience  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  and current economic conditions 
the provision for loan losses was million in  an increase of million compared to the provision of  in the higher provision was made to increase the allowance for loan losses in line with the company s loan growth and changes in portfolio mix 
the allowance for loan losses represented of total loans at december  compared to a year earlier 
the allowance increased by million in after net charge offs of million to million at year end  while total loans increased by million  or  during the year 
the portfolio growth included a net increase of million  or  in categories other than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
non performing loans decreased to million  or of total loans  at december  from million  or of total loans  at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans increased to at december  from a year earlier 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management also considers the level of slow paying loans  or loans where the borrower is contractually past due to days or more  but has not yet been placed on non accrual status 
at december   slow paying loans amounted to million as compared to million at december  loan loss provisions in future periods will continue to depend on trends in the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio  loan mix and the level of loan charge offs which  in turn  will depend in part on the economic and real estate market conditions prevailing within the company s lending region 
if general economic conditions or real estate values deteriorate  the level of delinquencies  non performing loans and charge offs may increase and higher provisions for loan losses may be necessary 
other income sources of other income include deposit and other service fees  net gain loss on securities  net gain loss on sales of loans  and other non interest income 
other income remained relatively unchanged at million for both and deposit service fees  the largest component of other income  increased by  or  to million for from million for this was primarily the result of an increase in retail checking account fees due to the acquisition of branches during the second quarter of other service fees totaled  for compared to  for net loss on securities was  for compared to a net gain of  for the net loss in primarily reflects the net realized loss on the sale of us treasury securities  while the net gain in primarily reflects the gain of  on the sale of equity securities in the fourth quarter 
there have been no sales of securities classified as held to maturity 
net gain on sales of loans was  for compared to  for sales of mortgage loans in both years reflect the company s current practice of selling newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans 
other expense other expense consists of general and administrative expenses incurred in managing the core business of the company and the net costs associated with managing and selling other real estate properties 
total other expense increased by million  or  to million for from million for this reflects amortization of intangible assets in  as well as increases in salaries and employee benefits expense  net cost of other real estate  and occupancy and equipment expense 
these factors were partially offset by decreases in fdic deposit insurance expense and other non interest expense 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of other expense  increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase primarily reflects additional expense due to the acquisition of branches  as well as the hiring of additional staff and normal merit and promotional salary increases 
occupancy and equipment expense increased  or  to million for from million for  primarily due to the acquisition of branches as well as other increases in depreciation  maintenance  and equipment rental and repair expenses 
the net cost of other real estate increased  to  for from  for the previous year 
the investment in other real estate properties before the allowance for losses increased to million at december  from  at december  the higher costs in reflect a  increase in the provision for losses on other real estate as a result of the increase in the other real estate owned portfolio and management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for other real estate losses 
the increase in the net cost of other real estate also includes a  increase in net holding costs  reflecting the larger portfolio of properties in the current year 
fdic deposit insurance expense decreased to  for from  for  reflecting a further reduction in fdic insurance premium rates effective january  amortization of intangible assets totaled million for  primarily reflecting the amortization of the purchase premium as a result of the acquisition of branches 
other non interest expense decreased  or  to million for from million for the decrease in other non interest expense was primarily attributable to adjustments related to the company s claim against nationar  a check clearing and trust company which was seized by the new york state superintendent of banks in february at that time  the company had approximately million in federal funds sold and other deposits invested with nationar 
based on management s concerns about the probability of fully collecting this balance  a provision for losses of million was recognized in other non interest expense for in june and december  the company received cash distributions which fully satisfied its claim and  accordingly  the valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of as a credit to other non interest expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
excluding the effect of the nationar adjustments  other non interest expense increased by million in compared to  primarily reflecting increases in professional and outside service fees  foreclosure and collection expense  and other operating costs 
professional and outside service fees increased by  primarily due to increased atm fees due to additional atm s in service in as well as increased loan processing fees as a result of increased lending activity 
foreclosure and collection expense increased by  primarily reflecting additional real estate taxes and other expenses on delinquent loans 
accruals for real estate taxes were made in in response to new procedures adopted by certain local municipalities which accelerated the foreclosure process when real estate taxes are delinquent 
income tax expense income tax expense of million in consisted of a provision of million  or of pre tax income  less a federal benefit of million and a state benefit of  relating to settlements with the tax authorities of audits of certain prior years tax returns 
for  the company recognized income tax expense of million or of pre tax income 
the valuation allowance applicable to the company s federal deferred tax asset was reduced by  in primarily due to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards during the year 
the company s net deferred tax assets were million at december   compared to million at december  based on recent historical and anticipated future pre tax earnings  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize its net deferred tax assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  general the company s net income was million or per share for as compared to million or per share for the  decrease in net income was primarily the result of a million increase in income tax expense  a million decrease in net interest income  and a  increase in other non interest expense 
these items were partially offset by a million increase in other income primarily due to the improved results from sales of securities and loans  a million decrease in the net cost of other real estate  a  decrease in the provision for loan losses  and a  decrease in fdic deposit insurance premiums 
the decrease in earnings per share attributable to lower net income was partially offset by the effect of the company s stock repurchase programs which resulted in the buyback of  shares in net interest income net interest income decreased million  or  to million for compared to million for the components of net interest income are interest and dividend income  which increased million or  and interest expense on deposits  which increased million or 
the company s interest rate spread narrowed by basis points to in from in  reflecting an basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets 
the net interest margin also narrowed by basis points to in from in  primarily reflecting the narrower interest rate spread 
the overall increase in interest and dividend income consisted of a million increase in interest on loans  a million increase in the interest on federal funds sold  and an  increase in interest on mortgage backed securities  partially offset by a million decrease in interest and dividends on us treasury and agencies  corporate and other securities 
the increase in interest on loans was attributable to an increase in the volume of loans outstanding 
the yields on loans were generally higher in  despite the changing mix of the portfolio toward adjustable rate loans which generally have initial rates lower than comparable fixed rate loans 
these factors were partially offset by the positive effect on interest income of continued reductions in non accrual loans 
the increase in interest on federal funds sold was due to increases in both the average balance outstanding and the average rate earned 
interest on mortgage backed securities increased primarily a result of an increase in the average portfolio yield due to purchases of securities with higher yields  as well as upward adjustments on adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
the decline in interest and dividends on us treasury and agencies  corporate and other securities primarily reflects a decrease in the average balance outstanding due to maturities and  to a lesser degree  the effect of corporate securities being called prior to maturity 
funds provided by maturities and calls were generally reinvested in us treasury notes and mortgage backed securities 
the average rate earned on us treasury and agencies  corporate and other securities increased in as a result of purchases of securities with higher yields and the sale of lower yielding securities during the fourth quarter of the million increase in interest on interest bearing liabilities was due primarily to an increase in the cost of funds as a result of the generally higher interest rate environment in  as well as the shift in the mix of deposits from lower cost savings deposits to higher cost time and money market deposits 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in  a reduction of  from the provision of million in the lower provision primarily reflects the continued reduction in non performing loans  and continued stable conditions in the local economy and most sectors of the real estate market 
non performing loans declined to million  or of total loans  at december  from million  or of total loans  at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans increased to at december  from a year earlier 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management also considers the level of slow paying loans  or loans where the borrower is contractually past due to days or more  but has not yet been placed on non accrual status 
at december   slow paying loans amounted to million as compared to million at december  other income other income increased to million in from  in deposit service fees  the largest component of other income  increased by  or  to million for from million for this was primarily the result of an increase in retail checking account fees 
other service fees remained relatively unchanged at  for from  for the previous year 
net gain on securities was  for compared to a net loss of million for the net gain on securities in primarily reflects the gain of  recorded on the sale of equity securities in the fourth quarter 
the net loss in primarily represents losses of million on the sale of us treasury and agency securities of million and other debt securities of million  partially offset by gains of  on the sale of mortgage backed securities of million and equity securities of  the securities sold were classified as available for sale securities and primarily represented debt securities with longer maturities  low yielding equity securities  and mortgage backed securities with low remaining principal balances 
the sales were primarily made to restructure portions of the portfolio  in order to shorten maturities and improve yield 
there were no sales of securities classified as held to maturity in either or net gain on sales of loans was  for compared to a net loss of million for the net loss in primarily reflects the sale of seasoned conforming fixed rate mortgages that management decided to sell in the fourth quarter as part of the company s on going effort to manage interest rate risk and increase liquidity 
in addition  sales of mortgage loans in both years reflect the company s current practice of selling newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans 
other expense other expense decreased by million  or  to million for from million for  primarily due to decreases in the net cost of other real estate and fdic deposit insurance expense  partially offset by an increase in other non interest expense 
salaries and employee benefits increased  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily the result of additional staff and normal merit and promotional salary increases  partially offset by lower medical insurance costs as a result of a change in insurance provider and a reduction in postretirement benefits expense 
occupancy and equipment costs increased  or  to million for from million for the net cost of other real estate decreased million  or  to  for from million for the previous year  primarily reflecting a  reduction in the provision for losses as a result of the decline in the other real estate owned portfolio and management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for other real estate losses 
the investment in other real estate properties before the allowance for losses declined substantially from million at december  to  at december  the decline in the net cost of other real estate also includes a million decrease in net holding costs  reflecting the smaller portfolio of properties in fdic deposit insurance expense decreased  or  to  for from million for the significant decrease primarily reflects the reduction of the insurance premium rate applicable to pawling s deposits 
other non interest expense increased  or  to million for from million for the increase primarily reflects a million provision for losses in with respect to the company s nationar claim  as previously discussed 
the provision was partially offset by a reduction of  in foreclosure and collection expense 
income tax expense the company recognized income tax expense of million in  or of pre tax income for the year 
for  the company recognized an income tax benefit of  consisting of a benefit of million from a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  less a provision of million or of pre tax income for the year 
in  the company reduced the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by  primarily due to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards during the year 
in  the valuation allowance applicable to the company s federal deferred tax asset was reduced by million  commensurate with the increase during the year in federal income taxes recoverable by loss carryback 
in addition  the valuation allowance applicable to the company s state deferred tax asset was reduced by million in the fourth quarter of this latter reduction was based upon management s reevaluation of the company s prospects for future earnings considering factors such as i the reduction in non performing assets and other higher risk assets primarily attributable to the bulk sales in the fourth quarter of  ii the reduction in interest rate risk attributable to the sale of primarily lower yielding fixed rate loans and securities in the fourth quarter of  and iii the sustained level of recent historical pre tax earnings  including the achievement of three consecutive years of consistent profitability 
the state deferred tax asset has been recognized on the basis of expected earnings in future years  as the new york state tax law does not allow net operating loss carrybacks or carryforwards 
asset quality non performing assets are principally comprised of non performing loans non accrual loans and loans greater than days past due and still accruing and other real estate properties 
the company s policy is to place a loan on non accrual status with respect to interest income recognition when collection of the interest is uncertain 
generally  this occurs when principal or interest payments are days or more past due  although interest accruals may continue in limited situations when loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
the classification of a loan as non accruing does not necessarily indicate that the principal and interest ultimately will be uncollectible 
the company s historical experience indicates that a portion of assets so classified will eventually be recovered 
all non performing loans are in various stages of workout  settlement or foreclosure 
other real estate includes properties acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and properties secured by loans classified as in substance foreclosures 
at december   non performing assets totaled million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at december  the  or increase in non performing assets in consisted of a million increase in other real estate properties  partially offset by a  decrease in non performing loans 
the increase in other real estate consists primarily of increases in commercial properties of million and residential properties of  before the allowance for losses 
the decrease in non performing loans was primarily attributable to a million decrease in non accrual commercial loans mostly due to properties transferred to other real estate during the year  partially offset by a million increase in non performing residential loans 
the comparatively lower level of non performing residential mortgage loans at year end reflected the continuing effect of the bulk sales in late the following table sets forth information with respect to non performing assets  the allowance for loan losses  and certain asset quality ratios at or for the years ended december dollars in thousands non performing loans mortgage loans residential properties      commercial properties     construction and land    other loans total non performing loans      other real estate  net     total non performing assets      allowance for loan losses at end of year      ratios allowance for loan losses to non performing loans total loans non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets net charge offs to average loans includes loans on non accrual status of million  million  million  million and million at december     and  respectively 
the remaining balance consists of loans greater than days past due and still accruing 
the company generally stops accruing interest on loans that are delinquent over days 
the loan portfolio also includes certain restructured loans that are current in accordance with modified payment terms and  accordingly  are not included in the preceding table 
these restructured loans are loans for which concessions  including reduction of interest rates to below market levels or deferral of payments  have been granted due to the borrowers financial condition 
restructured loans totaled  million and million at december   and  respectively 
if interest payments on non accrual and restructured loans at december had been made during the respective years in accordance with the original contractual loan terms  additional interest income of approximately   and million would have been recognized in  and  respectively 
at december   management has also identified approximately million in potential problem loans which represent loans having more than normal credit risk 
although these loans are currently performing at december   management believes that if economic conditions deteriorate in the company s lending area  some of these loans could become non performing in the future 
the moderate stability in the local economy and certain sectors of the real estate market over the past several years have contributed to the generally positive trends in the company s asset quality 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans at year end rose to in  compared to in and in as a percentage of total loans at year end  the allowance for loan losses was in  compared to in and in effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
sfas no 
requires lenders to measure impaired loans based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
generally  the company s impaired loans are considered to be collateral dependent 
an allowance for loan impairment is maintained if the measure of an impaired loan is less than its recorded investment 
adjustments to the allowance are made through corresponding charges or credits to the provision for loan losses 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s recorded investment in impaired loans consisted of non accrual commercial mortgage and construction loans totaling  at december  and million at december  total impaired loans at december  consist of i loans of  for which there was an allowance for loan impairment of  determined in accordance with sfas no 
and ii loans of  for which such an allowance was not required due to the adequacy of related collateral values and prior charge offs 
for the years ended december  and  the average recorded investment in total impaired loans was million and million  respectively 
interest income on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis and was not significant for and in the fourth quarter of  the company decided to dispose of certain troubled assets on a bulk sale basis in order to accelerate the reduction in loan portfolio credit risk  enhance overall asset quality and better position the company to achieve its strategic goals 
these transactions resulted in the sale of assets totaling million  which consisted of i non performing mortgage loans of million  ii performing mortgage loans of million with relatively high credit risk  and iii other real estate of million 
the net sales proceeds totaled million  resulting in losses of million which were charged to the allowance for loan losses million and the allowance for losses on other real estate 
liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet all present and future funding commitments 
management monitors the company s liquidity position on a daily basis and evaluates its ability to meet depositor withdrawals and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the asset liability management committee  consisting of members of senior management  is responsible for setting general guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
the mix of liquid assets and various deposit products  at any given time  reflects management s view of the most efficient use of these sources of funds 
the company s cash flows are classified according to their source operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
for  net cash of million was provided by operating activities 
net cash of million was used in investing activities  which primarily consisted of disbursements for security purchases and loan originations  partially offset by loan principal collections  proceeds from payments  maturities and calls of securities and proceeds from sales of loans 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  which consisted primarily of a net increase in deposits attributable to the purchase of branches  partially offset by deposit outflows  treasury stock purchases and cash dividends 
further details concerning the company s cash flows are provided in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
liquid assets are provided by short term investments  proceeds from maturities of securities and principal collections on loans 
one measure used by the company to assess its liquidity position is the primary liquidity ratio defined as the ratio of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and securities maturing within one year to total assets 
at december   the company had a primary liquidity ratio of as compared to at december an important source of funds is pawling s core deposit base 
management believes that a substantial portion of pawling s deposits of million at december  are core deposits 
core deposits are generally considered to be a highly stable source of liquidity due to the long term relationships with deposit customers 
pawling recognizes the importance of maintaining and enhancing its reputation in the consumer and commercial markets to enable effective gathering and retention of core deposits 
the company does not currently utilize brokered deposits as a source of funds 
in addition to the funding sources discussed above  the company has the ability to borrow funds from several sources 
pawling is a member of the fhlbny and  at december   had immediate access to additional liquidity in the form of borrowings from the fhlbny of up to million 
the company also has access to the discount window of the federal reserve bank 
there were no borrowings from these sources in  and  other than short term purchases of federal funds from the fhlbny 
at december   pawling had outstanding loan commitments and unadvanced customer lines of credit totaling million 
these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since certain of these instruments may expire without being funded and others may not be fully drawn upon 
the sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet the company s other obligations 
capital progressive  as a bank holding company  is subject to regulation and supervision by the frb which applies various guidelines in assessing the adequacy of capital and in analyzing applications to the frb 
under the current leverage capital guidelines of the frb  most bank holding companies must maintain consolidated tier capital of of total assets 
tier capital consists of common shareholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less substantially all intangible assets  identified losses and investments in certain subsidiaries 
the frb has also adopted a set of risk based capital adequacy guidelines  which require bank holding companies to maintain capital according to the risk profile of their asset portfolios and certain off balance sheet items 
the guidelines set forth a system for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning assets and credit equivalent amounts for certain off balance sheet items to one of four broad risk weight categories 
the amount of risk weighted assets is determined by applying a specific percentage   or  depending on the level of credit risk to the amounts assigned to each category 
as a percentage of risk weighted assets  a minimum ratio of must be maintained for tier capital and for total capital 
at december   progressive s consolidated capital ratios exceeded the frb s minimum regulatory capital requirements as follows risk based capital leverage capital tier total amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands actual    minimum requirement    excess    for all capital amounts  actual capital excludes the company s consolidated after tax net unrealized gain of  on securities available for sale other than a  unrealized loss on equity securities and intangible assets of million 
for total risk based capital  actual capital includes approximately million of the allowance for loan losses 
pawling  as a new york state chartered stock savings bank  is subject to regulation and supervision by the new york state banking department as its chartering agency and by the fdic as its deposit insurer 
fdic regulations require insured banks  such as pawling  to maintain minimum levels of capital 
the fdic regulations follow  in substance  the leverage and risk based capital requirements adopted by the frb for bank holding companies 
at december   pawling s capital ratios exceeded the fdic s minimum regulatory capital requirements as follows risk based capital leverage capital tier total amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands actual    minimum requirement    excess    for all capital amounts  actual capital excludes pawling s after tax net unrealized gain of  on securities available for sale and intangible assets of million 
for total risk based capital  actual capital includes approximately million of the allowance for loan losses 
during  the company announced two plans to repurchase in each case up to of progressive s outstanding common stock  to be used for general corporate purposes 
the first repurchase was completed in november and consisted of  shares at a total cost of million or per share 
the second repurchase plan was completed in september and consisted of  shares at a total cost of million or per share 
a third repurchase plan  which was announced in october and completed in july  consisted of  shares at a total cost of million or per share 
on october   the company announced a fourth plan to repurchase  shares  or approximately of outstanding stock  over a six to nine month period 
at december    shares had been purchased under the fourth plan at a cost of million or per share 
the number of shares and the per share cost of each repurchase program have been restated to reflect the three for two stock split 
asset liability management the company s net interest income is an important component of its operating results 
the stability of net interest income in changing interest rate environments depends on the company s ability to manage effectively the interest rate sensitivity and maturity of its assets and liabilities 
the company s asset liability management committee develops and implements risk management strategies  and uses various risk measurement tools to evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates on the company s asset liability structure and net interest income 
the company s asset liability management goal is to maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk to produce relatively stable net interest income in changing interest rate environments 
interest rate risk is managed primarily by structuring the company s balance sheet to emphasize holding adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and maintaining a large base of core deposits 
management s plan to shorten the maturities of the company s interest sensitive assets includes the further use of adjustable rate lending products  the sale of certain newly originated fixed rate mortgages  shortening the average maturity of the securities portfolio through the redeployment of maturing investments into adjustable rate securities and debt securities with maturities of no more than five years  and maintaining an appropriate balance between securities held to maturity and securities available for sale to provide management with flexibility to restructure the portfolio when conditions warrant 
as economic conditions change  management will modify the plan as necessary 
to date  the company has not used synthetic hedging instruments such as interest rate futures  swaps or options in managing its interest rate risk 
to emphasize the retention of assets with a shorter duration  the company s asset liability policy allows newly originated adjustable rate and biweekly payment mortgage loans to be held in its portfolio  while newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market 
at december   million or of the mortgage loan portfolio had adjustable rates  compared to million or at december  and million or at december  despite the benefits of adjustable rate loans to an institution s interest rate risk management  they may pose potential additional credit risks  because when interest rates rise the underlying payments by the borrower rise  increasing the potential for default 
one measure of the company s interest rate sensitivity is its interest sensitivity gap  or the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within a specified time frame 
shorter gaps are a measure of exposure to changes in interest rates for shorter intervals and longer gaps measure sensitivity over a longer interval 
at december   the company had a one year gap of of total assets  that is  it had an excess of interest bearing liabilities over interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year 
a negative gap may enhance earnings in periods of declining interest rates in that  during such periods  the interest expense paid on liabilities may decrease more rapidly than the interest income earned on assets 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  a negative gap may result in an increase in interest expense paid on liabilities that is greater than the increase in interest income earned on assets 
while a negative gap indicates the amount of interest bearing liabilities which may reprice before interest earning assets  it does not indicate the extent to which they will reprice 
therefore  at times  a negative gap may not produce higher margins in a declining rate environment 
due to the limitations inherent in the gap analysis  management augments the asset liability management process by using simulation analysis 
simulation analysis estimates the impact on net interest income of hypothetical changes in the balance sheet structure and or interest rate environment 
this analysis serves as an additional tool in meeting the company s goal of maintaining relatively stable net interest income in varying rate environments 
the following table summarizes the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  according to the time periods in which they are expected to reprice  and the resulting gap for each time period

non accrual loans are included in the table at their original maturities 
savings account repricings are based on the company s historical repricing experience and management s belief that these accounts are not highly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial information presented in this annual report have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services
