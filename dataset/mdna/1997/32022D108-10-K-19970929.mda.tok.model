liquidity and capital resources the bank is required to maintain levels of liquid assets as defined by the office of thrift supervision regulations 
this requirement is based on a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings and is currently 
the bank s liquidity ratio was at june  the bank s primary source of funds for meeting its liquidity needs are customer deposits  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  principal and interest payments from loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from the sale of investments  and earnings from operations retained by the corporation

the office of thrift supervision s capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three capital standards a tangible capital standard  a leverage core capital ratio  and an risk based capital standard 
as of june   the bank s actual capital percentages for tangible capital of  core capital of  and current risk based capital of  significantly exceed the regulatory requirement for each category 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the bank has an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on the bank s loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively

the reduced premium contributed approximately  net of tax  to earnings 
recent legislation required the bank to change its method of computing bad debt deductions for income tax purposes  effective july  formerly  the bank was permitted a bad debt deduction in the amount of of its pretax income 
the annual deductions created a bad debt reserve for income tax purposes 
this reserve resulted in a restriction upon retained earnings which subjected the reserve to tax recapture 
although the new law requires the recapture of post reserves  the bank has previously deferred the related tax consequences and therefore will have no material effect on the future earnings of the bank
