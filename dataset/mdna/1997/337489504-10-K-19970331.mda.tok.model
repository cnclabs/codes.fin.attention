inflation  economic conditions most of the company s leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenant s gross sales above predetermined levels  which rents generally increase as prices rise  or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

these types of tenants  in the experience of the company  generally maintain more consistent sales performance during periods of adverse economic conditions
