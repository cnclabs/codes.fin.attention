in addition  during the second half of fiscal  several of the company s senior executives resigned to pursue other opportunities 
in response to the financial results and other developments facing the business  the company developed a restructuring plan during the fourth fiscal quarter of the focus of the company s restructuring plan was to solidify its senior management team  reduce operating expenses through a reduction of its workforce and the closure of its cambridge  massachusetts  connecticut  london and innsbruck offices  consolidate software research and development activities in montreal  discontinue the air  pure  slice and diplomat product lines  and restructure its sales force to emphasize indirect sales channels 
while the company began implementation of its restructuring plan in the fourth fiscal quarter of and had substantially completed the implementation of the plan at the end of fiscal  the company still has approximately  in restructuring reserves primarily for the estimated cost of terminating leases  resolving outstanding severance issues  and the legal and taxation winding down of several subsidiaries

total revenues were  for the eleven month period ended june  and  for the year ended july  despite the fact that fiscal was an eleven month period  total revenues increased in fiscal over total revenues for fiscal due to new product offerings during the year  namely fire and flint rt  as well as wider acceptance of the company s premier resolution independent effects system  inferno  and a growing installed base 
revenues from flame systems  including software and hardware  were  of total revenues and  of total revenues for the eleven month period ended june  and the twelve month period ended july   respectively

due to the high average sales price  the timing of purchase orders and the lengthy sales cycle of vapour and frost systems  a limited number of sales of these systems could account for a significant amount of revenues

hardware only revenues  consisting primarily of the sale of disk arrays and other peripherals  were  of total revenues and  of total revenues for the eleven month period ended june  and the twelve month period ended july   respectively 
system revenues  which include software and hardware  were  of total revenues and  of total revenues for the eleven month period ended june  and the twelve month period ended july   respectively 
the fluctuations in software only  hardware only and system revenues are primarily due to the high average sales price of the company s products  such that a limited number of sales can account for a substantial portion of total revenues

the company s provision for income taxes was approximately  and  for the eleven month period ended june  and the twelve month period ended july   respectively 
the provision for all periods was based on the canadian federal statutory rate of and reflects the impact of various tax credits and foreign taxes

revenues in fiscal were also affected by a decline of in sales of flame systems  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decline in flame sales was offset by a increase in sales of flint systems  including software and hardware  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this continued growth in flint sales is primarily a result of the release of the indigo impact by sgi  the company s related release of the upgraded flint software  and continued market penetration 
although flint sales increased during fiscal  flint revenues were less than management s expectations  primarily due to the unavailability of sgi indigo impact texture memory to the company s distributors which caused customers to delay purchasing flint

quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth certain quarterly financial data for each of the eight most recent quarters in the period ended june   together with such data as a percentage of total revenues 
the quarterly information presented is unaudited 
in the opinion of management  the unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

litigation and related settlement expenses total operating expenses operating income loss total other income expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss the company s revenues and operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations 
a limited number of systems sales may account for a substantial percentage of the company s quarterly revenue due to of the high average sales price of such systems and the timing of purchase orders 
historically  the company has generally experienced greater revenues during the period following the completion of nab  which is typically held in april 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenues 
therefore  if revenue levels are below expectations  particularly following nab  the company s operating results are likely to be adversely affected  as was the case for the three month periods ended april  and july  in addition  the timing of revenue is influenced by a number of other factors  including the timing of individual orders and shipments  other industry trade shows  competition  seasonal customer buying patterns  changes in customer buying patterns in response to platform changes and changes in product development and sales and marketing expenditures 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  variations in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quarterly earnings shortfalls or losses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its profitability or avoiding losses in any future period 
the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through cash flow from operations including deferred revenue and customer deposits  borrowings under its demand line of credit  capital leases  the private and public sales of equity securities  and the receipt of research and development tax credits from the canadian federal government and the province of quebec

advances under these facilities accrue interest monthly at the canadian prime rate at june  plus 
the line and facilities are secured by essentially all of the company s north american assets 
as additional security  the company assigned to the bank its insurance on these assets 
the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios  including minimum levels of working capital  debt service coverage and equity to assets ratios 
as of june   there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit or the demand leasing and demand research and development tax credit facilities 
the company s operating activities  including research and development tax credits  provided cash of  used cash of  and provided cash of  in the eleven month period ended june   and the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
the principal sources of cash in the eleven month period ended june  were cash generated from operations  the decreases in inventory and in income taxes receivable  and the increases in accounts payable and accruals  deferred revenues and income taxes payable  offset by an increase in accounts receivable  when compared to the fiscal year ended july  accounts receivable increased during fiscal as a result of the company experiencing a greater level of sales and the timing of those sales being closer to the end of the fourth fiscal quarter as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of inventory decreased during fiscal  as a result of an aggressive sales program during the three month period ended october   including system discounting  designed to reduce the inventory on hand at the end of fiscal as well as close monitoring of inventory throughout the eleven month period ended june  accounts payable increased due to the increased level of hardware purchases required at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal to meet the quarter s revenue demands
