item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  net investment income and maturing investments 
the company generally experiences positive cash flow resulting from the fact that premiums are collected on insurance policies in advance of the disbursement of funds in payment of claims 
operating costs of the insurance subsidiaries  other than loss and loss expense payments and commissions paid to the parent company  generally average between and of premiums earned on a consolidated basis and the remaining amount is available for investment for varying periods of time depending on the type of insurance coverage provided 
during extended periods of declining premium volume  however  operating cash flows may turn negative as loss settlements exceed net premium revenue and receipts of investment income 
for several years  the company s investment philosophy has emphasized the purchase of short term instruments with maximum quality and liquidity 
as interest rates have remained relatively low and yield curves have been essentially flat in recent years  the company has not committed funds to longer term fixed maturity investments 
the average life of the company s bond and short term investment portfolio was years compared to years for the company also remains an active participant in the equity securities market 
investments made by the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries are regulated by guidelines promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners which are designed to provide protection for both policyholders and shareholders 
the company s assets at december  included million in short term investments which are readily convertible to cash without market penalty and an additional million of fixed maturity investments maturing in less than one year 
the company believes that these liquid investments  plus the expected cash flow from current operations  are more than sufficient to provide for projected claim payments and operating cost demands 
in addition  the company s reinsurance program is structured to avoid serious cash drains that might accompany catastrophic losses 
in the event competitive conditions continue to produce inadequate rates and the company chooses to further reduce volume  the company believes that the liquidity of its investment portfolio would permit it to continue to pay claims as settlements are reached without requiring the disposal of investments at a loss  regardless of interest rates in effect at the time 
net premiums written by the company s us insurance subsidiaries for were approximately of the combined statutory surplus of these subsidiaries 
premium writings of to of surplus are generally considered acceptable by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  the company has the ability to significantly increase its business without seeking additional capital to meet statutory guidelines 
consolidated shareholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december  in addition to current year earnings  this increase includes a million increase in unrealized net gains on the company s investment portfolio from million at december  to million at december  the increase in shareholders equity is net of million in treasury share purchases and million of dividends to shareholders 
book value per common share outstanding increased to at december  from per share at december  as more fully discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements  at december   million  or of consolidated shareholders equity  represented net assets of the company s insurance subsidiaries which  at that time  could not be transferred in the form of dividends  loans or advances to the parent company due to statutory restrictions on the allowable transfers 
however  management believes that these restrictions pose no material liquidity concerns for the company 
the financial strength and stability of the subsidiaries permit ready access by the parent company to short term and long term sources of credit 
the parent company had cash and marketable investments of approximately million at december  results of operations note all comparative amounts in the following discussion  for the year  have been adjusted to reflect the sale of hoosier insurance company during see note a for more information with respect to this sale 
compared to direct premiums written for totaled million  a decrease of million from this decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in the majority of the company s trucking related products

premium writings for protective s work accident program also decreased by million from  reflecting rate reductions on renewed accounts 
decreases in premium writings were also derived from sagamore s program for small trucking fleet risks and surety premiums related to large fleet risks of 
million each 
the above decreases were partially offset by an increase in sagamore s non standard private passenger automobile business of million from in addition  premiums for retrospectively rated workers compensation policies increased million reflecting loss development on prior year policies 
premium writings from reinsurance assumed decreased by million to million during this decrease relates principally to a million reduction in premiums assumed from voluntary property catastrophe retrocession pools  to million  during the lower catastrophe assumed premium is attributable to withdrawal from certain markets by the ceding reinsurers as the result of declining premium rates

the consolidated savings on all prior year losses was million for compared to million for adjusted for the development on environmental liability claims  savings on prior accident year losses were million and million during and  respectively 
these savings related predominantly to the company s trucking and trucking related business 
because of the high limits provided by the company to its insureds  the length of time required to settle larger  more complex claims and the volatility of the trucking liability insurance business  the company believes it is important to have a high degree of comfort in its reserving process 
as claims are settled in years subsequent to their occurrence  the company s claim handling process has  in recent years  tended to produce savings from the reserves provided 
the company believes that the favorable loss development may be attributable  at least in part  to changes in trucking safety in general resulting from the implementation of the national commercial driver license  mandatory drug testing and an increased awareness by trucking companies of the cost of unsafe operations 
it is further believed that the company s selection techniques  minimum safety standards and claims handling have also contributed to the current favorable loss experience 
the company has established provisions for incurred but not reported environmental losses at december  which are believed to be sufficient to cover all anticipated exposure

federal income tax considerations the liability method is used in accounting for federal income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the provision for deferred federal income tax was based on items of income and expense that were reported in different years in the financial statements and tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the difference originated 
net deferred tax liabilities of million and 
million were recorded at december  and  respectively 
the net deferred tax liability at december  included million in special tax deposits covered under section of the internal revenue code  as explained in the following paragraph  which compares to million in special tax deposits at december  adjusted for the special deposits  a net deferred tax liability of million was recorded at december  compared to a net deferred tax liability of million at december  the increase in deferred federal taxes payable is attributable to changes in unrealized capital gains in the investment portfolio 
a provision in the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of created a mechanism which would allow for a recognizable deferred tax asset specifically for property and casualty loss reserves discounted for tax purposes 
adopted as section of the internal revenue code  this provision allows an insurer to take a special tax deduction equal to the discount on post accident year loss and loss expense reserves while making special estimated tax payments equal to the amount of the tax benefit derived from the special deduction 
the special estimated tax payments can be carried forward for fifteen years to offset taxes arising from decreases in the special deduction and can be treated as regular estimated payments or refunded at the end of the carryforward period 
based upon the concerns regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets  the company adopted the provisions of section for all tax years and subsequent and has taken deductions for the entire amount of discount on post loss reserves 
as mentioned above  special section estimated tax deposits totaling million have been paid in connection with this election 
impact of inflation to the extent possible  the company attempts to recover the costs of inflation by increasing the premiums it charges 
a majority of the company s premiums are charged as a percentage of an insured s gross revenue or payroll 
as these charging bases increase with inflation  so does premium 
the remaining premium rates charged are adjustable only at periodic intervals and often require state regulatory approval 
such periodic increases in premium rates may lag far behind cost increases 
to the extent inflation influences yields on investments  the company is also affected 
the company maintains a sizable portion of its investment portfolio in short term instruments and changes in current market interest rates correspondingly affect yields on these investments 
further  as inflation affects current market rates of return  previously committed investments may rise or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of investment 
inflation must also be considered by the company in the creation and review of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves since portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the importance of continually adjusting reserves is even more pronounced in a period of extreme inflationary pressure
