item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and background the company s sales and net income increased significantly through primarily as a result of its acquisitions 
following each acquisition  the company implemented programs to take advantage of distribution and operating synergies among its businesses 
this implementation was reflected in increases in the company s sales and in the decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of the company s sales 
from mid through the end of  sales of most of the company s products were adversely affected by the worldwide slowdown in the electronic components industry  which reflected general recessionary trends in all major industrialized countries 
in addition  sales to defense related industries declined from the end of the first quarter of until the second half of despite this slowdown  vishay realized record net earnings in each year throughout this period 
this was a result of its acquisitions and focus on the bottom line  including the implementation of operating efficiencies 
in  the company s growth was fueled not only by its acquisition of vitramon  but also by the dramatic expansion in the electronic components industry 
this resulted in vishay s record net earnings of million in however  beginning with the last quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of  the company has experienced a decline in demand for its products  resulting in a decrease in revenues  earnings and backlogs 
the company believes this may be primarily a result of the worldwide slowdown in demand for tantalum and multi layer ceramic chip capacitors  the economic downturn in germany  where a significant portion of the company s products are sold  and the abrupt worldwide decline in demand for passive electronic components by personal computer and telecommunications manufacturers 
in order to address the slowdown in demand  the company implemented a restructuring program in that included the downsizing and closing of manufacturing facilities in north america and europe 
in connection with the restructuring  the company incurred  of pretax charges for the year ended december  relating to employee termination and facility closure costs 
when the restructuring program is fully implemented  the company believes that by reducing overhead costs and improving manufacturing efficiency  it will reduce costs by approximately million per year 
depending on future economic conditions  the company may continue to downsize or close existing facilities in north america  europe or elsewhere 
the company s strategy contemplates transferring some of its manufacturing operations from countries with high labor costs and tax rates such as the united states  france and germany to israel  mexico  portugal and the czech republic in order to benefit from lower labor costs and  in the case of israel  to take advantage of various government incentives  including government grants and tax incentives 
the company may further reduce its costs in the face of a decline in demand by accelerating the transfer of production to countries with lower labor costs and more favorable tax environments 
the company realizes approximately of its revenues outside the united states 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can significantly affect the company s reported sales and to a lesser extent earnings 
currency fluctuations impact the company s net sales and other income statement amounts  as denominated in us dollars  including other income as it relates to foreign exchange gains or losses 
generally  in order to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on profits  the company endeavors to i borrow money in the local currencies and markets where it conducts business  and ii minimize the time for settling intercompany transactions 
the company does not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures 
as a result of the increased production by the company s operations in israel over the past several years  the low tax rates in israel as compared to the statutory rate in the united states have had the effect of increasing the company s net earnings 
the more favorable israeli tax rates are applied to specific approved projects and normally continue to be available for a period of ten years or  if the investment in the project is over million  for a period of years  which has been the case for most of the company s projects in israel since new projects are continually being introduced 
in addition  the israeli government offers certain incentive programs in the form of grants designed to increase employment in israel 
however  the israeli government has recently scaled back or discontinued some of its incentive programs 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new incentive programs applicable to the company or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits the company has historically received or that the company will continue to be eligible to take advantage of them 
although the company might be materially adversely affected if these incentive programs were no longer available to the company for new projects  because a majority of the company s projects in israel already benefit from government incentive programs  the company does not anticipate that any cutbacks in the incentive programs would have an adverse impact on its earnings and operations for at least several years 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction of costs of products sold  were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the prior year 
to the extent the israeli government continues its grant and incentive programs  future benefits offered to the company by the israeli government will likely depend on the company s continuing to increase capital investment and the number of the company s employees in israel 
results of operations income statement captions as a percentage of sales and the effective tax rates were as follows year ended december  costs of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income earnings before income taxes effective tax rate net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  decreased  or from the prior year 
the decrease in net sales is indicative of the worldwide slowdown in the demand for tantalum and multi layer ceramic chip capacitors  the economic downturn in germany  where a significant portion of the company s products are sold  and the abrupt worldwide decline in demand for passive electronic components by personal computer and telecommunications manufacturers  which started at the end of the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year resulted in a decrease in reported sales of  net sales  exclusive of foreign currency fluctuations  decreased over the prior year 
costs of products sold for the year ended december  were of net sales  as compared to for the prior year 
costs of products sold for the year ended december  were negatively affected by  among other things  a difficult pricing environment and start up costs of the company s new capacitor plant in israel 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction of costs of products sold  were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the prior year 
to the extent the israeli government continues these grant and incentive programs  future benefits offered to the company by the israeli government will likely depend on the company s continuing to increase capital investment and the number of the company s employees in israel 
deferred income at december  relating to israeli government grants was  as compared to  at december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were of net sales  as compared to for the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses have decreased by  as compared to the prior year  as a result of a cost reduction program instituted in the fourth quarter  lower sales and a reduction in management incentives 
the company incurred a pretax restructuring charge of  for the year ended december  approximately  of those charges relate to employee termination costs covering approximately  technical  production  administrative and support employees located in the united states  canada  france and germany 
as of december   approximately  employees had been terminated and  of the termination costs were paid 
the remaining  of restructuring expense relates to facility closure costs in north america and europe 
the restructuring plan is expected to be completed by the end of the company has sufficient lines of credit to fund these payments 
depending on future economic conditions  the company may continue to downsize or close existing facilities in north america  europe or elsewhere 
when fully implemented  the restructuring is expected to reduce the company s costs by approximately  annually 
interest costs decreased by  for the year ended december  from the prior year primarily as a result of the net proceeds of  from a common stock offering completed in september which were used  in large part  to prepay bank indebtedness 
other income expense increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to foreign exchange gains of  for the year ended december  as compared to foreign exchange losses of  for the year ended december the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the continuing effect of low tax rates in israel as compared to the statutory rate in the united states has been to increase net earnings by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the more favorable israeli tax rates are applied to specific approved projects and normally continue to be available for a period of ten years 
the israeli tax effect benefit was more pronounced in primarily as a result of increased proportional earnings in israel 
see description of business manufacturing operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased  or from the prior year 
the increase reflects the strong performance of vitramon  acquired july   and vishay s other surface mount components businesses 
net sales for the year ended december  includes  of net sales relating to vitramon for the first six months of the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year resulted in an increase in reported sales of  net sales  exclusive of foreign currency fluctuations  increased over the prior year

net bookings for the year ended december  increased over the prior year 
costs of products sold for the year ended december  were  of net sales  as compared to for the prior year 
the factors contributing to this decrease included i the effect of the mexican peso devaluation  which contributed approximately  to gross profit for  ii the fact that gross profits for vitramon were higher than vishay s other operating companies  iii israeli government grants of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the prior year  and iv an increase in production in israel where labor costs are lower than in most other regions in which vishay manufactures 
the increase in israeli government grants resulted from a significant increase in the company s manufacturing operations in israel 
deferred income at december  relating to israeli government grants was  selling  general  and administrative expenses  for the year ended december  were of net sales  as compared to for the prior year 
management continues to explore additional cost saving opportunities 
restructuring expenses of  in resulted from downsizing of some of the company s european operations and represent employee termination benefits covering approximately technical  production  administrative and support employees located primarily in france and germany 
this downsizing was completed during the year ended december  interest costs increased by  for the year ended december  over the prior year as a result of an increase in average debt outstanding resulting from the acquisition of vitramon in july and purchases of property and equipment 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the prior year 
the higher effective tax rate for reflects increased earnings in higher tax rate countries 
the effect of low tax rates in israel as compared to the statutory rate in the united states has been to increase net earnings by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the israeli tax effect was more pronounced in primarily as a result of increased earnings for the israeli operations as a result of increased production

inflation normally  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company s products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  can be adjusted to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by the company  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on behalf of the company  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company offers a broad variety of products and services to its customers 
changes in demand for  or in the mix of  products and services comprising revenues could cause actual operating results to vary from those expected 
the company s future operating results are dependent  in part  on its ability to develop  produce and market new and innovative products  to convert existing products to surface mount devices and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this complex process  including rapid technological changes and the need for the company to timely bring to market new products and applications to meet customers changing needs 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment  which includes significant competitive pricing pressures and intense competition for entry into new markets 
a slowdown in demand for passive electronic components or recessionary trends in the global economy in general or in specific countries or regions where the company sells the bulk of its products  such as the us  germany  france or the pacific rim  could adversely impact the company s results of operations 
many of the orders in the company s backlog may be canceled by its customers without penalty 
customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to insure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long 
the company s results of operations may be adversely impacted if customers were to cancel a material portion of such orders 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from operations and sales outside the united states 
as a result  currency exchange rate fluctuations  inflation  changes in monetary policy and tariffs  potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s business in foreign jurisdictions  trade restrictions or prohibitions  intergovernmental disputes  increased labor costs and reduction or cancellation of government grants  tax benefits or other incentives could impact the company s results of operations 
specifically  as a result of the increased production by the company s operations in israel over the past several years  the low tax rates in israel as compared to the statutory rates in the us have had the effect of increasing the company s net earnings 
in addition  the company takes advantage of certain incentive programs in israel in the form of grants designed to increase employment in israel 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of any of the israeli grant programs such as described in description of business manufacturing operations could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company may experience underutilization of certain plants and factories in high labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in low labor cost regions  resulting initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
such costs include those associated with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions as described in the introduction and background to this item and start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the start of production in new plants and expansions in lower labor cost regions 
moreover  capacity constraints may limit the company s ability to continue to meet demand for any of the company s products 
when the company restructures its operations in response to changing economic conditions  particularly in europe  labor unrest or strikes may occur  which could have an adverse effect on the company 
the company s results of operations may be adversely impacted by i difficulties in obtaining raw materials  supplies  power  natural resources and any other items needed for the production of the company s products  ii the effects of quality deviations in raw materials  particularly tantalum powder  palladium and ceramic dielectric materials  and iii the effects of significant price increases for tantalum or palladium  or an inability to obtain adequate supplies of tantalum or palladium from the limited number of suppliers 
the company s historic growth in revenues and net earnings have resulted in large part from its strategy to expand through acquisitions 
however  there is no assurance that the company will find or consummate transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
from time to time  when the company is in the process of pursuing a strategic acquisition  the company or the acquisition target may feel compelled for securities and other legal reasons to announce the potential acquisition or the company s desire to enter into a certain market prior to entering into formal agreements 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will consummate any such acquisition 
the company s strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales offices and administrative functions at acquired companies and achievement of significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to lower cost regions such as israel  mexico  portugal and the czech republic 
the company s inability to achieve any of these goals could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company may be adversely affected by the costs and other effects associated with i legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil  such as environmental and product related  or criminal  ii settlements  investigations  claims  and changes in those items  iii developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses  and iv adoption of new  or changes in  accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices 
the company s results of operations may also be affected by i changes within the company s organization  particularly at the executive officer level  or in compensation and benefit plans  and ii the amount  type and cost of the financing which the company maintains  and any changes to the financing 
the inherent risk of environmental liability and remediation costs associated with the company s manufacturing operations may result in large and unforeseen liabilities 
the company s operations may be adversely impacted by i the effects of war or severe weather or other acts of god on the company s operations  including disruptions at manufacturing facilities  ii the effects of a disruption in the company s computerized ordering systems  and iii the effects of a disruption in the company s communications systems
