assumptions underlying certain forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results in the next few years  the company expects growth in both revenues and profits to continue at rates higher than the estimated industry growth rate of percent source dataquest  although not at the exceptional rates posted in fiscal and fiscal the foregoing statement contains  and other information and statements provided by the company from time to time may contain  forward looking information 
such forward looking information may include information relating to anticipated growth in earnings per share  anticipated returns on equity  anticipated growth in revenue  growth of client base  anticipated operating costs and employment growth  anticipated reserves or other expenses  or other matters 
the cautionary statements provided below are being made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra for any such forward looking information 
many of the following factors discussed below  as well as other factors  have also been discussed in prior filings made by the company 
factors which could cause the company s actual financial and other results to differ materially from any results that might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to the following rapid technological change the systems consulting and implementation market has experienced rapid technological advances and developments in recent years 
failure of the company to stay abreast of such advances and developments could materially adversely affect its business 
the company additionally utilizes a number of different technologies in developing and providing it solutions for its customers 
the technologies used by the company are developing rapidly and are characterized by evolving industry standards in a wide variety of areas 
while the company evaluates technologies on an ongoing basis and endeavors to utilize those that are most effective in developing it solutions for its customers  there can be no assurance that the technologies utilized by the company and the expertise gained in those technologies will continue to be applicable in the future 
there can be no assurance that new technologies will be made available to the company or that such technologies page can be economically applied by the company 
the inability to apply existing technologies and expertise to subsequent projects could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
management of growth the company s business has grown significantly since its inception  and the company anticipates future growth 
the growth of the company s business and the expansion of its customer base have resulted in a corresponding growth in the demands on the company s management and personnel and its operating systems and internal controls 
any future growth may further strain existing management resources and operational  financial  human and management information systems and controls  which may not be adequate to support the company s operations 
the company is currently increasing its expense levels as a result of a number of factors  including substantial increases in the number of employees  the opening of new offices  investments in equipment  training of employees and the development of methodologies  tools  etc 
an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing and other expenses  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its recent or future growth successfully 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow or sustain the rate of growth it has experienced in the past 
the company expects that it will need to develop further its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures to accommodate future growth 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop such controls  systems or procedures effectively or on a timely basis  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
ability to attract and retain employees the company s business consists mainly of professional services and is inherently labor intensive 
the company s success depends in large part upon its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly senior project managers and other senior personnel  for its domestic and international operations 
qualified senior project managers within and outside the united states are in particularly great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
several attributes of the company s work environment pose challenges to the company s ability to attract and retain employees  including  i extensive travel requirements  ii the company s intense work environment and culture  iii the company s standards for employee technical skills and job performance and iv the company s practice of adjusting the number of technical personnel to reflect active project levels 
although the company expects to continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and to retain its existing senior project managers and other senior personnel for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
page growth by acquisition the company may grow in part by acquiring existing businesses 
the success of this plan depends upon  among other things  the ability of the company and its management to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into its organization effectively  to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired firms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  consummate acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations into the company 
in addition  acquisitions by the company may involve certain other risks  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
dependence on key personnel although the company does not believe that the loss of any particular individual would have a material adverse impact on the company  the loss of some or all of the company s senior managers could have a material adverse impact on the company  including its ability to secure and complete engagements 
the company has employment agreements with its president  executive vice presidents and its vice presidents that contain noncompetition  nondisclosure and nonsolicitation covenants 
the employment agreements with the president and executive vice presidents do not have fixed expiration dates and may be terminated by either the company or the employee on days written notice 
the employment agreements with the other vice presidents generally have a fixed initial term but are automatically renewed for successively one year periods unless terminated by either the company or the employee on days written notice 
other senior employees also have employment agreements that are generally terminable by the company or the employee upon to days written notice 
unassigned labor costs the company s unassigned labor costs  which represent salaries of  and other expenses allocated to  systems professionals not assigned to a specific project  have gradually increased as a percentage of revenues over time 
the company attempts to reassign employees who meet its performance requirements to other active projects when they are no longer needed on a particular project 
however  since the company generally recruits personnel in advance of the commencement of certain projects in order to meet the needs of such projects  any cancellation or delays in the anticipated projects could increase the unassigned labor costs and might cause a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
cyclicality certain of the company s customers and potential customers are in industries that experience cyclical variations in profitability  which may in turn affect their willingness or ability to fund systems projects such as those for which the company may be engaged 
the company s experience indicates  however  that competitive pressures in cyclical industries sometimes compel businesses to undertake systems projects even during periods of losses or reduced profitability 
page quarterly results may fluctuate the company s results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors such as differences in the number of billing days and or holidays between quarters  the number of vacation days and sick days taken by the company s employees in a particular quarter  and varying weather conditions 
these and other factors can reduce revenues in a given quarter with a corresponding adverse impact on the company s margins 
project risks because of the project based nature of the company s work and the fact that many of the projects undertaken by the company are large projects  there is a risk of a material adverse impact on operating results because of the unanticipated suspension or cancellation of a large project or the financial difficulties of a client 
the suspension or cancellation of a project or the financial difficulties of a client could result in a drop in revenues  the need to reassign staff  a potential dispute with a client regarding monies owed for consulting work and expenses  and a lessening of tsc s reputation 
in addition  because many of the company s projects are high profile  mission critical projects for major clients  a failure or inability to meet a client s expectations with respect to a major project undertaken by the company could damage its reputation and affect its ability to attract new business 
third party products and services are integral to the success of certain company projects 
to the extent that third parties do not deliver effective products and services on a timely basis  the company s project results could be negatively impacted 
although the company attempts to limit this risk in its engagement arrangements with clients and maintains errors and omissions insurance  the failure of a project could also result in significant financial exposure to the company 
competition the systems consulting and implementation market comprises a large number of participants  is subject to rapid changes and is highly competitive 
the company competes with and faces potential competition from a number of companies that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
the company also competes with smaller service providers whose specific  more narrowly focused service offerings may be more attractive to potential clients than the company s multi dimensional approach 
the company s clients primarily consist of fortune and other large corporations and there are an increasing number of professional services firms seeking systems consulting and implementation engagements from that client base 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside its control  including the ability of its competitors to hire  retain and motivate a significant number of senior project managers  the ownership by competitors of software used by potential clients  the development by others of software that is competitive with the company s products and services  and the price at which others offer comparable services 
in addition  the company s clients could develop or acquire in house expertise in services similar to those provided by the company  which would significantly reduce demand for the company s services 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to maintain its existing client page base  maintain or increase the level of revenue generated by its existing clients or be able to attract new clients 
susceptibility to general economic conditions the company s revenues and results of operations will be subject to fluctuations based on the general economic conditions of the united states as well as the foreign countries in which it operates 
if there were to be a general economic downturn or a recession in the united states or the foreign countries in which it operates  then the company expects that business enterprises would cut back their spending on  or reduce their budget for  it services 
in the event of such an economic downturn  there can be no assurance that the company s business  operating results and financial condition would not be materially and adversely affected 
cost overruns although the company s engagement contracts are generally on a time and materials basis  some of its contracts are on a not to exceed or fixed price basis 
the failure of the company to complete a project to the client s satisfaction within the not to exceed or fixed fee exposes the company to unrecoverable cost overruns  which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
intellectual property rights a majority of the company s customers have required the company  as a condition to performing services for such customers  to grant to the customer all proprietary and intellectual property rights with respect to the work product resulting from the performance of such services  including the intellectual property rights to any custom software developed by the company for such customer 
each such grant of proprietary and intellectual property rights would limit the company s ability to reuse work product components and work product solutions with other customers 
in a limited number of such situations  the company has obtained  and in the future may attempt to obtain  ownership interest or a license from its customer to permit the company to market custom software for the joint benefit of the customer and the company 
such arrangements may be nonexclusive or exclusive  and licensors to the company may retain the right to sell products and services that compete with those of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to negotiate licenses upon terms acceptable to the company 
the company also develops certain foundation and application software tools and products that are owned by the company and licensed to its clients 
the company regards such software as proprietary and protects its rights in such software where appropriate with copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure and transferring title 
to date  the company has not filed any applications for the registration of patents or copyrights on any of its software  although the company does presently hold certain registered trademarks for some of its software products 
there can be no assurance that any such steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary rights or independent third party development of functionally equivalent products 
page in addition  the company s success is dependent upon its specialized expertise and methodologies 
to protect such proprietary information  the company relies upon a combination of trade secret and common laws  employee nondisclosure policies and third party confidentiality agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that any such steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its specialized expertise and methodologies 
although the company believes that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted against the company in the future 
risks of conducting international operations the company has been significantly increasing its international operations in recent years and expects to continue to do so in the future 
because the cost of doing business abroad is higher for us businesses than the cost of doing business domestically  the company could experience a decline in its operating margins as the significance of its international operations increases 
international operations and the provision of services in foreign markets are subject to a number of special risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks  additional security concerns and risks of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
in addition  the company s continued success and future growth internationally will depend upon its ability to attract  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees in each of those foreign countries where it conducts operations 
competition for such local personnel qualified to deliver most of the company s services is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professionals to compete successfully internationally
