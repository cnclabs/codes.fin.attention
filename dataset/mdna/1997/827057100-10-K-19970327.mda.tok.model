item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled business  risk factors  and legal proceedings 
all of the company s products are currently manufactured through collaborative manufacturing relationships with two semiconductor manufacturers sanyo and winbond 
to date  the company has obtained the majority of its wafers from sanyo 
the company s orders from these manufacturers are based upon existing and forecasted customer demand 
as demand for the company s products has increased  the company has been unable to obtain its desired allotment of wafers 
the company is in the process of transitioning production of its primary superflash products to smaller geometries  thereby increasing the number of usable die per wafer that the company receives from its manufacturers 
the company has entered into agreements with seiko epson and tsmc to obtain additional wafer manufacturing capacity 
bringing a new manufacturer up to full volume production is a complex procedure and there can be no assurance that either seiko epson or tsmc will be able to achieve volume production in a timely fashion or that either seiko epson or tsmc will allocate sufficient production capacity to the company 
average selling prices have declined significantly over the past year and average selling prices of semiconductor products have generally declined over time and are expected to decline in the future  principally due to increased market competition 
specifically  industry overcapacity during has resulted in higher than normal price declines in the company s markets  which has unfavorably impacted the company s revenues  gross margins  and profitability 
the company expects this price erosion may continue for some time 
the company is attempting to accelerate its cost reduction efforts and to develop new products to expand and diversify the company s application and geographic base 
if such activities can not be implemented in a timely manner to offset anticipated declines in average selling prices  losses may result and liquidity may be impacted 
during  the company derived approximately of its product revenues from sales to taiwan based pc manufacturers 
the company intends to diversify its customer base by increasing sales in other geographic areas and targeting additional high volume applications such as the cellular telephone  cd rom drive  hard disk drive  video game  electronic organizer and set top box markets 
the company anticipates that as sales in japan  the united states and europe increase  overall days sales outstanding will increase 
during  and respectively  international sales accounted for approximately or million  or million  and or million of the company s net revenues  respectively 
the company is in the process of increasing the scope of its international operations and expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its product revenues although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
although the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  these sales are subject to a number of risks associated generally with international sales  including the effect of currency fluctuations  state imposed restrictions on the repatriation of funds  import and export duties and restrictions 
results of operations years ended december   and net revenues 
net revenues increased from million in to million in to million in  due to increased units shipped of the company s products 
the company began recognizing product revenue in june product revenues were million in  increasing to million in and million in these increases were primarily the result of increased market acceptance of the company s mbit superflash memory products  and to a lesser extent the introduction of the company s new mbit product in and first kbit product in and mbit product in product revenue is typically recognized upon shipment to manufacturing customers 
sales to distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold by the distributors 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and future returns  the company defers recognition of such revenues  related cost of revenues and related gross margin until the merchandise is sold by the distributors to the end user 
the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent upon its ability to increase unit sales volumes and decrease manufacturing costs of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in average selling prices 
the company s ability to increase its unit sales volumes depends on the capacity of its manufacturers representatives and distributors to generate orders  increasing its wafer capacity allocation from current foundries  improving the yield of die per wafer from its foundries through reductions in the die size of the company s products  adding additional foundries and implementing advanced process technologies 
industry overcapacity during has resulted in higher than normal price declines in the company s markets  which has unfavorably impacted the company s revenues  gross margins  and profitability 
the company expects that this price erosion may continue for some time 
license revenues increased from  in to million in and million in license revenues in included a one time payment of million from rockwell international corporation and license revenues in included a one time payment of million from seiko epson 
most of the company s technology licenses provide for the payment of upfront license fees and continuing royalties based on product sales 
revenue from license or other technology arrangements is recognized upon the shipment of the product or documentation if the remaining obligations are insignificant and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is probable 
the company anticipates that license revenues will fluctuate significantly in the future 
revenue from best efforts joint development contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenues 
gross margin was  in  million or of net revenues in  and million or of net revenues in the fluctuations in gross margins between through were primarily a function of changes in the mix between license revenues and product revenues 
in  gross margin was further impacted by higher manufacturing costs associated with the company s mbit product and ramp up costs for its mbit product absorbed by a relatively small number of mbit unit sales 
future fluctuations in gross margins may occur as a result of changes in the mix between license revenues and product revenues or the impact of changes in product mix 
year to year fluctuations in gross margin during through were not necessarily reflective of quarterly results during this period 
refer to item selected consolidated quarterly data for a discussion of quarterly results 
the company s agreement with sanyo provides for wafer price adjustments based on dollar yen exchange rate fluctuations 
as a result  a strengthening yen could result in higher cost of revenues 
gross margins may also be affected by cost reductions  yield fluctuations  wafer costs  changes in product mix  the mix of sales through distribution channels and competitive pricing pressures 
gross margin 
average selling prices of flash memory products are subject to significant fluctuations due to periodic changes in supply and demand 
declining average selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless the company is able to offset such declines with reductions in per unit costs or changes in product mix 
specifically  industry overcapacity during has resulted in higher than normal price declines in the markets to which the company sell 
this significant price erosion has unfavorably impacted the company s revenues  gross margins and profitability during recent quarters 
operating expenses 
operating expenses research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of product revenues declined from of product revenues million in to of product revenues million in due to increasing sales volumes 
this decrease of operating expenses as a percentage of product revenues from year to year is not necessarily indicative of future behavior of operating expenses as a percentage of product revenues  operating expenses may increase as a percentage of product revenues in the future 
operating expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollar amount over time  primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel and development of the company s infrastructure 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million or of net revenues in  million or or net revenues in  and million or of net revenues in these year over year increases in the level of research and development expense were primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel  depreciation related to purchases of additional test equipment  and increased prototyping and product qualification costs associated with the company s product and process development efforts 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million or of net revenues in  million or of net revenues in  and million or of net revenues in sales and marketing expense consists primarily of sales commissions to manufacturers representatives  salaries of the company s sales and marketing personnel and product literature 
the significant increase in sales and marketing expenses during and was primarily due to increases in sales commissions to manufacturers representatives and costs associated with the company s product data books 
historically  a majority of the company s product revenues have been generated through manufacturers representatives 
manufacturers representatives are expected to continue to be responsible for a majority of the company s product revenues for the foreseeable future  but the company anticipates an increase in the volume of distributor sales 
the company s sales commission structure for its manufacturers representatives decreases as manufacturers representatives achieve higher levels of sales activities within a given year 
accordingly  the company expects that sales commissions to manufacturers representatives will decrease as a percentage of product revenues as cumulative yearly product revenues increase 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were  or of net revenues in  million or of net revenues in  and million or of net revenues in these increases in the level of general and administrative expenses were primarily to support the higher level of operations 
the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amount 
additionally  it is reasonably possible that the company may incur additional expenses in connection with the atmel litigation 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was  or of net revenues in   or of net revenues in  and million or of net revenues in interest income increased during through as working capital increased  particularly as a result of the investment of proceeds from the company s initial public offering in late interest expense 
interest expense was  or of net revenues in and  or of net revenues in there was no interest expense in the interest expense in and was primarily due to borrowings against the company s line of credit facility in order to finance equipment purchases 
the decrease in interest expense in and was primarily due to payments made which decreased corporate debt during all such long term debt was repaid as of december  provision for benefit from income taxes 
the company s provision for benefit from income taxes was  in   in  and million in the provision for income taxes in was primarily the result of japanese taxes withheld on license revenues 
at december   the company had federal and state net operating losses relating to prior years of approximately million and million  respectively  which were utilized against taxable income during the benefit in relates to the recording of a deferred tax asset by the company during the fourth quarter which previously had been fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
during  the company was fully subject to federal and state income taxes

the company issued quantum corporation a million convertible debenture in december and another million convertible debenture in january the principal and accrued interest on the debentures were converted into approximately  shares of the company s common stock immediately prior to the completion of the offering and were sold as a part of the offering 
the company had no long term debt outstanding as of december  or the company made capital expenditures of approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily for the purchase of test equipment  design and engineering tools  and computer equipment 
during  the company resold certain equipment to its subcontractor in lingsen  taiwan  for proceeds of million 
management estimates that gross expenditures for capital equipment will be approximately million in in addition  the company may use its working capital to secure additional foundry capacity 
these expenditures may be in the form of deposits  equipment purchases  loans or equity investments or joint ventures in or with wafer fabrication or other companies 
in july  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
approximately  shares were repurchased under this authorization during august and september for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in february   the board of directors approved a second stock purchase program whereby up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock may be repurchased on the open market at prevailing market prices

the company had no open lines of credit at december  however  the company may elect to open a line to credit in the future to secure sufficient working capital to finance growth in operations 
the company believes that the cash balances  together with funds expected to be generated from operations may be sufficient to meet its projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
specifically  industry overcapacity during has resulted in higher than normal price declines in the company s markets  which has unfavorably impacted the company s revenues  gross margins  and profitability 
the company expects this price erosion may continue for some time 
the company is attempting to accelerate its cost reduction efforts and to develop new products to expand and diversify the company s application and geographic base 
if such activities can not be implemented in a timely manner to offset anticipated declines in average selling prices  losses may result and liquidity may be impacted
