item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital structure hub group  inc was incorporated on march  on march   hub group  inc purchased hub city terminals  inc 
hub chicago in a stock for stock acquisition through the issuance of  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock 
hub chicago has been accounted for similar to the pooling of interests method of accounting and has been included in all periods presented on a historical cost basis 
concurrent with the acquisition of hub chicago in march  hub group  inc completed the initial public offering of  shares of its class a common stock 
coincident with the initial public offering  a selling stockholder sold  shares of hub group  inc s class a common stock through a secondary offering 
business combinations concurrent with the initial public offering  hub group  inc  together with its wholly owned subsidiary  hub chicago  acquired a controlling interest in each of operating partnerships collectively referred to as hub partnerships 
prior to march   hub chicago and hub partnerships were under common control and formed a network that collectively worked with customers and vendors 
on may   hub group  inc purchased the rights to service the customers of american president lines domestic distribution services apldds  a division of apl land transport services  inc  from its parent american president companies  ltd 
the revenue of the acquired businesses is many multiples of the revenue of hub chicago 
as a result  consolidated revenue and operating expense for hub group  inc and its subsidiaries the company increased dramatically in the periods subsequent to march  as a result of the apldds acquisition  the company acquired the right to service apldds customers  but did not assume any assets or liabilities associated with that business 
furthermore  the company hired only of the more than employees in the apldds organization 
the apldds business was absorbed directly into the operations of hub chicago and hub partnerships and management believes the associated incremental operating costs are significantly less than the historical operating costs experienced by apldds 
management does not track the incremental purchased transportation and operating costs attributable to the acquired apldds business 
consequently  discussion of results of operations excluding acquisitions is limited to comparisons of revenue 
discussion of pro forma financial data reflects results of operations as if hub group  inc had acquired hub partnerships and apldds as of january  results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue revenue totaled million for  representing an increase of over without the acquisitions  company revenues totaled million for for an increase of over the minor increase in revenue without acquisitions is attributed principally to hub chicago s loss of a portion of a significant customer s business 
this consumer products manufacturer moved the production of one of its major products to a facility which is now being served by one of the operating partnerships that comprise hub partnerships 
pro forma revenue increased to million from million in the pro forma revenue was impacted significantly by the addition of the revenue reported by apldds 
the business acquired from apldds on may   had been experiencing significant decline during and the first quarter of this decline had a negative influence on the pro forma revenue growth rate 
despite the declining trend  management believes the company has successfully transitioned and retained greater than of the apldds business that existed on may  excluding the revenue relating to apldds prior to the acquisition on may   hub chicago and hub partnerships  on a combined basis assuming hub chicago had acquired hub partnerships on january   experienced a revenue increase of to million in from million in this percentage increase is primarily attributable to strong growth in truckload brokerage and logistics as well as the acquisition of the apldds business 
intermodal revenues  excluding apldds from all periods  increased moderately on a percentage basis 
net revenue net revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to for compared to in this increase is primarily a reflection of the higher net revenue as a percentage of revenue that is experienced by hub partnerships as compared to hub chicago 
hub chicago has a larger proportion of high volume low margin accounts than does hub partnerships 
pro forma net revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in on a pro forma basis  net revenue as a percentage of revenue for the apldds business was and for and the period january  through may   respectively 
management believes that the net revenue percentage on the transitioned apldds business has improved modestly over the apldds pro forma net revenue percentage 
the lower pro forma percentages experienced by apldds causes the current year percentages to compare favorably to the prior year percentages 
this favorable pro forma comparison is partially offset by the lower net revenue percentage experienced by the addition of new logistics customers in late and early salaries and benefits salaries and benefits increased to million in from million in pro forma salaries and benefits increased to million in from million in apldds was a division of apl land transport services  inc apl and consequently received much of its support services from apl 
in return for these services  apldds was assessed a management fee 
this arrangement had the effect of deflating salaries and benefits while inflating selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a result  salaries and benefits reported by apldds in servicing their customers were lower as a percentage of revenue than traditionally experienced by the company 
for and the period january  through may   salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue for apldds were and  respectively 
pro forma salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased to for from in  which is partially attributed to the historical cost structure of apldds 
the company s investment in additional personnel in also contributed to this increase 
these additional personnel were hired to handle additional truckload brokerage and logistics business  to expand the local and national sales forces and to provide the financial and administrative services required for continued growth 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue these pro forma expenses were in and for as explained in salaries and benefits  apldds received much of its support services through a management fee arrangement with apl 
this caused the apldds historical selling  general and administrative expenses to be a significantly greater percentage of revenue than the percentage traditionally experienced by the company 
for and the period january   through may   selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for apldds were and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from a negligible amount in pro forma depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  pro forma depreciation and amortization increased to in from in other income expense interest expense was million in and zero in all of the interest expensed in was incurred subsequent to march  pro forma interest expense increased to million in from million in there are three primary components of interest expense 
first  the company assumed or issued million of five year balloon notes in conjunction with the acquisition of hub partnerships in march these notes bear interest at an annual rate of 
interest expense on these notes began to decline in the third quarter of as discretionary payments were made 
second  in conjunction with the acquisition of apldds in may  the company issued notes for million bearing interest at an annual rate of 
there were no payments made on these notes in third  the company has borrowed to purchase tractors as it continues its strategy of starting small drayage operations to service portions of its own business in those areas where it is needed to enhance customer service see liquidity and capital resources 
the annual rate of interest on these loans is determined at the time each tractor is purchased at a rate equal to over the two year treasury note rate 
interest income was million in and million in pro forma interest income was million in and million in minority interest minority interest was million in and zero in on a pro forma basis  minority interest was million in and million in management estimates that of the acquired apldds business has accrued to hub chicago 
to calculate a pro forma minority interest factor  it was estimated that the minority interest will accrue its ownership in hub partnerships which operates of the apldds business 
as such  minority interest as a percentage of income before minority interest and provision for income taxes of was applied to pro forma income before minority interest for apldds for and the period january   through may  on a pro forma basis  minority interest as a percentage of income before minority interest and provision for income taxes was for and for the higher minority interest percentage in was the result of the significant loss reported by apldds combined with a lower pro forma minority interest factor that was applied to that loss as compared to the factor applied to the rest of the company s income

year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue revenue decreased to million in from million in approximately of the decrease resulted from a significant customer moving it headquarters and distribution facility out of hub chicago s territory and into the territory of one of the partnerships that comprise hub partnerships at the end of the fourth quarter of a slowdown in the economy in reduced shipments by the company s customers 
however  hub chicago had been increasingly successful in passing along to the customer  where appropriate  additional trailer storage and detention charges  many of which were formerly not billed by the company  thus offsetting to some extent the effects of the economic slowdown 
net revenue net revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to in compared to in in  the company was able to negotiate reduced freight charges with vendors due to the weakened demand for freight transportation 
management also believes that net revenue as a percentage of revenue in increased as a result of the continued improvement in the hubs ability to control equipment through the network the company shares with hub partnerships 
the company had also been successful in reducing trailer storage and detention charges that it previously absorbed 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits decreased million but increased slightly a percentage of revenues to of revenues in compared to of revenues in this increase in salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue was a result of a decrease in revenue

pro forma net income pro forma net income pro forma only regarding income taxes increased to million in from million in liquidity and capital resources during  the company had several significant transactions that affected liquidity 
these transactions were the initial public offering of the company s class a common stock and the subsequent acquisition of a controlling interest in hub partnerships  the apldds acquisition and the purchase of the remaining minority interest in hub tennessee and hub north central 
these items represented a cash inflow of million and cash outflows of million  million  million and zero  respectively

an additional million of miscellaneous debt was assumed in connection with the acquisition of hub partnerships

capital expenditures are principally made to enhance or expand the company s information systems and network capabilities and  most recently  to acquire a number of tractors to support company owned drayage operations 
part of the company s strategy is to supplement third party drayage operations with company owned tractors to service portions of the company s intermodal business in those locations where drayage service is limited or where customers require an enhanced level of service which cannot be competitively accommodated by a third party provider 
as of december   the company owned tractors as part of company owned drayage operations for the operating companies located in missouri  michigan  new jersey  georgia  kansas and illinois 
the company owned drayage operation in missouri has been functioning since the michigan operation started in the second quarter of  the new jersey and illinois operations started in the third quarter of and the georgia and kansas operations started in the fourth quarter of of the tractors in operation at december   were acquired in at a cost of approximately  each 
ten of these tractors were purchased with cash and the remainder were financed at a rate of over the two year treasury note rate after an initial down payment of 
the company maintains a bank line of credit for million 
the interest rate is set at the bank s discretion at a rate less than or equal to the bank s prime rate 
at december   the rate was 
as of december   the unused and available portion of this credit line was million 
although there are no assurances  management believes it can obtain an additional line of credit  if necessary 
outlook  risks and uncertainties this outlook  risks and uncertainties section contains statements regarding expectations  hopes  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future which are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve risks and uncertainties described below that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
the company assumes no liability to update any such forward looking statements 
in addition to those mentioned elsewhere in this section  such risks and uncertainties include the impact of competitive pressures in the marketplace  the degree and rate of market growth in the markets served by the company  changes in industry wide capacity  further consolidation of rail carriers  changes in governmental regulation  changes in the cost of services from vendors and fluctuations in interest rates 
revenue management estimates that in revenue growth will decline from current levels 
this estimate is based on management s opinion that the dramatic growth in the truckload brokerage and logistics businesses experienced in provides too large of a revenue base to sustain the same growth rate in furthermore  management cannot predict an acquisition similar to apldds in net revenue historically  the company contracted for all its drayage needs with of the attendant costs being classified as purchased transportation 
as the company sets up its own drayage operations  the salaries and benefits for non driver employees as well as general and administrative expenses are classified below the net revenue line as operating expenses 
assuming that the company fulfills its drayage needs at or below the previously contracted cost  the classification of a portion of the cost below net revenue will cause net revenue as a percentage of revenue related to the company s drayage operations to increase 
management expects fluctuations in the net revenue percentage from quarter to quarter caused by changes in business mix  changes in highway brokerage margins  changes in logistics business margins  changes in trailer and container capacity  changes in vendor pricing  changes in intermodal industry growth and changes in accounting estimates 
some of the company s rail vendors have increased rates in the first quarter of the company may not be able to pass some or all of these rate increases along to its customers 
salaries and benefits it is anticipated that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between revenue increases and changes in levels of staffing 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range are revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses or changes in customer requirements that result in a higher cost of labor per move 
depreciation and amortization management estimates that as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization will remain at current levels or increase in the future 
factors that could cause an increase in the percentage are increased leasehold improvement amortization as operating companies transition to larger facilities  increased software amortization on planned implementation of new packages in the truckload brokerage and logistics businesses and increased goodwill amortization that would arise if the company exercised any of its options to purchase the remaining minority interest in any of its operating partnerships 
other income expense interest expense in will increase significantly due to the issuance  on december   of a note for approximately in connection with the purchase of the remaining minority interest in hub north central 
interest expense related to tractor purchases will continue to increase as the company continues expansion into company owned drayage operations 
management estimates interest expense as it relates to the balloon notes assumed or issued in connection with the acquisition of hub partnerships will continue to decline on a quarterly basis as the various operating partnerships continue to make discretionary principal payments 
interest expense related to the notes issued in conjunction with the acquisition of apldds will decline from current levels in may of  and  coincident with the required principal payment terms 
management estimates that interest income will likely decrease from current levels 
factors that could cause such a decrease are the possible use of cash to i make payments on the balloon notes  ii make payments on the apldds notes  iii make payments on the note issued to acquire the remaining interest in hub north central  iv make down payments on tractors  v fund working capital needs for those operating companies starting their own company owned drayage operations  vi fund the purchase of the remaining minority interest in any of its operating partnerships and vii increase the company s capital investment in an international joint venture 
minority interest factors that could have a material impact and result in minority interest percentages of income before minority interest to be outside the historical range are i the exercise of any of the company s options to purchase the remaining minority interest in any of its operating companies and ii disproportionate changes in the profitability of businesses between those which are owned by the company and those which are owned less than by the company 
the purchase of the remaining minority interest in hub north central  assuming all other factors affecting minority interest are equal  should cause minority interest as a percentage of income before minority interest to decline 
net income management expects that net income growth rates after may will be significantly less than the pro forma net income growth rates experienced since may the company acquired apldds in may and management cannot predict a similar acquisition in earnings per share management expects that earnings per share growth rates after may will be significantly less than the pro forma net income growth rates experienced since may the company acquired apldds in may and management cannot predict a similar acquisition in liquidity and capital resources the company expects to continue to pay down  as a prepayment  the balloon notes from time to time as cash availability permits 
the company expects to meet all other liabilities as they become due 
management is considering additional sites for company owned tractors  and it is anticipated that company owned drayage operations  in total  will require the acquisition of approximately tractors in the company may purchase up to of these tractors with cash with the remainder being financed 
management estimates that each start up of a company owned drayage operation requires working capital of million to million above and beyond the cost of acquiring the tractors 
management estimates that an additional three to five locations may start company owned drayage operations by the end of management intends to carefully evaluate existing and new drayage operations before committing additional capital resources 
the company has the continuing option  exercisable any time after the president currently associated with an operating partnership ceases to be an employee  to purchase the remaining interest in that partnership 
the future exercise of such options could result in the need for significant funds 
those funds may come from existing cash  third party debt  other financing or any combination thereof 
the company believes that existing cash  cash provided by operations and cash available under a line of credit and its other financing commitment will be sufficient to meet the company s short term working capital and capital expenditure needs 
the company is currently negotiating a million line of credit 
although no assurances can be made  it is anticipated that this line of credit will become effective in the company believes that the aforementioned items are sufficient to meet its anticipated long term working capital  capital expenditure and debt repayment needs through at least the year
