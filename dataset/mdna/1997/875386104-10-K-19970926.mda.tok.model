tandy leather company the decrease in net sales at tandy leather is primarily attributable to same store sales decreases of from fiscal  as well as  the closing of seven stores during fiscal the same store sales decline is attributable to a lack of successful new product introductions  high store manager turnover  low in stock position in top selling items and a decrease in store traffic which was partially offset by a higher average ticket 
in response to these issues  steps were taken during the fourth quarter to strengthen tandy leather s management team with a renewed focus on new product development  improved marketing and advertising to core customer segments and more efficient and effective merchandising  logistics and store replenishment processes 
operating income for tandy leather decreased compared to the prior year due to the decrease in sales and a slight decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales 
the decrease in gross profit percentage is a result of a change in sales mix 
as a result of the decrease in sales of higher margin fashion merchandise  leather products have comprised a greater portion of the chain s total sales  bringing the overall gross margin percentage down slightly 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  however  these expenses increased as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year due to a greater decrease in sales relative to the decrease in support and administrative expenses 
labor expense increased as a result of efforts to improve retention of store managers 
sav on office supplies sav on office supplies achieved a increase in net sales over fiscal due to same store sales increases of  partially offset by two stores which were closed during the current year 
the fiscal sales increase was achieved despite big box office supply competitors entering nine of sav on s markets during the last year 
the same store sales increases are primarily attributable to the addition of a line of pc printers and fax machines to the merchandise assortment and a slight increase in furniture sales 
management expects same store sales percentage increases to decline somewhat in fiscal due to the fact that the line of printer and fax machines has been in the stores for a full year and  accordingly  will not have the same percentage increase impact 
management plans to expand the chain by opening four to six new stores in strategic markets during fiscal actual results may differ from these forward looking projections

after a weak first quarter  joshua s rebounded strongly with net sales increases of over for the last three quarters of fiscal management believes that the repositioning charge taken in the third quarter fiscal has enabled the chain to move quickly through its discontinued merchandise and has further improved the merchandise assortment in the stores 
it has also allowed management to redirect their primary focus to best selling  higher turning inventory and higher volume stores 
the operating loss experienced by joshua s in fiscal includes repositioning charges of  to write down and liquidate discontinued inventory and to close thirteen stores 
the current year loss  excluding the  charge  was  however  gross margin dollars increased  or  with gross margin as a percent of sales increasing slightly 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the repositioning charges  increased  or  primarily due to increases in store labor and advertising expenses 
a comprehensive review of expenses was performed late in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of that review  a number of actions were taken to reduce store labor and other expenses
