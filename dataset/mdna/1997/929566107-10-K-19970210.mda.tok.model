due to oversupply of new trailers in and industry consolidation in the full truckload segment  new trailer shipments in decreased an estimated from  compared to a increase in from and a increase in from during these periods the company was able to increase its net sales in and  however  sales decreased in during  however  the company was able to increase its estimated market share despite the reduction in total industry new trailer shipments as a result of its strategy to continuously improve productivity  increase capacity and to provide superior equipment to the full truckload  refrigerated and intermodal segments  as follows years ended december  dollar amounts in thousands net sales    decrease increase in sales from prior period estimated share of new trailer market the decreased net sales for was attributable to a decrease in new trailer sales of million  offset by increased aftermarket parts sales of million  increased sales of used trailers previously under lease by the finance company of million and a million increase in the revenues of the finance company 
the decrease in new trailer sales for the year was attributable to a decrease in units sold  reflecting the decreased production on the company s plate trailer line as a result of the limited supply of composite material and the decline in us truck trailer demand 
in late  the company introduced its new composite plate trailer  the duraplate r trailer  the next generation of the plate trailer 
historically  the aluminum plate trailer had accounted for over half of the company s revenues and even a greater percentage of its earnings 
while not proprietary  the company has enjoyed a sizable market share within this segment 
as the success of the aluminum plate trailer grew  the company experienced increased competition within its main product line and as a result  decreased margins 
with this in mind  the company has been developing for some time the next generation of the aluminum plate trailer  one which is proprietary in design 
with the introduction of the duraplate trailer many of the company s customers delayed taking the aluminum plate trailer 
at the same time  the company was severely limited on the supply of the composite material from one supplier who was not able to increase its capacity 
as a result  the company s plate trailer production decreased approximately from the company anticipates supply of the composite material to improve over the next several quarters as its supplier increases manufacturing capacity  however  this increased capacity is not expected to fulfill the company s long term demand for this product 
as a result  the company plans to construct its own composite manufacturing facility in lafayette  indiana during at an estimated cost of million to million 
furthermore  the company expects pricing to improve in the standard trailer market as overall manufacturing capacity decreases in the domestic trailer market during this period of consolidation 
the million increase in leasing and finance revenues during was due to the increase in the number of trailers leased and financed to customers  which increased from approximately  trailers on lease at december  to approximately  trailers on lease at december  and due to the increase in the sale of leased or financed equipment 
the increase in aftermarket parts sales reflects the company s strategy of continuing to increase its independent dealer network  which consisted of over independent dealers at december  the increase in sales of and in and  respectively  reflects an increase in units sold due to increased demand for the company s products 
gross profit during  the company experienced continued growth in the demand for several new products recently introduced  including  among others  its new composite plate trailer 
however  due to a limited supply of composite material available from the company s supplier  production on the company s plate trailer line was down from levels 
as a result  the company s production mix in was concentrated in the standard type trailer market which experienced significant pricing pressures and resulted in the company s decreased gross profit margins 
in addition  during late the company completed its capacity expansion program which tripled its production capacity over levels and achieved a record number of new product introductions and new product developments 
this increased level of capital expenditures impacted the company s gross margin percentage in due to the unfavorable production mix in the company believes these investments have positioned it for continued growth in the foreseeable future in light of a downturn in the domestic trailer market while at the same time giving it the opportunity to improve gross margins
