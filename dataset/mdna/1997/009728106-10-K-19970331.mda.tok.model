item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
results of operations comparison of six months ended december  and effective july   the company changed its fiscal year end from june to december the table below includes the summary income statement for the six month periods ended december  and which should be considered for the discussions which follow 
six months ended december in thousands  except per share amounts net sales ophthalmic distribution   injectable distribution   contract manufacturing   cost of goods sold   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expenses   research and development operating income  interest and other income expense net income before income taxes  income taxes net income net income per share 
net sales the company s consolidated net sales declined to million for the six months ended december  as compared to the same period in ophthalmic distribution sales declined from the comparable period in this decline is primarily related to the effect of the company s decision to discontinue its practice of giving discounts to wholesalers at the end of every quarter effective with the quarter ended june  the effect of this decision was mainly realized in the quarter ended september   as sales for this division for the quarter ended december  were million  or flat with sales for the quarter ended december  while this decision has resulted in lower sales volumes  it is expected to have a positive impact on margins in the future and it has allowed for the better management and projection of sales for the division 
the generic pharmaceutical market continues to experience price erosion which has impacted sales and margins 
however  the patent of the most significant therapeutic ophthalmic pharmaceutical product timolol maleate will expire in late march as previously announced  the company has received pre approval from the fda to manufacture and sell this product as a generic pharmaceutical and is aggressively pursuing negotiations with wholesalers and chain pharmacies for the stocking of this product once patent expiration occurs 
the company s core business of sales to practitioners remains solid and margins are relatively stable 
efforts of the ophthalmic division sales and marketing group  now headed by the recently hired general manager r 
scott zion  will continue to be focused in this area 
for the six months ended december   injectable distribution sales nearly doubled as compared to the same period in this increase includes the effects of the acquisition of an injectable product line from janssen pharmaceutica  inc janssen on july  prior to the acquisition  sales of this product line were reported as contract manufacturing sales 
sales of the janssen product line for the six month period ended december  were million 
in addition  the injectable distribution segment has experienced growth on several of its high margin niche products 
since the merger of taylor with pasadena research laboratories  inc prl in may  the company has redirected a significant amount of its r d efforts towards the development of generic injectable products that will enhance the current product portfolio offering of the injectable distribution segment 
several category b products are expected to be available for sale in early  pending the outcome of the company s r d efforts 
for the six months ended december   contract manufacturing sales declined from the comparable period in this decline is primarily attributable to the transfer of sales of the janssen product line to the injectable distribution segment as noted above 
since the merger with prl  and the addition of new management  the company has increased its marketing efforts in the area of contract manufacturing 
this marketing effort focuses on taylor s ability to provide a full range of services  including product development  regulatory and sterile manufacturing 
these efforts are expected to help establish more long term relationships with contract customers 
gross profit consolidated gross profit declined to million in the six months ended december  compared to million for the same period of the previous year  with gross profit margin declining approximately three percentage points to 
gross profit margin for the ophthalmic distribution segment improved slightly by one percentage point 
while gross profit margin improved in the injectable distribution segment  reduced volume in the contract manufacturing segment resulted in an overall decline in consolidated gross profit margin due to underabsorption of overhead 
in august  the company took steps to reduce a significant portion of its fixed and variable costs in the manufacturing operations 
however  low plant volume related to weakness in the contract manufacturing segment and lower ophthalmic production due to high inventory levels caused by the change in wholesaler discounting policies  had a negative impact on manufacturing margins 
in the quarter ended december   the company increased its reserve for estimated unsaleable inventory by approximately  this change in estimate is reported as a decrease in gross profit 
excluding this change in estimate  the gross margin of the six months ended december  and was and  respectively 
the company anticipates that gross margins will continue to be impacted by price erosion on generic pharmaceuticals 
however  with anticipated growth in certain higher margin niche products  the company s overall gross margins should remain relatively stable during as the injectable segment begins the marketing of more commodity generic products  overall company margins are expected to decline beyond selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased during the six months ended december  as compared to the same period in this slight increase is primarily associated with changes in the timing of certain large promotional expenses for the ophthalmic division and enhanced sales and marketing efforts in the contract manufacturing and injectable distribution segments 
in the quarter ended december   the company reduced its reserve for products being transferred from the company s previous manufacturing facilities site transfers by  primarily due to the decision not to pursue an exclusive raw material source on one of these products 
the percentage of s  g a expenses to sales increased to for the six months ended december  from in the comparable prior year period 
research and development research and development r d expense for the six months ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the same period in this increase reflects a change in the mix of products under development due to a reduced emphasis on site transfers 
the estimated cost of these site transfers has been previously accrued and therefore does not have an effect on r d expense as reported in the statements of income 
in addition  through most of the six months ended december   the company continued the aggressive r d efforts that had been ongoing at prl through contractual arrangements as noted previously  the company has redirected a significant portion of its r d efforts to injectable products in response to the prl merger 
these efforts include development of new products and the in house manufacture of products distributed by the injectable distribution segment 
the company also continues the development of a non steroidal  anti inflammatory drug nsaid for ophthalmic use which was licensed from pfizer inc pfizer 
phase iii studies for the nsaid are expected to begin in early as of december   approximately  of funds received from pfizer remain available for the financing of this project 
based on the above  it is anticipated that r d expense will increase in however  the company will continue to monitor such expenses in light of operating performance 
interest and other income expense interest and other expense  net increased  for the six months ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase is primarily related to the increase in interest expense associated with a greater average outstanding loan balance on the company s term debt 
the primary increase in the term debt resulted from the borrowing of million in july in connection with the acquisition of the janssen product line which included certain production equipment for the products 
the company anticipates that interest expense will increase significantly in as a result of the new long term debt associated with the janssen product acquisition and anticipated capital improvements 
a portion of this interest is expected to be capitalized during during validation and construction periods 
income taxes the effective tax rate for the six months ended december  and was and  respectively 
the company has reached a preliminary settlement with the internal revenue service irs regarding proposed adjustments made during the examination of tax returns for the periods of through which the company appealed 
these proposed adjustments primarily related to the timing of deductions taken for tax purposes in connection with the reorganization of the company s manufacturing operations in the settlement which has been obtained through the appeals process must be approved by the joint committee on taxation 
adjustments to reflect the proposed settlement  primarily related to interest of approximately  to  have been made in previous financial statements 
net income net income for the six months ended december  was approximately break even compared to the prior year income of  or five cents per share  primarily due to the low overhead absorption in the company s manufacturing facility and the increase in r d expenditures noted above 
comparison of the twelve months ended june   and in the following discussions  references to financial results during a given year relate to the twelve month period ending june of that year  unless otherwise indicated 
net sales the company s consolidated net sales declined to million in compared to the prior year 
this follows a increase in the prior year as compared with the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by segment  excluding intersegment sales years ended june in millions ophthalmic distribution injectable distribution contract manufacturing total net sales ophthalmic distribution sales include a broad range of therapeutic  diagnostic  surgical and office based products 
ophthalmic distribution sales declined in as compared to and increased in as compared to the decline in sales for is attributable primarily to two factors 
these include the loss of sales for ak con a  the company s previously best selling allergy product  and the discontinuance of certain discounting practices with wholesalers in the fourth quarter of discussed above 
as previously announced  ak con a was converted to over the counter status by the fda  which required the filing of a nda 
sales of ak con a were discontinued in october  pending fda approval of the nda 
the company received approval of the otc version of the product in january the otc version is being marketed through a joint venture with pfizer 
royalties earned under this joint venture totaled  in fiscal sales of ak con a were approximately million and million  respectively  in and as discussed above  in the fourth quarter of  the company discontinued the practice employed by the ophthalmic division of giving discounts to wholesalers at the end of every quarter 
the company was willing to forego the additional sales in the quarter in an effort to maintain margins at an acceptable rate in the future 
because of the discontinuance of this practice  the company estimates that sales for the quarter and fiscal year ended june  were negatively impacted by approximately million 
excluding the effects of the loss of ak con a and the discontinuance of the wholesaler discounting practice  sales for the ophthalmic segment were relatively flat 
continued erosion of generic pricing along with some product shortages have offset sales increases in other products during the company continues to experience increases in its sales of surgical products which includes surgical instruments and surgical packs 
the surgical products area will continue to be a major focus for the ophthalmic segment since margins are generally higher than for generic pharmaceuticals and sales are controlled more directly by physicians  a customer base which has been traditionally a strength for akorn 
in  ophthalmic distribution sales were enhanced by sales of ak con a  the introduction of several new surgical products  including new surgical instruments and surgical packs  and sales of the company s generic therapeutic products 
injectable distribution sales attributable to prl  which was acquired by the company on may  in a pooling of interests transaction declined in as compared to and increased in as compared to the current year decline is primarily attributable to delays in new product introductions and additional competition on a few of the company s injectable products 
the sales increase in is primarily attributable to an expanded offering of certain grandfathered products  including this segment s lead product for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
in addition  in  the company established several marketing alliances which gave it an entree into the group purchasing organization gpo market for injectables 
contract manufacturing sales were relatively flat in versus and increased in as compared to contract sales for were enhanced by a new contract from janssen  which increased sales significantly beginning in the second half of fiscal sales to janssen accounted for and of consolidated net sales in and  respectively 
janssen had recently notified the company that it would be transferring the production of certain products during fiscal and to its own facilities in puerto rico 
such products accounted for million and million in contract manufacturing sales for and  respectively 
as noted above  effective july   janssen agreed to transfer to the company ownership of three injectable products in the analgesia anesthesia area  two of which previously had been produced for janssen by taylor  but which janssen had determined to discontinue 
these products accounted for approximately million and million in sales for taylor in and  respectively 
the acquisition of these products will help maintain plant volume from these products and has provided the injectable distribution segment with two highly recognized products 
income and expenses the following table sets forth the relationship to sales of various income statement items years ended june net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development acquisition and severance costs operating income interest and other income expense  net 


income before income taxes income taxes 

net income gross profit the consolidated gross margin percentage declined by percentage points from in to in the decline in gross profit margin is primarily due to continued price pressure in the ophthalmic generic pharmaceuticals area due to competition  as well as the loss of the company s high margin sales of ak con a 
in addition  lower plant throughput  primarily in the second half of fiscal  resulted in margin declines for the contract manufacturing segment 
also  in the second half of fiscal  the company increased its estimate for unsaleable inventory by approximately  in the quarter ended june   the company increased its estimate for wholesaler chargebacks by approximately  these changes in estimate are reported as a decrease in gross margin 
excluding these changes  the gross margin for was  a percentage point decline from the gross margin percentage declined percentage points from in to in the decline in gross margin percentage in is primarily due to the effects of price increases from manufacturers primarily in the second half of the fiscal year  which were not fully offset by price increases to customers 
in addition  a shift in the mix of lower margin catalog products added to the decline in gross margin 
the decline in gross margin was more prevalent in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the loss of sales from ak con a discussed earlier 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales declined percentage points from in to in in the quarter ended march   the company decided to no longer pursue andas for several ophthalmic site transfer products 
this decision was based on the cost of the andas versus the future incremental profit to be derived from the sales of these products  given changed market conditions 
this change in estimate was also based on the company s recent decision to enter into the injectable distribution marketplace and the need to redeploy r d resources for the pursuit of injectable andas 
the total amount of the accrual reversed was approximately  and is included as a reduction in s  g a expenses 
during the quarter ended march   the company  based on evaluations made by management  changed the estimated liability related to aged customer credits 
this resulted in a reduction in s  g a expenses of approximately  the decline in s  g a expenses as a percentage of net sales  in spite of the decrease in sales from to  is primarily due to the decision to eliminate approximately million to million of s  g a expenses and other manufacturing operating expenses in response to a slowing in sales growth during the third quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales declined percentage points from in to in primarily due to the company s operating leverage and the increase in net sales from to research and development r d expense increased in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in r d associated with the recently acquired operations of prl 
prior to fiscal  prl had very little r d expense 
research and development expense was relatively flat in as compared to in  the company maintained a stable mix of new ophthalmic andas and site transfers from its previous manufacturing facility in los angeles 
throughout and the first half of  the company incurred r d costs associated with its nda for the over the counter version of ak con a in connection with the licensing arrangement with pfizer 
this nda was approved in january costs associated with this nda have been capitalized in connection with the long term contract for manufacturing and royalty rights 
the company also continued its work on an nda for the ophthalmic nsaid piroxicam licensed from pfizer 
the first million of costs associated with this nda are offset by funds obtained from pfizer 
total cash expenditures for all research and development activities were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as noted above  with the acquisition of prl  the company expects to increase its mix of injectable category b and anda products 
prl had several anda filings in process through joint venture arrangements 
some of these arrangements have continued subsequent to the acquisition and some of the projects have been brought in house 
the company has also continued to develop other injectable products for manufacture by taylor 
several of the products currently marketed and distributed by the injectable distribution segment do not require fda approval and production of such products will be transferred to the taylor facilities as soon as practicable acquisition and severance costs in connection with the merger of prl and taylor  the company recorded certain charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal for transaction costs  and transitional costs  associated with the realignment of the company into two separate reporting divisions 
the transaction costs include legal  accounting and other directly related acquisition costs 
transitional costs consist primarily of provisions for severance related costs 
operating income operating income in of million or of sales was lower than operating income of million 
the decline in operating income for is attributable to several factors noted above 
these include acquisition and severance costs  the loss of high margin sales of ak con a  the company s decision to discontinue wholesaler discounting practices in the fourth quarter  and the changes in estimate noted above 
in addition  the overall reduction in gross margins for the company  primarily associated with increased price sensitivity for ophthalmic generic pharmaceuticals  reduced operating margins 
operating income in was million or of sales compared to the amount of million or of sales 
the increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales and operating leverage  coupled with stable research and development expenses 
the sales increase was somewhat offset by the decline in gross margin resulting from cost increases of products distributed but not manufactured and continued price sensitivity in the generic ophthalmic pharmaceutical market 
interest and other income expense net interest and other expense declined  from to during these periods  interest income remained relatively constant 
interest expense increased significantly in to  as compared to  in most interest expense in was capitalized in connection with construction at taylor s facilities in decatur  illinois 
the increase in interest expense in was offset by a gain on the sale of marketable equity securities of  in  a  decline in market value of an equity investment was determined to be other than temporary 
this determination was based on the significant deterioration in the value of the investment and the evaluation that a price recovery was not imminent 
from to  net interest and other expense increased  during these periods  interest income remained relatively constant 
interest expense declined in from  to  as noted above  the majority of interest expense in was capitalized 
the loss of  related to the decline in market value of an equity investment more than offset the decline in interest expense 
income taxes the company s consolidated effective income tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the effective rate for varies from the statutory rates primarily due to the inclusion of net income for prl prior to the acquisition date as a result of the pooling of interests 
prl was a subchapter s corporation and therefore was not subject to corporate income taxes 
the effects of pre acquisition earnings or loss of prl did not have a material effect on the or effective rate since such income or loss was immaterial to consolidated pretax income 
the effective rate for varies from the statutory rates primarily due to the effects of adoption of statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  effective july  under sfas  the company was able to recognize estimated future tax benefits attributable to expenses recorded for book purposes but not currently deductible for tax purposes 
in july  the company recorded a net deferred tax asset in the amount of  along with a valuation reserve to reflect the uncertainties surrounding the ultimate realization of the benefits 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to reverse the entire remaining balance of the valuation reserve since uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of the benefits were reduced to a relatively low level 
this resulted in the recording of a  
cents per share benefit in the fourth quarter 
net income net income declined million or 
cents per share in from million or 
cents per share in the decline in sales along with certain unusual  infrequently occurring adjustments noted previously  including acquisition and severance costs  and certain other changes in accounting estimates  are the primary reasons for the decline in net income 
net income increased  or 
cent per share from million or 
cents per share in to million or 
cents per share in this marginal increase  in spite of the significant increase in operating income in  is due to the lower effective tax rate incurred in as a result of the adoption of sfas and full realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets 
financial condition and liquidity management assesses the company s liquidity by its ability to generate cash to fund its operations 
the significant components in managing liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of working capital items including accounts receivable  inventories  wholesaler chargeback accruals and accounts payable  capital expenditure and debt repayment requirements  adequacy of available lines of credit  and availability of long term capital at competitive prices 
in december  the company successfully obtained the restructuring of its existing debt facilities 
the restructuring  which was completed in march  included the following an increase in the current working capital line of credit from million to million a consolidation of all term debt into one note  with an increase in available term funding from million to million  resulting in maximum term financing of million reduction in the interest rate on all the facilities to prime rate postponement of principal repayments on the term facility until january restructuring of loan covenants based on current financial condition and cash flow of the company with this restructuring in place  the company is confident that it can meet its capital requirements for the company traditionally has generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements 
the net cash provided by operating activities was million for the six months ended december  for the twelve months ended june   and  net cash provided by operating activities was   and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended december  is primarily related to the increase in accruals for wholesaler chargebacks see note a to the financial statements 
this increase in the chargeback accrual is primarily related to the janssen product line which has a significant price difference between the wholesale price and the majority of contract prices for the products 
this accrual has stabilized as of december  the decline in cash provided from operating activities in and is primarily related to the increase in inventory associated with new product additions and a continual increase in the amount of products produced in house which require akorn to inventory related raw materials and components 
also in  the majority of new contract manufacturing business requires that the company inventory raw materials and components 
in  cash provided from operations was also negatively impacted by a decrease in the average days outstanding for payables 
this decline was due to more timely payments to vendors by the company resulting from the availability of working capital credit lines 
the company recently announced that it would be moving its corporate offices and the majority of its ophthalmic distribution offices to lincolnshire  illinois 
the costs of this relocation  for which a charge will be made in the quarter ended march   are estimated to be in the range of  to  after taxes 
these costs include severance  asset write downs and relocation costs  the cash portion of which are expected to be financed by current cash  available lines of credit  and operating cash flows 
in  the company will also continue to fund the development of the nda for piroxicam discussed previously which will be funded primarily from funds received from pfizer 
in addition to these short term needs  the company will be required to make payments of additional interest and taxes  currently estimated to be approximately  to  in connection with the anticipated settlement of the irs appeal discussed above 
the timing of the payment of this settlement will be based on the length of the joint committee approval process 
also  in connection with the janssen product line acquisition  the company is required to provide certain products to janssen in  at no cost  estimated not to exceed  should certain contingent events occur 
net cash utilized for investing activities during the six month period ended december  of approximately million  includes million of property  plant and equipment additions  primarily for equipment acquired for the janssen products  and  for the allocated portion of the product line itself 
these additions were partially offset by net sales of investments of  the remainder of these investing activities were funded through million of bank financing 
the company has plans for capital improvements of million to million in these improvements are for both requirements to meet current fda and dea regulations as well as upgrades to the company s management information systems 
these improvements will be financed through available term debt financing through the company s prime banking institution 
the company used net cash of  in its financing activities during the six months ended december   as principal repayments on capital leases  and both long term and short term debt slightly exceeded the million of borrowings for the janssen product line acquisition
