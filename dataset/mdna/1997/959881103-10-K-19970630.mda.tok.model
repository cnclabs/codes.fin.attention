the amount of increases  however  are limited to the decreases in other assets 
in this regard  effective october  the company recognized a  write down in the value of its non operational silica sorting and grinding plant the silica plant 
this write down was offset by a corresponding write up of a like amount which was allocated proportionately  based on the relative excess of fair market value of each asset over historic book basis  to real estate held for resale  water rights held for sale  and water sale fees

as a result  upon the purchase of assets that contain both real estate and water rights  the basis of such assets is allocated to real estate and water rights based on the relative fair market values of the components at the time of acquisition  and development costs are allocated to the appropriate component whenever possible 
due to the limited number of comparable water sales in the cherry creek basin  the company has relied on periodic evaluations prepared by independent water engineers to determine the relative fair values of the water rights acquired by the company through its purchases of real estate for the cherry creek project 
accordingly  as properties or water rights are sold  the allocated portion of the basis is included in cost of revenue 
during the fiscal year ended march   the valuation allowance was increased as a result of the current year s net operating loss carryforward

during fiscal  the company sold or discounted secured promissory notes with a principal amount of  since the promissory notes were sold at a discount  the company recognized a loss of  interest expense in fiscal increased significantly due to interest expenses related to the  debentures that were issued in september interest of   and  on debt incurred in connection with properties being developed was capitalized during fiscal   and  respectively 
rental income and expenses are primarily related to the company s california rice farm and ranch 
the company also receives miscellaneous rents on certain of the cherry creek  colorado properties 
the company accounted for its investment in the nevada llc under the equity method of accounting and accordingly income or losses were allocated according to the company s ownership interest in the nevada llc 
for fiscal and fiscal the company recorded a loss of  and  respectively 
the company sold its interest in the nevada llc after the end of fiscal discontinued operation year ended march  loss from discontinued operation    the company is accounting for the inactive silica plant as a discontinued operation 
prior to the quasi reorganization  the company had attempted to sell the silica plant as an entire operating unit and accordingly the annual impairment assessment of the plant had been based on the estimated net realizable value of the plant in place 
in that regard  the company considered an outstanding letter of intent for the sale of the plant and an independent appraisal of the value of the silica plant to determine that the value of the plant had not been further impaired from its carrying value as determined at the time it was shutdown in in october  in connection with the quasi reorganization  the company committed to a formal plan to liquidate the silica plant rather than continuing to attempt to sell it as an entire operating unit 
accordingly  the plant was revalued in terms of the present conditions  that is on a piecemeal  liquidation basis 
the company has engaged an equipment liquidator to sell the silica plant 
as of march   the company had disposed of approximately of the silica plant s equipment on which it recognized a loss of  charges in fiscal  and were for costs in excess of the reserve for estimated loss on disposal and discontinued operations which was previously recorded 
liquidity and capital resources in february  the company issued  of a new series of its convertible non participating preferred stock from which it received net proceeds of approximately  at march   the company had working capital of  and had a current ratio of 
the company s liquidity increased after the end of fiscal due to the sale in april of the company s interest in the nevada llc for a price of  of which  was paid in cash 
in addition  the company s liquidity was further improved after the close of fiscal due to the sale of an additional  of series c preferred stock 
operating activities 
during fiscal  the company had negative cash flow from operations of  in addition to operating expenses  the company used cash reserves of  for payments on accounts payable   for other current assets and  for accrued interest 
the cash outflow was partially offset by a net decrease in land held for sale of  and an increase in accrued expenses of  other operating activities provided cash of approximately  in fiscal  the company continued to receive revenue from the sale of portions of its real property located in the cherry creek basin 
the company intends to continue such sales by marketing the additional  acres it is developing in cherry creek 
the company expects that its operating revenues will continue to be highly volatile 
future revenue from disposition of real estate will be dependent on the company s ability to dispose of real estate parcels on acceptable terms  as to which there can be no assurance 
revenue from sale of water or water rights will likewise be dependent on individually negotiated transactions 
revenues from leasing the company s rice farms and ranches  from the cucamonga water fee agreement  and from principal and interest payments received on promissory notes held by the company will be more predictable  but will be insufficient by themselves to cover the company s general and administrative expenses and the company s interest obligations under the debentures 
accordingly  until the company can increase its revenue from water sales of its own water rights  or acting as an agent for others  the company s cash flow will be principally derived from the sale of its remaining real estate 
investing and financing activities 
in february  the company received approximately  of net proceeds from the private placement of  shares of a new series of its convertible preferred stock at a price of  per share 
the shares of preferred stock are part of the  shares of currently outstanding shares of series c preferred stock

the company will be required to make semiannual interest payments of  on the  principal amount of debentures  beginning march  the holders of series c preferred stock are entitled to receive annual dividends in the amount of per share  payable semi annually on january and july of each year semi annually 
the first four semi annual dividend payments july  through and including january  to be made with respect to series c preferred stock may be made  in the sole discretion of the board of directors  in cash or  in full or in part  by issuing additional shares of series c preferred stock 
thereafter all dividend payments made with respect to the series c preferred stock are required to be paid in cash 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund the company s foreseeable working capital needs in excess of revenue for a period of at least one year from the date of this report 
the company plans to meet its commitments thereafter from revenues derived from the sale of water or water rights  from refinancing or selling its remaining real estate assets  and  if necessary  from future debt or equity financings 
certain events that occurred subsequent to the end of fiscal will impact the company s ability to meet its working capital requirements during the next twelve months in april the company sold its interest in nevada llc for  of which  was paid in cash and  was paid by the delivery to the company of a convertible note due on december  in april the company sold  of its series c preferred stock 
as a result of the private placement  the company received net proceeds of approximately  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
impact of accounting pronouncement issued but not adopted by the company in february  the financial accountant standards board issued statement of financial accountant standards no 
 earnings per share sfas no 

sfas no 
simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share and makes them comparable to international earnings per share standards 
it replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share 
it also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the income statement for all entities with a complex capital structure and requires certain reconciliation to be disclosed 
the adoption of sfas no 
will be reflected on the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended march  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of sfas no 
risk factors the company s business and operations involve numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control  that may affect future results and the market price of the company s common stock 
the following discussion highlights some of the risks the company faces 
uneven patterns of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
these quarterly fluctuations are the result of a number of factors  including the company s dependence on isolated sales of real estate as its principal source of revenues and the sporadic revenues generated to date from the company s water related activities 
until the company enters into agreements for the long term sale lease of water  the company s revenues will continue to be dependent upon periodic and isolated sales of water and or real estate 
because of the variations in the company s quarterly results  the price of the company s common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly 
limited history of operations in principal business 
to date  the company s activities have primarily consisted of i acquiring its various water rights and related assets  ii raising capital to fund both the cost of such acquisitions and its working capital needs  and iii developing its water rights 
although the company operates in two business segments water rights activities and its real estate development and disposition activities  the company anticipates that a majority of its revenues in the future will be derived from its water rights activities 
however  the company only generated   and  of revenue from its water rights activities during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
accordingly  the company does not have an established record of water rights transactions 
to date  the company s administrative and interest expenses have exceeded its on going revenue from its water and water rights development and disposition business  and the majority of its operating revenue have been derived from the sale of the company s real estate assets 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be able to profitably resell its remaining real estate holdings in the future or that it will be able to successfully develop  package and sell water rights 
uncertainty of future real estate revenue 
during the past three fiscal years  revenue from the disposition of real estate have constituted approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
accordingly  until the company completes its water development activities and derives revenue from the sale or other disposition of its water resources  the company s ability to generate revenue will continue to be dependent primarily on its ability to sell its real estate holdings 
to date  the company s real estate sales efforts in colorado have benefitted from a strong demand for real estate in the cherry creek basin 
no assurance can  however  be given that the current market conditions in the cherry creek market will continue or that the company will be able to profitably resell its real estate assets in the future 
the company s ability to sell its colorado and california real estate properties will also be dependent on general economic conditions  on interest rates  and on the location and particular characteristics of the properties offered for sale 
uncertainty of future water revenue 
the company s business plan is twofold to engage in various water acquisition  transfer  development and sale activities  and to develop and dispose of the real estate that it acquires in connection with the acquisition of water rights 
while the company s current operating revenue has been primarily derived from real estate sales  the company s long term future profitability will be primarily dependent on i the company s ability to sell significant quantities of water from the company s northern california water assets  ii the company s ability to develop and sell water or water rights packages as part of the cherry creek project  and iii the company s activities as an independent water provider in southern california 
until may  the company s plan was to permit the yuba county water agency to integrate the company s yuba property water into the water agency s conjunctive use plans for developing and marketing water to third parties 
the company s agreement with the yuba county water agency regarding the joint development and marketing of water expired in may  and the company is currently evaluating various alternative plans to commercially exploit its yuba property water rights 
the value of the company s cherry creek project is dependent upon the approval of the company s proposed plan of augmentation 
the colorado water court has rejected the company s initial cherry creek plan of augmentation based on objections that were filed with the court by the third parties 
although the company has since received the consent of all but one of the objectors  no assurance can be given that the colorado water court will approve the company s plan of augmentation in the near future  or ever 
the company s ability to become an independent water provider in southern california is dependent upon the company acquiring groundwater rights and other water assets  its ability to arrange for the transportation and storage of water  its success in obtaining all necessary consents and approvals  and on its ability to finance the foregoing activities 
to date  the company has not yet consummated any water transfer transactions in southern california  and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to do so in the future
