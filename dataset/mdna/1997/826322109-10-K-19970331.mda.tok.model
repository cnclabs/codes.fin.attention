the proceeds of the pca loan were used by pca to make a principal payment under pca s existing credit facility in which citibank na is the agent pca credit facility 
the pca loan is subordinated as to payment of principal and interest to the amount due under the pca credit facility estimated to be in excess of million and is secured by a lien on the stock of certain of pca s subsidiaries  second in priority to the lien securing the pca credit facility 
the pca loan provides that the company will not take any action to collect payment until the earlier of the pca credit facility being paid in full or six months from the date the company notifies citibank na  as agent  that it intends to take such action

the company has submitted a proposal as the prime contractor to ochampus to provide managed health care coverage to champus eligible beneficiaries in region this region includes approximately  individuals in connecticut  delaware  maine  maryland  massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  rhode island  vermont  northern virginia and washington  dc the company expects to incur expenses of approximately to million during the region contract proposal process 
the company submitted its final bid on february  and anticipates learning of the result of its bid in the second quarter of the contract  if awarded to the company  will result in approximately billion in estimated revenues over the term of the contract 
inflation health care costs generally continue to rise at a faster rate than the consumer price index 
the company has been able to lessen somewhat the impact of inflation by managing medical costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that  in the future  the company s ability to manage medical costs will not be negatively impacted by items such as technological advances  utilization changes and catastrophic items  which could  in turn  result in medical cost increases equaling or exceeding premium increases 
health care reform as a result of the continued escalation of health care costs and the inability of many individuals to obtain health care insurance  numerous proposals relating to health care reform have been or may be introduced in the united states congress and state legislatures 
any proposals affecting underwriting practices  limiting rate increases  requiring new or additional benefits or affecting contracting arrangements including proposals to require hmos and ppos to accept any health care providers willing to abide by an hmo s or ppo s contract terms may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
for example  recent news reports indicate that president clinton may submit a budget proposal to congress that will reduce medicare spending by billion and impose certain limits on medicaid spending 
although neither the present administration s health care reform proposals nor alternative health care reform proposals introduced by certain members of congress were previously adopted  the health insurance portability and accountability act of the accountability act was passed by congress and signed into law by president clinton on august  and will generally take effect beginning july  while the accountability act contains provisions regarding health insurance or health plans  such as portability and limitations on pre existing condition exclusions  guaranteed availability and renewability  it also contains several anti fraud measures that significantly change health care fraud and abuse provisions 
some of the provisions include i creation of an anti fraud and abuse trust fund and coordination of fraud and abuse efforts by federal  state and local authorities  ii extension of the criminal anti kickback statues to all federal health programs  iii expansion of and increase in the amount of civil monetary penalties and establishment of a knowledge standard for individuals or entities potentially subject to civil monetary penalties  and iv revisions to current sanctions for fraud and abuse  including mandatory and permissive exclusion from participation in the medicare or medicaid programs 
the company does not believe that the accountability act should have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  but is unable to predict the ultimate impact of any federal or state restructuring of the health care financing and delivery system  which ultimately could have a material adverse impact on the operations  financial condition and prospects of the company
