cautionary statement for purposes of reform act the following contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act

the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
results of operations overview the company s current business activity focus is the exploration and development if warranted of precious metal and diamond deposits within specific geological domains 
under canadian gaap  expenditures relating to these activities are capitalized in recognition of the potential future value of prospective targets 
upon completion of the exploration phase  a decision to proceed to the development phase requires that these expenditures reflect the cost of the resultant reserves and be depleted on the unit of production basis over the estimated total reserve as mined 
a decision to discontinue exploration or not to proceed to the development stage for a specific project would result in reducing the capitalized total cost of the exploration program and charging those costs against income 
as such  reported net income or loss for the company may be volatile and principally represents investment revenues received through the investment of idle funds  the surplus received on redemption of preferred shares in ogml held by the company  and other revenues  as offset by those expenditures which cannot be directly attributed to a specific project and those costs for projects the company has elected to abandon 
under us gaap  exploration and general and administrative expenses related to projects are charged to expense as incurred  whereas under canadian gaap  such expenses are capitalized as discussed above 
property acquisition costs are deferred for both canadian and us gaap until it is determined whether a project is commercially feasible 
in addition  under us gaap  compensation expense is recorded for the excess of the quoted market price over the option price granted to employees and directors at the date of grant under stock option plans 
under canadian gaap  no compensation expense is recorded for such awards 
the gains on issuance of subsidiary s common stock recorded under canadian gaap in respect of the parc and guyanor equity financings would not be recorded under us gaap
