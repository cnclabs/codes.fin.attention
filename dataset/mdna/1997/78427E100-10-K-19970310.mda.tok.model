item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included in item of this report 
financial condition balance sheet changes total assets of billion at december  increased million or from billion at december  this growth in total assets occurred primarily in commercial and home equity loans and the investment portfolio and was funded by an increase in deposits and borrowings 
commercial loans totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december   an increase of million or 
this increase reflects the company s continued focus on lending activities in the local business market 
home equity loan balances grew from million as of december  to million as of december   an increase of million or 
this increase is the result of the company s consumer strategy and the active promotion of this product 
investments increased million to a total of million as of december  from the million reported one year earlier 
total deposits were million as of december  compared to million as of december   an increase of million or 
during this period  the company continued to focus on increasing its share of primary deposit relationships 
demand deposits and savings accounts increased million and million  respectively  as customers continued to take advantage of the company s consumer deposit strategy to attract and retain core deposits 
time deposit balances increased million or primarily due to the introduction of new cd products 
asset quality non performing assets non performing assets declined million from million at december  to million at december  non performing asset balances have declined significantly since december  as a result of the accelerated disposition program initiated by the company in  as well as an improvement in economic conditions 
the following table sets forth information regarding the components of non performing assets for the periods presented 
december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans residential real estate loans      commercial real estate loans      commercial loans    home equity loans consumer loans total non accrual loans 
     loans past due days still accruing   total non performing loans      foreclosed real estate     restructured loans on accrual status     total non performing assets      total non performing loans to total gross loans total non performing assets to total assets allowance for possible losses to non performing loans non accrual loans are loans that are contractually past due in excess of days  for which the company has stopped the accrual of interest  or loans which are not past due but on which the company has stopped the accrual of interest based on management s assessment of the circumstances surrounding these loans 
accruing loans past due days or more are loans which have not been placed on non accrual status as  in management s opinion  the collection of the loan and contractual interest  in full  is not in doubt 
foreclosed real estate includes oreo  defined as real estate acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
the company carries foreclosed real estate at net realizable value  which approximates fair value less estimated selling costs 
restructured loans are loans for which concessions  including reduction of interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments have been granted due to the borrower s financial condition 
restructured loans on non accrual status are reported in the non accrual loan category 
restructured loans on accrual status are those loans that have complied with terms of a restructuring agreement for a satisfactory period generally six months 
liquidity liquidity measures the ability of the company to meet its maturing obligations and existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund its operations and to provide for customer credit needs 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  advances from the fhlb of boston  repurchase agreements  repayments and maturities on loans and securities  proceeds from the sale of securities in the available for sale portfolio  and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and security amortization and maturities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and security prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions and the general level of interest rates and competition 
the company utilizes particular sources of funds based on comparative costs and availability 
the company generally manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a steady deposit balance  but has from time to time decided not to pay rates on deposits as high as its competition  and when necessary  will supplement deposits with longer term and or less expensive alternative sources of funds such as advances from the fhlb and repurchase agreements 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term responsibility of management 
the company adjusts its investments in cash and cash equivalents based upon management s assessment of expected loan demand  projected security maturities  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest bearing deposits  and the objectives of its asset liability management program 
if the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb and collateral eligible for repurchase agreements 
because the company has a stable retail deposit base  management believes that significant borrowings will not be necessary to maintain its current liquidity position 
the company s ongoing principal use of capital resources remains the origination of single family residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  and home equity loans secured by residential real estate as well as the purchase of investment securities 
management intends to continue seeking opportunities for expansion and believes that the company s liquidity  capital resources and borrowing capabilities are adequate for its current and intended operations 
capital resources regulatory capital the company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
as of december   the bank is considered well capitalized under the quantitative measures established by its regulators 
the company s current capital position and its regulatory requirements are discussed in greater detail in footnote regulatory capital in the notes to the financial statements 
interest rate risk management the operations of the company are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a substantial difference in the amount of the company s assets and liabilities that reprice or mature within specific time periods 
an asset sensitive position indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time horizons  which would generally imply a favorable impact on net interest income in periods of rising interest rates and an unfavorable impact in periods of falling interest rates 
a liability sensitive position would generally imply an unfavorable impact on net interest income in periods of rising interest rates and a favorable impact in periods of falling interest rates 
the objective of the company s interest rate risk management process is to identify  manage  and control its interest rate risk within established limits in order to produce consistent earnings that are not contingent upon favorable trends in interest rates 
this is attained by monitoring the levels of interest rates  the relationships between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities  the absolute amount of assets and liabilities which reprice or mature over similar periods  and the effect of all of these factors on the estimated level of net interest income 
there are a number of industry standards used to measure a financial institution s interest rate risk position 
most common among these is the one year gap which is the difference between assets and liabilities that will mature or reprice within one year expressed as a percentage of total assets 
using management s estimates of asset prepayments and core deposit decay in its computation  the company estimates that its cumulative one year gap position was liability sensitive by million or of total assets at december  the company also utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation not only considers the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also takes into consideration other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  customer preferences  and general market conditions 
the following table sets forth the amounts of assets and liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company to mature or reprice in each of the future time periods shown using certain assumptions based on its historical experience  the current interest rate environment  and other data available to management 
management believes that these assumptions approximate actual experience and considers such assumptions reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
management periodically reviews and  when appropriate  changes assumptions used in evaluating the company s interest rate sensitivity

fixed rate assets are scheduled by contractual maturity and adjustable rate assets are scheduled by their next repricing date 
in both cases  assets that have prepayment optionality are adjusted for the company s estimate of prepayments 
loans do not include non accrual loans of million 
loans do not include the allowance for loan loss of million 
in certain deposit categories where there is no contractual maturity  management assumed the sensitivity characteristics listed below based on the current interest rate environment and the company s historical experience 
management reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis and may modify them as circumstances dictate 
savings accounts are assumed to decay at an annual rate of 
now accounts are assumed to decay at an annual rate of 
money market accounts are assumed to decay at an annual rate of 
noninterest bearing accounts of million are included in other liabilities and are assumed to decay at an annual rate of 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  while certain assets and liabilities may have similar contractual maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different ways to changes in market interest rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
finally  the ability of borrowers to service their adjustable rate mortgages may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and general for the year ended december  the company reported net income of million  or per share fully diluted  as compared to net income of million  or per share fully diluted  for the year ended december  the financial results for and were favorably affected by nonrecurring tax events totaling million and million  respectively 
the company also experienced improved results in core earnings primarily attributed to increased net interest income and noninterest income as well as lower provisions for possible loan losses  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by the mix and volume of assets and liabilities  and the movement and level of interest rates 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  average balances  interest income and expense  and yields earned or rates paid on the major categories of assets and liabilities

income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  management evaluated the income tax benefits associated with temporary differences  based on the weight of available evidence  as to whether it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits would be realized 
as a result  a valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax asset was established at december  management reviews the valuation allowance on a periodic basis  and  based upon all available facts and circumstances at that time  may adjust the level of the allowance 
during both the fourth quarter of  and the third quarter of  management s evaluation of the weight of currently available evidence resulted in the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the company would realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset which was reserved for at those times 
at december   management reduced the company s valuation allowance from million to million  while at september   management reduced the remaining valuation allowance at that date of million to zero 
in both instances  management s judgment was influenced by factors including changes in the levels of actual and expected future taxable income and anticipated reversals of net deductible temporary differences 
also in the third quarter of  pursuant to the enactment of the small business jobs protection act during  the company was required  for tax purposes  to change its method of accounting for bad debts

as a result of this third quarter activity  the company became fully taxable for financial reporting purposes beginning in the fourth quarter of certain future distributions in excess of the bank s current earnings and profits would require the recapture of the taxes related to the pre loan loss reserves that were not subject to recapture under the small business job protection act 
the total tax liability that would be subject to recapture for which no deferred tax liability has been recorded is million 
impact of inflation monetary assets and liabilities are claims to receive or pay a sum of money  the amount of which is fixed 
most assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
in times of inflation  monetary assets lose purchasing power and monetary liabilities gain purchasing power because the obligations will be repaid with dollars that have less purchasing power than at the time the assets and liabilities were recorded 
since the company s primary source of earnings is net interest income  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s financial performance than the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
impact of accounting changes in march  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
sfas is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december   and was adopted by the company effective january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for mortgage service rights 
sfas amends certain provisions of sfas  accounting for certain mortgage banking activities  to eliminate the accounting distinction between rights to service mortgage loans for others that are acquired through loan origination activities and those acquired through purchase transactions 
sfas is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december   and was adopted by the company effective january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation which gives companies the option of employing intrinsic value accounting under the guidelines of accounting principles board apb no 
or fair value accounting for stock based compensation 
while sfas does not require the adoption of fair value accounting  it does require certain disclosures in the financial statements as if fair value accounting had been adopted  including pro forma net income and earnings per share 
the company adopted this accounting standard effective january  for disclosure purposes only and will continue to apply apb in accounting for stock based compensation 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  that provides accounting and reporting standards which require that after a transfer of financial assets  an entity recognizes the financial and servicing asset it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered  and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
in addition to setting requirements regarding the initial recording and subsequent accounting for assets  liabilities and derivatives acquired in transfers of financial assets  this statement requires that debtors reclassify financial assets pledged as collateral and that secured parties recognize those assets and their obligation to return them in certain circumstances in which the secured party has taken control of those assets 
sfas is effective prospectively for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december  and for collateral related matters on january  the company does not believe its adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position
