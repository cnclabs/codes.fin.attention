the cash requirements of funding the company s expansion have historically exceeded cash flow from operations 
accordingly  the company has satisfied its capital needs primarily through debt and equity financings 
the company currently anticipates that it will continue to satisfy its capital needs through additional debt or equity financing until the company has established an adequate number of profitable golf centers to support its growth through internal cash flow 
the company s outstanding indebtedness as of december  of million bears interest at fixed and variable rates currently ranging from to 
as of december  the company had  outstanding under its line of credit with chase bank 
the company has a million line of credit with chase bank and amounts outstanding under this credit line bear interest at the bank s prime 
chase bank has issued a commitment letter pursuant to which it has indicated that  subject to certain conditions  it will replace the current credit line with a two year million secured revolving credit facility  converting to a four year term loan at the end of the first two years 
the company anticipates making substantial additional expenditures in connection with the acquisition and opening of new golf facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities 
golf center opening expenditures primarily relate to projected golf center construction and opening costs  associated marketing activities and the addition of personnel 
from time to time  the company acquires  rather than leases  the land on which its golf centers are located  which entails additional expenditures 
based on the company s experience with its existing golf centers  the company believes that the cost of opening or acquiring a golf center generally will not exceed million exclusive of land costs 
however  there can be no assurance that golf center opening or acquisition costs will not exceed million 
golf center acquisition costs vary substantially depending on the location and status of the acquired property ie  whether significant capital improvements are necessary and whether the company acquires or leases the related land 
land acquisition costs vary substantially depending on a number of factors  including principally location 
to the extent that the company acquires any golf courses  the company may be required to make capital improvements to these courses  depending again upon the location and status of the acquired property 
the cost of golf course acquisitions depends  to a large extent  upon the price of the land and may substantially exceed the anticipated cost of golf center acquisitions 
the company intends to make capital improvements  estimated to aggregate approximately million over the next months  primarily on recently acquired facilities 
over the next months the company intends to utilize approximately all of the net proceeds from the offering  in addition to debt financing and issuances of its common stock  in connection with the acquisition and opening of golf facilities 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition of tpt  up to million of additional purchase price will be payable if certain operating income targets are achieved in the company believes that the net proceeds from the offering  cash flow from operations and its credit facility with chase bank will be sufficient to finance the company s currently contemplated expansion plans for at least the next months 
management does not believe that recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on the company s financial statements when adopted by the company 
effect of recently acquired facilities on a pro forma basis  as adjusted to give effect to acquisitions consummated after january  as if they had occurred as of january   the company had a net loss of  as compared to net income of million on a historical basis for the year ended december  and net income of million as compared to net income of million on a historical basis for the year ended december  although the recently acquired facilities have adversely affected income on a pro forma basis  the company believes that it will be able to i enhance revenues at such facilities by adding amenities including enclosed hitting areas  token based automated range ball dispensing machines  full line pro shops  miniature golf courses and hole golf courses and ii reduce expenses by economies of scale achieved through centralized purchasing  accounting  management information systems and cash management 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to improve the performance of newly acquired facilities 
seasonality historically  the second and third quarters have accounted for a greater portion of the company s operating income than have the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this is primarily due to an outdoor playing season limited by inclement weather 
although most of the company s facilities are designed to be all weather  portions of the facilities  such as miniature golf courses which are outdoors  tend to be vulnerable to weather conditions 
one of the company s golf centers and one golf course are closed during a portion of the winter 
also  golfers are less inclined to practice when weather conditions limit their ability to play golf on outdoor courses 
since august  the company has acquired golf centers in various locations arizona  california  virginia  georgia  south carolina and florida where inclement weather may not limit the outdoor playing season as much as such weather limits the outdoor playing season at the company s golf facilities in northern states 
this seasonal pattern  as well as the timing of new golf facility acquisitions and openings  may cause the company s results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
inflation there was no significant impact on the company s operations as a result of inflation during  or
