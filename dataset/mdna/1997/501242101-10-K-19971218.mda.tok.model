item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and company outlook the company s operating results primarily depend upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry historically has been highly volatile and has experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns which have had a severe negative effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment  including assembly equipment manufactured and marketed by the company and  to a lesser extent  packaging materials such as those sold by the company 
these downturns and slowdowns have also adversely affected the company s operating results  in particular  during the latter half of fiscal the company does not consider its business to be seasonal in nature 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from sales of a relatively small number of machines  most with selling prices ranging from  to over  a delay in the shipment of a limited quantity of machines  either due to manufacturing delays or to rescheduling or cancellations of customer orders  could have a material adverse effect on the results of the operations for any particular quarter 
the company believes that such volatility will continue to characterize the industry and the company s operations in the future 
the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries are subject to rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company believes that its continued success will depend upon its ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements and to introduce them into the market in response to demands for higher performance assembly equipment 
the company has developed and is in the process of transitioning to a new generation of wire bonders  the family  which is based on an entirely new platform and has required the development of new software and many subassemblies not part of the company s current wire bonders 
the first products in the family are the model ball bonder and model wedge bonder 
through fiscal  the company experienced delays in the development and introduction of the model such delays  which are typical in the development of new technological products  included hardware  software and process related issues and changes in functional specifications based on input from customers 
the company is shifting production capacity from the model plus to model ball bonders in response to growing backlog for model s  and expects model sales to exceed of total ball bonder sales for the fiscal first quarter 
the model was introduced during the fiscal fourth quarter with the sale of four production units 
additional model units have been sold during the fiscal first quarter  although recent delays in the production ramp up have been experienced 
while development and technical risks exist which have the potential to further affect the transition to the family wire bonders  the company expects the transition to volume production and sales of model and machines to continue through the first half of fiscal the company has incurred incremental costs to date and may incur substantial additional costs during the customer evaluation and qualification process to ensure the functionality and reliability of these new products 
the company s inability to successfully qualify new products  or its inability to manufacture and ship these products in volume and on a timely basis  could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
furthermore  the transition to the model and platforms involves numerous risks  including the possibility that customers will defer purchases of model plus and fp wire bonders in anticipation of the availability of the model or  or that the model or will fail to meet customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
to the extent that the company fails to accurately forecast demand in volume and configuration for both its current and next generation wire bonders and generally to manage product transitions successfully  it could experience reduced orders  delays in product shipments and increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce and manufacture new products  including the model and  that new products introduced by the company will be accepted in the marketplace or that the company will manage its product transitions successfully 
the company s failure to do any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
during fiscal  approximately of the company s sales were delivered to customer locations in the asia pacific region  including korea  taiwan  malaysia  japan  singapore and hong kong 
sales to customer locations in taiwan  korea and malaysia accounted for  and  respectively  of consolidated net sales in fiscal in recent months  certain of these countries have experienced significant instability in their financial markets and fluctuations in their local currencies relative to the us dollar 
the company does not believe these foreign financial market and currency fluctuations impacted its operations during fiscal however  certain korean based customers recently pushed out deliveries of machines originally scheduled for the company s fiscal first quarter  adversely affecting expected revenues and earnings for the period 
in addition  because most of the company s foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  the company believes that the increase in value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in recent months has made the company s products more expensive in relation to products offered by certain of the company s foreign competitors 
while pricing pressures associated with currency fluctuations have not been significant to date  there can be no assurance that selling prices in future orders will not be adversely impacted by these currency fluctuations 
in february  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with delco to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis and to license related technologies through fct 
fct completed construction of its manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona during fiscal  has commenced production runs involving limited quantities of wafers  and is currently working with additional customers to have its manufacturing processes qualified 
this qualification process is expected to continue into fiscal fct has experienced losses since its inception 
the company has recognized its proportionate share of such losses based on its equity interest  including a million loss during fiscal and a million loss in fiscal the company currently expects fct will incur additional losses during the first nine months of fiscal  but expects fct s operations to turn profitable by the fourth quarter of fiscal as previously announced by the company  sales and earnings for the company s first quarter of fiscal will be significantly lower than amounts reported for the fiscal fourth quarter 
this expected reduction reflects the effect of customers needing to assimilate the record number of machines purchased during fiscal  the longer than anticipated transition to the new model platform  rescheduling of shipments by certain korean based customers and delays in the model ramp up 
while the longer term effect of the asia pacific region s recent financial market instability on underlying demand for semiconductor devices and for semiconductor capital equipment  or its potential impact  if any  on future selling prices cannot currently be determined with certainty  the company s present outlook for the remainder of fiscal remains optimistic 
results of operations fiscal years ended september  and september  during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded bookings totaling million compared to million during fiscal the million increase in fiscal equipment bookings primarily reflected a significant improvement in demand for semiconductor assembly equipment  principally gold ball bonders  compared to the declining demand experienced throughout fiscal at september   total backlog of customer orders approximated million compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  the company s backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
net sales for the fiscal year increased by million to million from million in fiscal this improvement generally reflected a reversal of the fiscal trend of declining quarterly sales 
equipment segment net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  the company sold more than  ball bonders compared to slightly more than  units during fiscal additionally  increased unit sales of automatic dicing saws contributed to the fiscal increase 
these volume increases were offset  in part  by lower selling prices for the model plus ball bonder line compared to the average selling prices realized on ball bonders during fiscal  and by reduced unit sales of the model sp tab bonder in fiscal compared to fiscal packaging materials segment net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this increase  million was attributable to sales of hub blades following the october  semitec acquisition and million was due to increased sales volume of bonding wire  which was offset  in part  by the effect on revenues of declining gold prices 
international sales shipments of the company s products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of the company s total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region  including korea  taiwan  malaysia  philippines  japan  singapore  thailand and hong kong  accounted for approximately and of the company s total sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  total shipments including export sales to customers located in taiwan  korea and malaysia accounted for approximately  and of net sales  compared to  and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to the fiscal increased unit volume of equipment sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  with declines being experienced in both the equipment and packaging materials segments 
the equipment segment gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to lower average selling prices on ball bonders and reduced fiscal sales of higher margin upgrade kits and accessories compared to fiscal levels 
the packaging materials segment gross profit margin declined to in fiscal compared to in fiscal a shift in sales mix to lower margin wire products in fiscal was the primary reason for this decline 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase of million consisted of approximately million related to the equipment segment  million related to the packaging materials segment and 
million of incremental corporate costs 
fiscal sg a costs included incremental costs resulting from the october semitec acquisition  generally higher employment costs related to the increased sales volume  higher sales and management incentive compensation costs due to improved fiscal sales and profitability and costs incurred to relocate the company s micro swiss and afw singapore manufacturing operations into new facilities during the year 
the impact of these increases was offset  in part  by certain non recurring equipment segment and corporate costs incurred in connection with the company s august resizing initiatives 
research and development costs r d decreased to million in fiscal from million for the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the r d costs incurred were in the equipment segment  and reflected lower outside contract development costs and lower expenditures for prototype materials 
during fiscal  the company continued to invest heavily in the development of the series wire bonders and the enhancement of many of its existing products  including  but not limited to  the model plus ball bonder and model fp wedge bonder  to enable them to meet customer requirements for higher lead count devices with finer pitch requirements at faster bonding speeds 
the company also continues to invest in new technologies which may eventually lead to improved and alternative semiconductor assembly technologies 
gross r d expenditures were partially offset by funding received from customers and governmental subsidies totaling million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal operating income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this improvement resulted principally from the higher net sales and gross profit in the equipment segment  offset  in part  by the increased operating expenses noted above 
the packaging materials segment operating income declined to a break even level in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily reflecting costs incurred in fiscal to relocate the micro swiss and afw singapore operations to new facilities  severance costs and incremental costs to expand the packaging materials marketing and distribution organizations 
interest income  net of interest expense increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the investment of net proceeds from the company s may public offering of common stock 
during fiscal  the company recognized a million loss from its equity interest in fct compared to a loss of million in fiscal the increase in the loss in fiscal resulted from a full year of start up activities during fiscal compared to only a partial year of early start up activities during fiscal the company s effective tax rate increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the increase resulted largely from an increase in income attributable to operations in the united states 
this increase was offset in part by the reversal of valuation allowances established in prior years related to us tax credits 
the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the acquired domestic afw net operating loss nol and nol carryforwards of the company s japanese subsidiary  since the company cannot reasonably forecast sufficient future earnings by these subsidiaries to fully utilize the nol s during the carryforward period 
if benefits of the acquired nol carryforward are realized  such tax benefits would reduce the recorded amount of afw goodwill 
net income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 
fiscal years ended september  and september  during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded bookings totaling million  including approximately million related to afw  compared to million during fiscal which excluded afw s operating results 
the million decline in fiscal equipment bookings primarily reflected a significant reduction in demand for semiconductor assembly equipment  principally ball and wedge bonders  in the latter half of fiscal compared to the record levels experienced throughout fiscal and the first several months of fiscal the company believes that this decline reflected a high level of uncertainty and concern among the company s customers about then forecasted declines in personal computer sales  a significant drop in selling prices of memory chips  and with regard to the company s taiwan based customers  geopolitical uncertainty regarding china s reaction to elections in taiwan 
at september  total backlog of customer orders approximated million  including million relating to afw  compared to million at september  net sales for the fiscal year increased by million to million from million in fiscal the acquisition of afw contributed million to fiscal net sales 
equipment segment net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal total unit sales in fiscal were essentially flat compared to unit sales for fiscal however  sales of ball bonders  non semiconductor dicing saws and wire bonder upgrade kits increased in fiscal  while sales of aluminum wedge bonders declined in relation to the amounts sold in fiscal during fiscal  slightly improved selling prices were realized on the model ball bonder line compared to the average selling prices realized on ball bonders during fiscal on a quarterly basis  net sales declined sharply throughout fiscal  primarily in the equipment segment 
the decline generally reflected an industry wide slowdown in capital equipment purchases during as compared to the record levels experienced during packaging materials segment net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to million of sales of bonding wire products following the afw acquisition and million due to increased sales volumes of expendable tools 
international sales shipments of the company s products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of the company s total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region including korea  taiwan  malaysia  philippines  japan  singapore  thailand and hong kong accounted for approximately of the company s total sales in both fiscal and in fiscal  sales to customers located in malaysia  korea and philippines increased compared to fiscal levels  while sales to taiwan based customers declined significantly in fiscal the decline in taiwan  in part  reflected the impact of geopolitical uncertainty concerning china s reaction to the elections in taiwan 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margin declines were experienced in both the equipment segment and the packaging materials segment 
as a result of the rapid and substantial decline in customer demand for the company s equipment in the second half of fiscal  the company experienced unfavorable overhead absorption during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal provisions for excess and obsolete inventory totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the rapid decline in customer demand in fiscal  particularly for the model turbo ball bonders  and the anticipated transition to the new generation model gold ball bonders  caused the company to recognize approximately million of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter 
thus  equipment segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal from to for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the packaging materials segment decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease principally reflected the effect of the afw acquisition as sales of bonding wire products have historically had a substantially lower gross profit margin than the company s other products 
sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from to million in fiscal this increase of million consisted of approximately million related to the equipment segment  million related to the packaging materials segment  and million of incremental corporate costs 
in the equipment segment  higher employment and travel related costs  primarily in connection with the company s worldwide customer support activities during the first half of fiscal  contributed to the increase 
incremental goodwill amortization of million and other sg a costs of million associated with the afw operation accounted for the majority of the increase in the packaging materials segment 
higher sales commissions related to increased sales of expendable tools  increased travel costs related to afw integration activities and increased administrative costs to support the expanded worldwide activities of the packaging materials segment also contributed to the fiscal increase 
corporate costs grew principally as a result of implementation activities related to a new worldwide computer system 
in response to the rapid decline in customer demand for the company s products during the latter half of fiscal  the company reduced its world wide work force  primarily in the equipment segment  suspended the planned expansion of its willow grove  pennsylvania  facility  and deferred the implementation of a new worldwide integrated computer system 
as a result of these actions  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred severance costs totaling million and a million charge to write off costs incurred in connection with the suspended willow grove facility expansion 
r d costs increased to million in fiscal from million for the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the r d costs incurred were in the equipment segment 
approximately million of the increase was due to engineering activities associated with the family of products  principally the model development program 
the fiscal increase also included approximately million related to the write down of certain engineering prototype machines to their net realizable value 
the remaining r d spending increases related to development activities for other products and continuous improvements of existing products 
packaging materials segment r d costs increased to million as compared to fiscal levels 
substantially all of the r d spending in the packaging materials segment related to continuous improvement activities for existing products 
gross r d expenditures were partially offset by funding received from customers and governmental subsidies totaling million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal operating income declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decline largely resulted from higher operating costs in the equipment segment and to the decline in equipment segment gross profits during the latter half of fiscal most of the decline in operating income was realized in the united states as the united states operation incurred the majority of the company s r d expenses and corporate costs and recognized the majority of the fiscal fourth quarter charges 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to borrowings of million under the company s bank credit facility related to the financing of the company s october afw acquisition 
fiscal first quarter results included the write off of approximately  of costs incurred in connection with a proposed public offering of the company s common stock 
also  during fiscal  the company contributed million of capital to fct  and recognized a million loss as its proportionate share of the joint venture s operating results 
the company s effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the amount and geographic distribution of taxable income in fiscal in connection with the afw acquisition  the company acquired a million us federal nol carryforward 
during fiscal  afw s us manufacturing operation experienced a small loss 
since the company could reasonably forecast sufficient future us earnings by this subsidiary to fully utilize the acquired nol during the carryforward period  a valuation allowance was established for the full amount of this potential tax benefit 
if realized  such tax benefits would reduce the recorded amount of afw goodwill 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in february  statement of financial accounting standards no 
earnings per share sfas was issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb 
sfas redefines earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles and is effective for the company s fiscal first quarter ended december  under the new statement  primary earnings per share is replaced by basic earnings per share and fully diluted earnings per share is replaced by diluted earnings per share 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the effect of sfas no 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
the comprehensive income and related cumulative equity impact of comprehensive income items will be required to be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
only the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale are expected to be disclosed as potential additional components of the company s income under the requirements of sfas no 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which revises disclosure requirements related to operating segments  products and services  the geographic areas in which the company operates  and major customers 
the company intends to adopt this statement in the first quarter of fiscal and does not presently anticipate any material change in its disclosures following adoption of sfas liquidity and capital resources during the past three fiscal years  the company has financed its operations principally through cash flows from operations 
cash generated by operating activities totaled million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal cash and total investments increased to million at september  from at september  the increase in total cash and investments in fiscal was due largely to proceeds approximating million from the company s may sale of  shares of common stock  net of repayment of the million outstanding balance on the company s bank revolving credit facility 
at september   working capital increased to million compared to million at september  the accounts receivable balance increased by million during fiscal reflecting the significantly improved sales volumes throughout the latter half of the year 
gross inventory increased million at september   compared to the prior year end due to increased levels of work in process 
this increase in work in process was consistent with the growth in backlog 
trade accounts payable and accrued expenses at september  increased by million to million compared to the amounts at the end of fiscal the increases primarily resulted from increased inventory purchases associated with improved sales levels in fiscal and increased management incentive compensation accruals due to improved fiscal profitability 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in property and equipment  primarily to complete the construction of its micro swiss manufacturing facility in yokneam  israel  and to upgrade equipment used in the company s manufacturing and r d activities 
the company presently expects fiscal capital spending to approximate million 
the principal capital projects planned for fiscal include the purchase of additional tooling and equipment necessary to manufacture the series of machines  the purchase of equipment necessary to expand manufacturing capacity  primarily in the united states and israel  and additional investments in a new global management information system 
the company has initiated a project to replace existing business and accounting systems with an enterprise wide business system which is year compliant 
the company expects to incur capital expenditures  primarily for computer hardware and software  related to this system implementation project 
such amounts are included in the estimated capital expenditures discussed above 
internal staffing costs and reengineering costs  if any  associated with this system implementation project will be expensed as incurred 
the company s business system implementation plan currently anticipates conversion to the new enterprise business system by the beginning of its fiscal year 
accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate any material disruption in its business operations as a consequence of the year issue 
pursuant to the terms of the fct joint venture agreement  the company contributed to fct an aggregate of million through the end of fiscal in addition  the company loaned fct million during fiscal and  in october  agreed to provide an additional million in loans 
the company currently expects that an additional million to million of funding will be required by fct during fiscal  although the amount which may be funded by the company and its timing are presently uncertain 
the joint venture is subject to numerous risks common to business arrangements of this nature 
there can be no assurance that fct will ever become profitable  that the company will not make additional capital contributions and loans to fct or that the anticipated benefits of the joint venture will ever be realized 
if the joint venture were to not realize such benefits  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
a significant portion of the company s consolidated earnings are attributable to undistributed earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on that portion of undistributed foreign earnings which is expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
if funds were required to be repatriated to fund the company s operations or other financial obligations  substantial additional united states federal income tax expense could be required to be recognized 
the company currently has available the entire amount of a million revolving credit facility expiring february   which it expects to renew under comparable terms  and a million revolving credit facility expiring march  there were no borrowings under the million credit line during fiscal the company had outstanding the entire amount of the million revolving credit facility through may   at which time the loan was repaid from proceeds received in connection with the stock issuance 
the company intends to retain both of these revolving credit facilities 
the company believes that anticipated cash flows from operations  its working capital and amounts available under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  the company may seek  as required  equity or debt financing to provide capital for corporate purposes and or to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
the timing and amount of such potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for the company s products  semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions and competitive factors and the nature and size of strategic business opportunities which the company may elect to pursue
