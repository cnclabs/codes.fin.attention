results of operations net loss for the year ended august  was  or per share  compared to net earnings of  or per share for the year ended august  and  or per share for the year ended september  revenues for fiscal decreased  to  from  in fiscal  which compared to revenues of  in fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to focus on improved product quality and the development of new products 
direct broadcast satellite dbs revenues in fiscal decreased  to  from  in fiscal telecom and custom product revenues decreased  in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the decrease in dbs revenues was due to lower than expected orders for the digital product line and late deliveries of scheduled fiscal shipments 
the company believes that bookings of new orders were impacted by several factors 
customer decision processes were impacted by introductions of newer mpeg technology which resulted in longer evaluation periods of mpeg and mpeg technologies as well as competitors products and performance claims 
existing satellite transponder contracts  along with additional space segment becoming available  provided adequate transponder capacity for current service which resulted in networks deferring conversions to digital broadcasting 
budget decisions and constraints of certain broadcast network customers resulted in deferring placement of orders into fiscal orders by customers for products used in the distance learning markets are subject to state or federal funding approvals  which has resulted in the sales process taking from eighteen months to three years to complete 
the business tv market was impacted by an evaluation period during which customers defined their network requirements and compared equipment alternatives between low end non addressable network systems versus high end addressable networks 
as the market became segmented  sales efforts were focused on the market for addressable systems where the company believes it has a competitive advantage 
orders for digital audio products to convert existing analog radio networks to digital broadcasting were impacted by industry consolidations which have resulted in deferring purchasing decisions into fiscal late deliveries of scheduled fiscal deliveries resulted from delays in internally developed software and vendor design problems in a sole sourced assembly 
internally developed software was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal design changes by outside vendors and rework of related components were completed subsequent to fiscal the telecom and custom product group revenue decrease was primarily due to a higher level of shipments in fiscal of uplink equipment to radio networks for conversion from analog to digital broadcasting 
wci s backlog of orders scheduled to ship within eighteen months increased  or to  at august  from  at august  which compares to  at september  approximately   of the august  backlog is expected to ship during fiscal orders received subsequent to fiscal  which are scheduled to ship during fiscal amounted to  bringing the total orders received to date and expected to ship within fiscal to  the company expects to book sufficient additional orders to achieve its fiscal business plan which reflects an increase in revenues compared to fiscal and a return to profitability 
international sales are generated through a direct sales organization and through foreign distributors 
international sales were  or of revenues in fiscal  compared to  or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal management believes that international sales could increase as more business opportunities become available for wci products in the future 
all international sales are denominated in us dollars 
gross profit decreased  in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in profit margin dollars and percentages in fiscal compared to fiscal were mainly due to a sales mix of products with higher material costs which decreased margins by approximately  or of sales  lower revenues which decreased the margin contribution to cover fixed overhead costs by approximately  or of sales  and an increase in manufacturing overhead expenses of  or of sales  principally due to increases in amortization and write offs of capitalized software 
additionally  profit margins were adversely impacted by start up costs associated with the introduction of new digital video products and higher than expected material component costs of certain products 
the gross profit in fiscal was reduced by charges of  in reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory and by  for write offs of capitalized software 
these reserves resulted primarily from the need to reduce to net realizable value the inventory of slower moving  mature analog products and earlier generations of digital products 
these products continue to sell but at reduced rates 
this compares to an inventory reserve charge of  in fiscal and  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal the dollar increase of expenses in fiscal from fiscal includes increases in bad debt expense of  restructuring expense of  depreciation and amortization expense of  principally for loan origination fees and convertible bond issuance costs  and professional fees of  other increases of approximately  were due to higher levels of selling and marketing expenses and compensation expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal research and development expenditures  including capitalized software development costs  were  or of revenues in fiscal   or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in the dollar amount of expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to lower proto type material costs and consulting expenses which were partially offset by an increase in engineering personnel 
during fiscal   of software development costs were capitalized in accordance with sfas  and  and  of software development costs were capitalized in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses  excluding capitalized software development costs  were  or of revenues in fiscal   or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease during fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of total indebtedness including the convertible debentures

outlook issues and uncertainties the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
product introductions are generally characterized by increased functionality and better quality  sometimes at reduced prices 
the introduction of products embodying new technology may render existing products obsolete and unmarketable or marketable at substantially reduced prices 
the company s ability to successfully develop and introduce on a timely basis new and enhanced products that embody new technology  and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market will be a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and to remain competitive 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  the company s business and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
the company competes with companies which have substantially greater resources and a larger number of products than the company  as well as with small specialized companies 
competition in the emerging distance learning industry is comprised of both established firms as well as relative newcomers 
through relationships with satellite service providers  the company has positioned itself to provide end to end solutions to its customers 
competition in the market for the company s mpeg broadcast television electronics products  including digital video equipment  is driven by timeliness  performance  and price 
although design improvements continue  the company is delivering its broadcast digital video products which are aggressively priced  with unique  desirable features 
these products are physically smaller and priced below other equivalent products on the market today 
in addition  the company is beginning to market digital video products to cable networks  but  because the company is still a relative newcomer to cable program distribution  competition in this segment will be primarily against larger  more established entities 
due to the large number of potential end users  both small and large competitors continue to emerge 
competition for radio network products  including the company s digital audio products  is very aggressive and pricing is very competitive 
the company believes that its continued success in all of its markets will depend on aggressive marketing and product development 
the demand for digital products is being driven by the high cost of satellite capacity 
satellite capacity is scarce due to pressures on both the supply and demand side of the market 
on the supply side  satellites are extremely expensive to launch  build  and maintain 
the useful life of a satellite is limited by the amount of positioning fuel that can be carried 
also  the placement of satellites is regulated by the fcc and therefore the number of satellites within range of any given location is limited 
on the demand side  the cost of receive hardware is being steadily reduced through advancing technology 
the reduction in the cost of network hardware increases the economic feasibility of a greater number of networks 
this is evidenced by the trend in both television and radio towards narrow casting to well defined market segments as opposed to broadcasting to the general population 
digital compression technology allows a four to ten fold  or more  increase in the throughput of a satellite channel 
for the network  this compression represents an opportunity to reduce the cost of satellite use 
for the satellite operator it represents an opportunity to increase the revenue generated by an expensive asset 
due to existing satellite transponder contracts and the cost of replacing existing analog hardware  the digital conversion of major networks is taking longer than anticipated 
these network conversions are expected to occur in the near future  but it is impossible to predict the precise timing of customer s internal decision processes 
management believes the market as a whole has considerable built up demand for digital technology 
although no assurances can be given  the company expects to directly benefit from this increase in demand 
there may be fluctuations in the company s revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to several factors  including the timing of significant orders from customers and the timing of new product introductions by the company 
the company has invested a significant amount of financial resources to acquire certain raw materials  incur direct labor and contract to have specific outplant procedures performed on inventory in process 
as of august   approximately  of inventory was related to mpeg and mpeg digital components 
the company purchased this inventory based upon current backlog and anticipated future sales based upon existing knowledge of the marketplace 
the company s inventory reserve of  at august   is to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess  or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand  and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices 
no estimate can be made of a range of amounts of loss from obsolescence that are reasonably possible should the company s sales efforts not be successful 
the company s gross margin percentage is subject to variations based on the product mix sold in any period and on sales volumes 
start up costs associated with new product introductions could adversely impact costs and future margins 
the company believes margins could increase in fiscal if the company is successful in increasing revenues  improving manufacturing efficiencies  reducing start up costs on new products  achieving reductions in material costs with planned redesign of certain products  implementing other cost reductions  and streamlining operations to reduce costs 
however  there can be no assurance that increased margins will in fact be realized 
certain raw materials  video sub components  and licensed video processing technologies used in existing and future products are currently available from single or limited sources 
although the company believes that all single source components currently are available in adequate quantities  there can be no assurance that shortages or unanticipated delivery interruptions will not develop in the future 
any disruption or termination of supply of certain single source components or technologies could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has made significant investments in capitalized software costs principally related to the digital audio and video products 
at august  capitalized software costs were  these costs are being amortized over anticipated future gross revenues for the product or the estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes  and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives 
during fiscal   of capitalized software costs were written off to cost of sales due to a reduction of expected revenues on certain slow moving products 
the industry in which the company operates is subject to rapid technology changes and frequent product introductions 
the company expects to remain committed to such research and development expenditures as are required to effectively compete and maintain pace with the rapid technological changes in the communications industry and to support innovative engineering and design in its future products 
the company had an accumulated deficit of  at august  the company is very focused on controlling both direct and indirect manufacturing costs and other operating expenses 
these costs will be adjusted as necessary if the revenues of the company do not increase as planned 
management believes that digital compression technology may be profitably employed to create increased demand for its satellite receiving equipment if those products are manufactured in a high volume standardized production environment 
while no assurances may be given  management believes that implementation of the current business plan for fiscal will result in increased revenues compared to fiscal and a return to profitability
