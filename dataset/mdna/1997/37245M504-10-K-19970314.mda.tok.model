the company s equity in net loss of joint venture totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in the company s share of genta jago s net loss during relative to is largely attributable to the fact that development efforts are now focused exclusively on geomatrix based products and a greater portion of development activities were funded pursuant to genta jago s collaborative agreements with third parties
