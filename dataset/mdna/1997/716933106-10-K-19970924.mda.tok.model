the company may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories
