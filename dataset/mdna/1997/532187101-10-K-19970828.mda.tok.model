growth in the hyaluronate division is unpredictable due to the complex governmental regulatory environment for new medical products and the early stage of certain of these markets

no assurance can be given that the company will attain and maintain positive cash flow before its capital resources are exhausted 
while the company s capital resources appear adequate today  unforeseen events  prior to achieving and maintaining positive cash flow  could require additional financing
