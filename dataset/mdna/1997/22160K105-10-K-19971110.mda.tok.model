costco wholesale corporation began operations in in seattle  washington with a similar membership warehouse concept 
costco companies  inc formerly price costco  inc 
prior to a name change approved by the shareholders in january  a delaware corporation  publicly traded under the nasdaq ticker symbol cost  was formed in october as a result of a merger of costco wholesale corporation and the price company 
costco companies  inc is the parent company of costco wholesale corporation and the price company which operate membership warehouses primarily under the costco wholesale name 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed a spin off of price enterprises  inc price enterprises  consisting of costco s discontinued non club commercial real estate operations and certain other assets 
see note spin off of price enterprises  inc and discontinued operations 
general costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover 
this rapid inventory turnover  when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing  efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no frills  self service warehouse facilities  enables costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers  discount retailers and supermarkets 
costco buys nearly all of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to costco s selling warehouses or to a consolidation point depot where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs 
as a result  costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels  which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers  use of central receiving  storing and distributing warehouses  and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 
by providing this more cost effective means of distributing goods  costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers  and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source 
in addition  these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases 
individuals shopping for their personal needs are primarily motivated by the cost savings on brand name merchandise 
costco s merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label products  often in case  carton or multiple pack quantities  at attractively low prices 
because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover  costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors  even though costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts 
as sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid  a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital 
costco s typical warehouse format averages approximately  square feet 
floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space  in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory 
because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods  costco s warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities 
by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and by limiting membership to selected groups and businesses  costco has been able to limit inventory losses to less than one half of one percent of net sales well below those of typical discount retail operations 
losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal  since individual memberships are limited primarily to members of qualifying groups  and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit 
memberships are invalidated at the point of sale for those members who have issued dishonored checks to costco 
costco s policy is generally to limit advertising and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings and occasional direct mail advertisements to prospective new members 
these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets 
in connection with new warehouse openings  costco s marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area who are potential wholesale members 
these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening 
potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct mail generally distributed through credit unions  employee associations and other entities representing individuals who are eligible for gold star membership 
after a membership base is established in an area  most new memberships result from word of mouth advertising  follow up contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups  and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members 
costco s warehouses generally operate on a seven day  hour week  and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season 
generally  warehouses are open weekdays between am and am  with earlier closing hours on the weekend 
because these hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional discount grocery retailers and supermarkets  labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales 
merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item  thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 
in addition  sales are processed through centralized  automated check out stands 
items are not individually price marked  rather  each item is bar coded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers 
this allows price changes without remarking merchandise 
substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise pre marked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special  larger package sizes 
costco s merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers  discount retailers or supermarkets 
an important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which costco can provide its members significant cost savings 
items which members may request but which cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are usually not carried 
costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models  sizes and colors and therefore carries only an average of approximately  to  active stockkeeping units sku s per warehouse as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets which normally stock  to  sku s or more 
these practices are consistent with costco s membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members  thereby encouraging high volume shopping 
many consumable products are offered for sale in case  carton or multiple pack quantities only 
appliances  equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models 
costco s policy is to accept returns of merchandise within a reasonable time after purchase 
the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by costco during fiscal  and sundries including candy  snack foods  health and beauty aids  tobacco  alcoholic beverages  soft drinks and cleaning and institutional supplies food including dry and fresh foods and institutionally packaged foods hardlines including major appliances  video and audio tape  electronics  tools  office supplies  furniture and automotive supplies softlines including apparel  domestics  cameras  jewelry  housewares  books and small appliances other including pharmacy  optical  one hour photo  print shop  hearing aid and gas stations costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise 
no significant portion of merchandise is obtained by costco from any one of these or any other single supplier 
costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise  and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became unavailable  it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business 
costco also purchases different national brand name or selected private label merchandise of the same product  as long as cost  quality and customer demand are comparable 
costco reports on a week fiscal year  consisting of four week periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august 
the first  second and third quarters consist of three periods each  and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a week year 
there is no material seasonal impact on costco s operations  except an increased level of sales and earnings during the christmas holiday season 
membership policy costco s membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue 
costco has two primary types of members business and gold star individual members 
businesses  including individuals with a business license  retail sales license or other evidence of business existence  may become business members 
costco promotes business membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs 
business members generally pay an annual membership fee of for the primary membership card with additional membership cards available for an annual fee of individual memberships are available to employees of federal  state and local governments  financial institutions  corporations  utility and transportation companies  public and private educational institutions  and other selected organizations 
individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of  which includes a spouse card 
as of august   costco had approximately million business memberships and approximately million gold star memberships 
members can utilize their memberships at any wholesale location 
labor as of august   costco had approximately  employees  about of which were part time 
approximately  hourly employees in california  maryland  new jersey  new york and one warehouse in virginia are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters 
all remaining hourly employees are non union 
costco considers its employee relations to be good 
competition the company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry 
when the price company pioneered the membership warehouse club concept in  the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores  grocery stores and traditional wholesalers 
since then  new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment 
wal mart has become the largest retailer in the united states and has expanded into food merchandising 
target has also emerged as a significant retail competitor 
approximately warehouse clubs exist across the us and canada  including the warehouses operated by the company in north america  and every major metropolitan area has some  if not several  club operations 
low cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise  such as home depot  office depot  petsmart  toys r us  circuit city and barnes noble  have significant market share in their respective categories 
new forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in stores such as the sharper image  while home shopping and electronic commerce over the internet is becoming increasingly popular 
likewise  in the institutional food business  companies such as smart final  which operates in arizona  california and florida  are capturing an increasingly greater share of the institutional food business from wholesale operators and others  and many supermarkets now offer food lines in bulk sizes and at prices comparable to those offered by the company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulation certain state laws require that the company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods  such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages 
while compliance with such laws may cause the company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge  other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions  and the company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations 
it is the policy of the company to sell at lower than manufacturers suggested retail prices 
some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices 
to date  the company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers 
both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which  if enacted  would restrict the company s ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices 
the company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation
