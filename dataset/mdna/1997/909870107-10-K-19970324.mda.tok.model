products and production 
the company s principal products are home equity loans with a fixed amount and term to maturity  which are secured by a first lien mortgage on the borrower s residence

these loans are distinct from home equity revolving lines of credit  which are generally secured by a second mortgage and typically carry a floating interest rate 
the company offers fixed rate and adjustable rate arm home equity loan products 
in addition to home equity loans  the company offers manufactured housing loan products made primarily to finance the purchase of new or used manufactured homes 
these contracts are typically secured by i a security interest in the manufactured home purchased with the proceeds of such contracts or ii with respect to certain of the contracts  liens on the real estate to which the related manufactured homes are deemed permanently affixed 
the company also began offering in mid a secured credit card product which is presently targeted to the company s home equity loan customer base

   as of december   approximately in aggregate principal amount of the home equity loans owned and or serviced by the company were secured by a first mortgage with the remaining in aggregate principal amount secured by second or multi property mortgages 
during  approximately billion in first mortgage home equity loans and million in second mortgage and multi property home equity mortgage loans were originated or acquired by the company 
in the case of most home equity loans for home improvements  the loan proceeds are disbursed to an escrow agent which  according to guidelines established by the company  releases such proceeds upon completion of the improvements or in draws as the work on the improvements progresses 
the weighted average interest rate on home equity loans produced during was  compared to during costs incurred by the borrower for loan origination  including origination points and appraisal  legal and title fees  are often included in the amount financed 
the company s principal market for its home equity loans is individuals who may not otherwise qualify for conventional loans which are readily marketable to the government sponsored mortgage agencies or conduits and available through most commercial banks and many other lending institutions 
loans to such borrowers may present a greater credit risk and therefore produce higher loan origination fees and interest rates as compared to loans to customers of banks and thrifts 
the company believes that its customers generally place a higher priority on the amount of the monthly payment and prompt credit approval than on the interest rate and origination fees associated with the loan 
management of the company believes that any greater credit risk arising out of making loans to these borrowers is compensated by higher fees and interest rates 
there are generally numerous competitors for these borrowers in each of the company s geographic markets 
principal competitors include recognized national and regional lenders 
the company believes that prompt underwriting and response to loan applications provides a competitive advantage in loan originations 
the company s manufactured housing lending program is primarily conducted through ucfi 
ucfi may i purchase contracts from approved manufactured housing dealers indirect financing  ii originate contracts directly with individual owners or purchasers of manufactured homes direct financing or iii make bulk purchases of contracts originated or acquired by other lending institutions or finance companies 
these contracts are generally secured by a security interest in the manufactured home purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
through its affiliates  ucfi also originates contracts land and home contracts which  in addition to being secured by security interests in the manufactured homes  are secured by liens on the real estate to which the manufactured homes are deemed permanently affixed 
manufactured home contracts are generally subject to minimum down payments of approximately of the amount financed and the term of the contracts do not exceed years 
at december   ucfi was licensed to conduct business in states 
through its regional managers  ucfi purchases manufactured housing contracts from manufactured housing dealers 
ucfi s regional managers contact dealers located in their region and explain ucfi s available financing plans  terms  prevailing rates and credit and financing policies 
if the dealer wishes to use ucfi s available customer financing  the dealer must make an application for dealer approval 
upon satisfactory results of ucfi s investigation of the dealer s creditworthiness and general business reputation  ucfi and the dealer execute a dealer agreement 
as of december   the dealers with which ucfi has entered into dealer agreements are located in states 
ucfi provides indirect financing only for manufactured homes which are manufactured by an approved manufacturer 
approval may be requested by a dealer or a manufacturer 
if ucfi s review of the manufacturer s creditworthiness and general business reputation is satisfactory  ucfi will approve the manufacturer s products as being eligible for indirect financing 
all contracts that ucfi purchases from dealers are written on forms provided by ucfi and are purchased on an individually approved basis 
the dealer submits the customer s credit application and purchase order to ucfi s executive offices where ucfi s underwriters make an analysis of the creditworthiness of the proposed buyer 
if the application meets ucfi s guidelines and the credit is approved  ucfi purchases the contract after the manufactured home is delivered and set up and the customer has been contacted by telephone to obtain the customer s approval of the manufactured home and the delivery and set up of the manufactured home 
financing is also provided directly to individuals who own or wish to purchase manufactured homes 
the customer s credit application is submitted to ucfi or one of its affiliate s executive offices where the underwriters make an analysis of the creditworthiness of the customer 
a customer s application will also be accepted over a toll free telephone number established for that purpose 
if the telephone application receives preliminary approval  it is further processed as with other customer applications 
manufactured housing contracts originated or acquired by other lending institutions or finance companies may also be purchased by the company 
each contract so purchased will be re underwritten prior to the purchase thereof using the then current underwriting standards 
underwriting 
home equity loans 
supervision of the underwriting staff is centralized  however  each of the company s distribution networks for home equity loans has its own staff of underwriters in order to provide better service to its respective customers 
regardless of the manner of origination  all home equity loans are underwritten or  in the case of bulk purchases  are re underwritten prior to approval and funding utilizing substantially similar underwriting guidelines 
the underwriting function is centralized at the home office 
underwriting guidelines are modified from time to time 
the following is a description of the current underwriting guidelines  which are not materially different from prior guidelines 
the underwriting process is intended to assess the prospective borrower s ability and willingness to repay the loan and the adequacy of the real property security as collateral for the loan granted 
on a case by case basis  home equity loans may be made which vary from the underwriting guidelines  however  such variations are approved by the home office underwriting department 
the company originates fixed rate home equity loans with original terms to maturity not to exceed months for single family  owner occupied first mortgages  months for single family  non owner occupied first mortgages  months for single family  combination owner occupied rental property first mortgages  and months for single family  owner occupied second mortgages 
the fixed rate loan amounts generally do not exceed  in the case of loans secured by first liens  and  in the case of loans secured by second liens  in each case unless a higher amount is specifically approved by the applicable underwriters 
all of the fixed rate home equity loans are fully amortizing  except for balloon loans which comprise of the portfolio 
unicor originates and the company s other distribution networks may originate fixed rate loans with an original term to maturity ranging from to months and a longer amortization schedule ranging from to months balloon loans 
balloon loans must be secured by first liens on residential properties 
unicor and ginger mae also originate fixed rate home equity loans which provide that the interest rate may decrease by one percentage point if the borrower makes the first consecutive monthly payments without a delinquency 
at that time  the monthly payments will be recalculated to fully amortize the loan at the reduced rate over the remaining term to maturity 
adjustable rate home equity loans generally amortize fully over a period not to exceed months 
the maximum loan amount for adjustable rate home equity loans is  unless a higher amount is specifically approved by the applicable underwriters 
the homes used for collateral to secure the home equity loans may be owner occupied  non owner occupied rental properties or a combination of owner occupied rental properties  which in any case are one to four family residences which may be a detached or semi detached row house  townhouse  a condominium unit or a unit in a planned unit development 
in addition  such loans may be secured by single family owner occupied manufactured or mobile homes with land if the manufactured or mobile homes are permanently affixed and defined as real estate under applicable state law 
certain loans may be secured by a leasehold interest and the improvements thereon 
second mortgages are generally permitted only for fixed rate home equity loans and generally are limited to one to four family owner occupied property 
such a loan secured by a second mortgage typically will not be made if the first mortgage is a balloon or an individual or owner financed mortgage 
in general  the value of each property proposed as security for a home equity loan is required to be determined by a current appraisal from an independent appraiser who has been approved by the home office 
the company requires that the appraisal provide an adequately supported estimate of the value of the property proposed as security for the requested home equity loan and a complete  accurate description of the property 
in some cases  the appraisal is subject to completion of improvements which are to be made with the proceeds of the home equity loan 
the property is analyzed  based on the appraisal  to determine its acceptability as security for the loan requested 
manufactured housing contracts 
the underwriting of manufactured housing contracts focuses primarily on the borrower s willingness and capacity to repay the debt 
the analysis includes application of a credit scoring system and a review of the applicant s paying habits  length and likelihood of continued employment  and certain other factors 
the company s current underwriting guidelines for conventional contracts limit the maximum loan size to  in the case of chattel contracts ie  manufactured housing installment sales contracts and manufactured housing installment loan agreements and  in the case of land and home contracts ie  contracts where the manufactured home is deemed permanently affixed to the real estate on which it is located 
appraisals on used manufactured homes are performed by employees of the company or by independent appraisers approved by the company 
the appraisals of such independent appraisers are validated by the company s personnel through a review of the national automobile dealers association base values and on site inspections 
the company applies substantially the same loan to value ratio  appraisal and other underwriting standards and procedures to the land and home contracts as are applied to other home equity loans 
loan to value 
home equity loans 
the total amount of a home equity loan generally includes origination fees  credit life insurance premium  if any  prepaid interest and other closing costs such as the cost of an appraisal report and title insurance premiums 
loan to value is the percentage equal to the note amount divided by the lesser of appraised value or the purchase price of the real estate 
for fixed rate and adjustable rate home equity loans originated through the company s wholesale operations  the maximum loan to value is  with the maximum for rural properties generally being 
for home equity loans originated through the branch network  an underwriting loan to value ratio  as described below  is utilized 
the total amount of a home equity loan  net of the origination fees  credit life insurance premium  if any  prepaid tax and insurance escrow  real estate tax service fee  loan application fee and prepaid interest  is defined as the cash out 
the underwriting loan to value ratio for underwriting purposes is the cash out divided by the appraised value or purchase price of the property  whichever is less 
the cash out with respect to fixed rate and adjustable rate loans originated through the branch network is limited to of the lesser of the applicable appraised value or purchase price of the property 
generally  the maximum underwriting loan to value ratio is for a loan with a second mortgage on the property 
with respect to rural properties  the maximum underwriting loan to value ratio utilizing only up to ten acres and the improvements thereon is 
the maximum underwriting loan to value ratio generally applicable to non owner occupied homes is and is generally for owner occupied manufactured mobile homes with land 
because the underwriting loan to value ratio is based on the cash out rather than the actual principal balance of the related loan  the loan to value ratio of such loan will be higher and could be substantially higher than the underwriting loan to value ratio 
however  the loan to value ratio may not exceed 
manufactured housing contracts 
the value used to calculate the original loan to value ratios of the contracts originated by ucfi is equal to i in the case of a chattel contract on a new manufactured home  the total cost of such manufactured home allowing for the standard industry dealer markup of  including sales and other taxes  filing and recording fees imposed by law and premiums for related insurance and optional equipment up to of the base invoice and set up fees  ii in the case of a chattel contract on a used manufactured home  either the total delivered sales price for such manufactured home  if available  or its appraised market value  plus  in either case  each of the following to the extent that the inclusion thereof does not exceed the appraised value of the manufactured home sales and other taxes  filing and recording fees imposed by law and premiums for related insurance  or iii in the case of real estate securing a land and home contract  the total sales price of the real estate and the manufactured home together 
value used to calculate the original loan to value ratios of manufactured housing contracts originated by other distribution networks of the company or acquired from third parties will equal the lesser of the appraised value or  in the case of a purchase  the purchase price of the manufactured home and the related real estate to which the manufactured home is permanently affixed 
with respect to conventional chattel contracts for new manufactured homes  the company may finance up to the lesser of a of the cash sale price including taxes  fees and insurance of the manufactured home or b of the manufacturer s invoice price of the manufactured home plus of taxes  license fees and freight charges  of the dealer s cost of additional dealer installed equipment not to exceed of the base price of the manufactured home  and up to  of set up costs per module 
with respect to used manufactured homes  the company may finance up to of the lesser of a the total delivered sales price of the manufactured home including taxes  fees  insurance and up to  of set up costs per module  or b the appraised value of the manufactured home 
taxes  fees  and insurance may be included in the amount financed up to a maximum of of the appraised value of the used manufactured home 
the guidelines in this paragraph may be exceeded when the company s underwriters deem it appropriate 
creditworthiness 
home equity loans manufactured housing contracts 
verification of personal financial information for each applicant is required 
the applicant s total monthly obligations including principal and interest on each mortgage  tax assessments  other loans  charge accounts and all scheduled indebtedness generally should not exceed of a borrower s gross monthly income 
in the case of adjustable rate home equity loans  the debt ratio calculation is based upon the principal and interest payment amount utilizing the maximum rate on the second change date 
generally  the borrowers are required to have two years of employment with their current employer or two years of like experience 
applicants who are salaried employees must provide current employment information in addition to recent employment history 
this information is verified for salaried borrowers based on written confirmation from employers  or a combination of a telephone confirmation from the employer and the most recent pay stub and the most recent w tax form 
a self employed applicant is generally required to provide copies of complete federal income tax returns filed for the most recent two years 
re verification of the foregoing information is generally not undertaken for home equity loans purchased through the bulk purchase program of the company 
a credit report by an independent  nationally recognized credit reporting agency reflecting the applicant s credit history is required 
the credit report should reflect all delinquencies of days or more  repossessions  judgments  foreclosures  garnishments  bankruptcies and similar instances of adverse credit that can be discovered by a search of public records 
verification is required to be obtained of the first mortgage balance  if any  its status and whether local taxes  interest  insurance and assessments are included in the applicant s monthly payment 
all taxes and assessments not included in the payment are required to be verified as current 
a borrower s mortgage payment history should generally reflect no more than three payments over days delinquent in the last twelve months  however  in some cases  a borrower is permitted to have no more than five payments over days delinquent in the last twelve months and one payment over days delinquent in the last twelve months 
credit analysis is subjective and subject to interpretation in the underwriting process 
other requirements 
the company generally requires title insurance coverage on each home equity loan or land and home manufactured housing contract it originates 
the borrower is required to obtain property insurance in an amount sufficient to cover  in the case of a first mortgage  the new loan and in the case of a fixed rate second mortgage  the new loan and any prior mortgage 
if the sum of an outstanding first mortgage  if any  and the fixed rate home equity loan exceeds the lesser of replacement or insurable value  insurance equal to the lesser of replacement or insurable value may be accepted 
the company requires that its name and address are properly added to the mortgagee clause of the insurance policy 
in the event the policy does not provide for written notice of policy changes or cancellation  an endorsement adding such provision is required 
the borrower is required to obtain flood insurance to the extent such insurance is available under the flood disaster protection act of  as amended 
after a loan is underwritten  approved and funded  the mortgage loan packages are reviewed by home office loan review personnel 
a random sample of the mortgage loan packages are subsequently subjected to a quality control audit 
loan sales and securitizations 
substantially all of the home equity loans and manufactured housing contracts originated or purchased by the company are sold 
since  the company has sold home equity loans originated by it in the secondary market  initially in transactions with government sponsored mortgage agencies or conduits  later in private placement transactions with financial institutions and  since the second quarter of  through shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission by subsidiaries of the company 
approximately billion of pass through certificates backed primarily by first mortgage home equity loans originated or purchased by the company through its distribution networks have been issued under the registration statements and publicly sold since during  a subsidiary of the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the sale of manufactured housing contract pass through certificates 
the registration statement was declared effective in september of and the company issued and publicly sold approximately million of such certificates during the third and fourth quarters of the company intends to continue to effect securitization transactions on a quarterly basis  but the amount and timing of sales of securities under the shelf registration statements will depend upon market and other conditions affecting the operations of the company 
the following table reflects certain information regarding home equity loan production and sales during the indicated periods home equity loan production 











   home equity loan sales 













   average coupon on loans sold 










interest spread retained on loans sold 





the weighted average interest spread on loans sold the difference between the stated rate on the loan and the rate paid to purchasers  less certain recurring fees is determined without regard to expected credit losses 
servicing rights are retained on substantially all loans sold 
the company s home equity loan securitization transactions are credit enhanced and the certificates issued pursuant thereto have received ratings of aaa from moody s investors service  inc  aaa from standard poor s  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc and aaa from fitch investors service lp credit enhancement is achieved in part through a guaranty provided by a third party insurer and by subordinating an amount the subordinated amount of the excess interest spread retained by the company to the payment of scheduled principal and interest on the certificates should there be a shortfall in collections from borrowers in the form of monthly mortgage payments during any given period 
if cumulative payment defaults exceed the subordinated amount  the third party insurer is obligated to pay any further losses experienced by the owners of the pass through certificates 
the company has  from time to time  used the financial guaranty insurance company and mbia insurance corporation as third party insurers 
credit enhancement for one of the manufactured housing securitization transactions was achieved in part through a guaranty provided by a third party insurer and by a senior subordinated structure for the other transaction 
the certificates issued pursuant to the manufactured housing securitizations have received investment grade ratings by nationally recognized rating agencies 
each pooling and servicing agreement that governs the distribution of cash flows from the pooled loans requires the establishment of an account the reserve account that may require an initial deposit by the company 
thereafter  a portion of the excess interest is deposited in the reserve account 
there are no events that will require the aggregate deposits to the reserve account to exceed the related subordinated amount 
to the extent that losses are incurred on the loans underlying the pass through certificates issued in a securitization transaction  such losses are paid out of the related reserve account to the extent that funds are available 
the company derives a significant portion of its income by realizing gains upon the sale of home equity loans and manufactured housing contracts sometimes referred to collectively herein as loans due to the excess servicing income of such loans 
excess servicing income represents the excess of the interest rate payable by a borrower on a loan over the interest rate passed through to the investor acquiring an interest in such loan  less the company s normal servicing fee and other applicable recurring fees 
when loans are sold  the company recognizes as current income the present value of the excess servicing income expected to be realized over the anticipated average life of the loans sold less future estimated credit losses relating to the loans sold 
at december   the company s balance sheet reflected capitalized excess servicing income of approximately million 
the company s allowance for loan losses includes an allowance of approximately million for loans serviced 
the capitalized excess servicing income is computed using prepayment  default and interest rate assumptions that the company believes market participants would use for similar instruments at the time of sale 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of the balance of capitalized excess servicing income on home equity loans reflected on the company s balance sheet at december   was approximately 
the company is not aware of an active market for this kind of receivable 
no assurance can be given that this receivable could in fact be sold at its stated value on the balance sheet 
capitalized excess servicing income is amortized over the lesser of the estimated or actual remaining life of the underlying loans as an offset against the excess servicing income component of servicing income actually received in connection with such loans 
although management of the company believes that it has made reasonable estimates of the excess servicing income likely to be realized  it should be recognized that the rate of prepayment and the amount of defaults utilized by the company are estimates and actual experience may vary from these estimates 
the company periodically reviews its prepayment assumptions in relation to current rates of prepayment and  if necessary  writes down the remaining asset to the net present value of the estimated remaining future excess servicing income 
rapid increases in interest rates or competitive pressures may result in a reduction of excess servicing income  thereby reducing the gains recognized by the company upon the sale of loans in the future 
the gain recognized by the company upon the sale of loans will have been overstated if the excess servicing income actually received by the company is less than originally assumed 
an acceleration of future prepayments and or delinquencies could result in capitalized excess servicing income amortization expense exceeding realized excess servicing income  thereby adversely affecting the company s servicing income 
conversely  if the rate of prepayment and or delinquencies is less than the amount assumed in determining loan sale gains  servicing income will be positively affected in future periods 
the ability of the company to sell loans and or mortgage backed securities in the secondary market  or an alternative source of funding loan production  is essential for continuation of the company s loan origination operations 
a prolonged  substantial reduction in the size of the secondary market for home equity loans may adversely affect the company s ability to sell its loan originations and or mortgage backed securities in the secondary market with consequent adverse impact on the company s profitability and future originations 
moreover  market and other considerations could affect the timing of the company s securitization transactions and delays in such sales could reduce the amount of gains recognized from the sale of loans in a given quarter 
loan servicing 
the company retains the servicing on substantially all loans it originates 
the following services are performed for investors to whom the company has sold loans and for which it has retained servicing investor reporting  collecting and remitting periodic principal and interest payments to investors and performing other administrative services  including maintaining required escrow accounts for payment of real estate taxes and standard hazard insurance  determining the adequacy of standard hazard insurance  advising investors of delinquent loans  conducting foreclosure proceedings  and inspecting and reporting on the physical condition of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans  and disposing of foreclosed properties 
the company is generally obligated to advance interest on delinquent loans to the secondary market investors at the applicable pass through rate until satisfaction of the note  liquidation of the mortgaged property or charge off of the loan 
to the extent that the amount recovered through liquidation of collateral is insufficient to cover the unpaid balance of the loan  the company incurs a loss until such losses aggregate the limit specified in the related loan sale agreement 
in connection with its servicing activities  the company sends to borrowers monthly statements that specify the fixed payment amount and due date in the case of fixed rate home equity loans and the adjusted payment amount and due date in the case of adjustable rate home equity loans and the late payment amount  if any 
with respect to adjustable rate home equity loans  the company provides written notices to borrowers of upcoming rate adjustments reflecting the adjusted payment amounts 
the company  as master servicer  is required under each loan sale agreement to service the mortgage loans or manufactured housing contracts  as the case may be  either directly or through sub servicers 
substantially all servicing activities are centralized at the home office 
the contractual balances of loans owned and or serviced  excluding real estate owned and or serviced  by the company were as follows for the dates indicated december  in thousands owned and serviced home equity

this amount may include the first mortgage balance  delinquent first mortgage payments and certain advances made on the property 
when the company believes that borrowers with existing loans with the company are likely to refinance such loans due to interest rate changes  equity build up or other reasons  the company actively attempts to retain such borrowers through solicitations of such borrowers to refinance with the company 
such refinancings generate fee income and servicing income for the company 
delinquency and loss experience 
the following two tables set forth information relating to delinquency  default and loan loss experience for the home equity loan portfolio serviced by the company including loans owned by the company as of the dates and for the periods indicated december  dollars in thousands number of home equity loans

delinquent manufactured housing contracts which for purposes hereof includes land and home contracts and chattel contracts totaled million  or of the manufactured housing contracts owned and or serviced at december  the above delinquency  default and loan loss experience represents the company s recent experience 
however  the delinquency  default and net loss percentages may be affected by the increase in the size and relative lack of seasoning of a substantial portion of the portfolio 
in addition  the company can neither quantify the impact of property value declines  if any  on the home equity loans nor predict whether  to what extent or how long  such declines may exist 
in a period of such declines  the rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses on the home equity loans could be higher than those theretofore experienced in the residential mortgage lending industry in general 
adverse economic conditions which may or may not affect real property values may affect the timely payment by borrowers of scheduled payments of principal and interest on the home equity loans and  accordingly  the actual rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses 
as a result  the information in the above tables should not be considered as a basis for assessing the likelihood  amount or severity of delinquencies  defaults or losses in the future on home equity loans and no assurance can be given that the delinquency  default and loss experience presented in the tables will be indicative of such experience on home equity loans

competition as a marketer of credit products  the company faces intense competition 
traditional competitors in the financial services business include other mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  credit unions  thrift institutions  credit card issuers and finance companies 
many of these competitors in the financial services business are substantially larger and have more capital and other resources than the company 
competition can take many forms including convenience in obtaining a loan  customer service  marketing and distribution channels and interest rates 
in addition  the current level of gains realized by the company and its existing competitors on the sale of its and their non conventional loans could attract additional competitors into this market with the possible effect of lowering gains on future loan sales as the result of increased loan origination competition

the operations of uclic  ugtic and fmc have been reclassified as discontinued operations and the prior years financial statements of the company included herewith have been restated accordingly 
during the third quarter of  the company implemented  on a prospective basis  the provisions of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein and identifies the major factors which influenced the results of operations of the company during the indicated periods 
the company s lending operations primarily consist of the production by origination or purchase  sale and servicing of first mortgage  non conventional  home equity loans 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expanded its lending operations to include additional manufactured housing loan products 
fundamental to the profitability and funding of the company s lending operations is the sale of loans with servicing rights retained 
the majority of the company s revenue is derived from the gain recognized on the sale of loans and the recognition of net loan fees at the time of sale of the loans 
net loan fees on loans owned by the company are recognized over the lives of the loans as an adjustment to yield using the interest method 
the company sells substantially all of its loan production in public securitization transactions through shelf registration statements of its subsidiaries 
during  and  the company sold publicly billion  billion and million  respectively  of pass through certificates backed by its home equity loans and  during  million of pass through certificates backed by its manufactured housing contracts 
the company s lending operations are interest rate sensitive and  therefore  fluctuations in and the level of interest rates can have a variety of effects on the company s profitability 
in particular  significant changes in interest rates may impact the volume of loans produced  and will influence the funding costs of such production and the amount of gain recognized on loans sold in the secondary market 
during periods of declining interest rates the lending operations will generally experience an increase in profitability as the interest spread should widen both on loans held by the company as an investment and on loans sold in the secondary market 
the weighted average interest spread on home equity loans sold to third parties the difference between the stated rate on the loan and the rate paid to purchasers  less recurring fees was  and in  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest spread on loans sold is determined without regard to credit losses  which are provided for separately by the company 
although historically a lower interest rate environment has not resulted in a significant increase in the level of prepayment of loans originated and serviced by the company  a significant and sustained reduction in interest rates could cause prepayments to increase  and thereby result in a contraction of the amount of loans owned and serviced and an accelerated amortization of capitalized excess servicing income 
increased prepayments reduce the time period during which the company receives excess servicing income and other servicing income with respect to prepaid loans 
increased amortization of capitalized excess servicing income is a current charge to earnings 
likewise  if delinquencies or liquidations were to occur sooner in the portfolio of loans sold by the company and or with greater frequency than was initially assumed  capitalized excess servicing income amortization would occur more quickly than originally anticipated  which would have an adverse effect on servicing income in the period of such adjustment 
in contrast  an increase in the level of interest rates for an extended period of time could adversely affect the ability of the company to originate loans  as well as the profitability of the loan origination program  by increasing the cost of funding and reducing the interest spread on loans retained and loans sold 
if actual prepayments with respect to loans sold occur more slowly than estimated at the time of sale  total income would exceed previously estimated amounts  however  no adjustments would be made to capitalized excess servicing income on the company s consolidated balance sheet as such income would be recognized prospectively 
for further discussion of loan sale gains and capitalized excess servicing income see note to notes to the consolidated financial statements

    fluctuations in and the level of market interest rates will impact the interest spread retained by the company on loans sold which includes for purposes hereof manufactured housing contracts and  potentially  the amount of its loan sale gains 
an increase in the level of market interest rates will generally adversely affect the interest spread on loans sold  whereas such interest spread generally widens during a declining interest rate environment 
the effect of actions which may be taken by the company during a rising interest rate environment to mitigate the impact on earnings of fluctuations in market rates  such as increasing the coupon rate charged on its loan products  will generally lag the impact of market rate fluctuations 
in connection with loan securitization transactions  the company has used a prefunding feature which locks in the pass through rate that the company will pay to the investor on a predetermined amount of loans for future delivery

   the increase in personnel costs are primarily associated with the expansion of the company s lending operations 
approximately of the increase in personnel costs in compared to is related to the startup of the company s manufactured housing lending operations 
the remaining increase is primarily related to expansion of the company s other lending distribution networks and incentive compensation related to an increase in home equity loan production 
the company s loan sale agreements generally provide for the subordination of cash and excess interest spread relating to the loans sold 
such subordination relates to credit losses which may occur after the sale of the loans and continues until the earlier of the payment in full of the loans or the termination of the agreement pursuant to which the loans were sold 
regardless of the structure of the loan sale transaction  the company estimates the amount of future losses under the loan sale agreements and provides a reserve for such loss by reducing the amount of loan sale gain recognized 
for estimated losses on the company s owned portfolio  the company establishes an allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings 
the increase in the loan loss provision is primarily related to an increase in the amount of charge offs in the portfolio of home equity loans owned and or serviced 
during  and  the company charged off million  million and million in home equity loans  respectively

asset quality and reserves the quality of the loans owned and those serviced for third parties significantly affects the profitability of the company 
the values of and markets for these assets are dependent on a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates and governmental regulations 
adverse changes in such factors  which become more pronounced in periods of economic decline  may affect the quality of these assets and the company s resulting ability to sell these assets for acceptable prices 
general economic deterioration can result in increased delinquencies on existing loans and reductions in collateral values 
substantially all of the home equity loans and manufactured housing contracts produced by the company are sold in securitization transactions in which securities backed by these loans and contracts pass through certificates are publicly offered and sold  with servicing rights retained 
the purchasers of the pass through certificates receive a credit enhanced security which is provided in part in home equity loan securitizations through a guaranty provided by a third party insurer or  in connection with the initial manufactured housing contract securitization  through a senior subordinated structure 
credit enhancement for the pass through certificates is also provided by subordinating a cash deposit and the excess interest spread retained by the company to the payment of scheduled principal and interest on the certificates 
the subordination of the cash deposit and the excess interest spread retained by the company relates to credit losses which may occur after the sale of the loans and contracts and generally continues until the earlier of the payment in full of the loans or termination of the agreement pursuant to which the loans and contracts were sold 
if cumulative payment defaults exceed the amount subordinated  a third party insurer  except in the initial manufactured housing securitization  is obligated to pay any further losses experienced by the owners of the pass through certificates 
such losses are borne first by the subordinated pass through certificates in the company s initial manufactured housing contract securitization 
the company is also obligated to cure  repurchase or replace loans and contracts which may be determined after the sale to violate representations and warranties relating to them and which are made by the company at the time of the sale 
the company regularly evaluates the quality of the loan portfolio and estimates its risk of loss based upon historical loss experience  prevailing economic conditions  estimated collateral value and such other factors which  in management s judgment  are relevant in estimating the credit risk in owned and or serviced loans 
for loans and contracts sold  the company records a provision for the estimated amount of credit losses at the time of sale  and records such amount on its balance sheet in the allowance for loan losses 
estimated losses on the owned portfolio are also provided for by an increase in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to current operating income 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million 
the maximum recourse associated with sales of home equity loans and manufactured housing contracts according to terms of the sale agreements totaled approximately million at december   of which amount approximately million relates to the subordinated cash and excess interest spread 
should credit losses on loans and contracts sold materially exceed the company s estimates for such losses  such consequence will have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
at december   the contractual balance of home equity loans serviced was approximately billion  substantially all of which are owned by and serviced for third party investors 
the portfolio is geographically diversified 
although the company services loans in states  at december  a substantial portion of the home equity loans serviced were originated in california  ohio  louisiana and florida  respectively  and no other state accounted for more than of the serviced portfolio 
in addition  at december   the company serviced approximately million of manufactured housing contracts  of which were originated in texas  in south carolina and of which were originated in each of the states of georgia and north carolina

 the above delinquency  default and loan loss experience represents the company s recent experience 
however  the delinquency  default and net loss percentages may be affected by the increase in the size and relative lack of seasoning of a substantial portion of the portfolio 
in addition  the company can neither quantify the impact of property value declines  if any  on the home equity loans and manufactured housing contracts nor predict whether or to what extent or how long such declines may exist 
in a period of such declines  the rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses on the home equity loans and manufactured housing contracts could be higher than those theretofore experienced in the residential mortgage lending industry in general 
adverse economic conditions which may or may not affect real property values may affect the timely payment by borrowers of scheduled payments of principal and interest on the home equity loans and manufactured housing contracts and  accordingly  the actual rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses 
as a result  the information in the above tables should not be considered as the only basis for assessing the likelihood  amount or severity of delinquencies  defaults or losses in the future and no assurance can be given that the delinquency  default and loss experience presented in the tables will be indicative of such experience

in connection with the sale transactions in the secondary market  third party surety bonds except in the case of the initial manufactured housing contract securitization and cash deposits by the company as credit enhancements have been provided 
the loan sale transactions have required the subordination of certain cash flows payable to the company to the payment of principal and interest due to certificate holders 
in connection with these transactions  the company has been required  in some instances  to fund an initial deposit  and thereafter  in each transaction  a portion of the amounts receivable by the company from the excess interest spread has been required to be placed and maintained in a reserve account to the extent of the subordination requirements 
the subordination requirements generally provide that the excess interest spread is payable to a reserve account until a specified level of cash  which is less than the maximum subordination amount  is accumulated therein 
the capitalized excess servicing income of the company is subject to being utilized first to replenish cash paid from the reserve account to fund shortfalls in collections from borrowers who default on the payment of principal or interest on the loans and contracts underlying the pass through certificates issued until the total of the company s deposits into the reserve account equal the maximum subordination amount 
after the company s deposits into the reserve account equal the maximum subordination amount for a transaction  the subordination of the related excess interest spread including the guarantee fee payable therefrom for these purposes is terminated 
the excess interest spread required to be deposited and maintained in the respective reserve accounts will not be available to support the cash flow requirements of the company until such amount exceeds the maximum subordinated amount other than amounts  if any  in excess of the specified levels required to be maintained in the reserve accounts  which may be distributed periodically to the company 
at december   the amounts on deposit in such reserve accounts totaled million
