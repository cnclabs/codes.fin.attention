comparison of results of operations in   and historically  the company has not had revenues  and had none in   and instead  it receives operating funds from income sources other than revenue  such as the option and sale of property and royalty interests  the sale of equity securities  and interest on investments 
the income from these sources fluctuates irregularly from year to year  causing a significant impact on operating results 
during   and the company did not receive any income from advance mineral royalties  reimbursements related to venture properties  or from the sale of properties 
consequently  there was no corresponding cost of mineral properties sold 
however  the company was successful in   and in obtaining additional equity investments and in acquiring various mineral properties 
therefore  management of the company believes the nature and level of general and administrative expenditures is appropriate  given the lack of operating revenue 
in summary  the company s total operating costs decreased percent in million as compared to million  primarily because of cutbacks in personnel and other overhead costs  after increasing by percent from million to the decrease in operating costs  however  was offset by an equal decrease in non revenue income from the increase in operating costs over  on the other hand  was more than offset by the added income from securities sales and absence of losses from investments that were experienced in these changes resulted in a net loss for the company of million in each of per share and per share  compared with a net loss of million in per share 
general and administrative expenses decreased from  in  to  in the decrease is primarily the result of reductions in personnel and payroll expense  which had increased from to accounting fees decreased from  in to  in  which was a significant decrease from 
these decreases resulted from continued reductions in the number and value of common shares issued to accounting personnel for services  the reduction of personnel in the accounting department  and in the fees paid to the company s independent public accountants 
also  fees paid to consultants for technical  promotional and administrative work decreased from  in to  in  which also was a significant decrease from 
these decreases resulted from continued reductions in the number of consultants engaged by the company 
office leasing costs have increased from  and  to  due to the expansion of field offices and the increasing need for additional office space for technical and support services 
in an effort to preserve cash  the company has traditionally paid some of its expenses by issuing shares of common stock 
the company paid directors fees in  and by issuing shares of common stock and accounting for accruals of unissued shares 
the value of the shares issued and accrued  however  varies from year to year because their valuation is determined directly by the market price on the issuance date 
also  was the final year in which the value of share issuances by royal silver to its directors was added to the company s general and administrative expense due to the non consolidation of royal silver s accounts following its reorganization in with a non related company 
the difference in interest and other income from  to  was due to a one time option to purchase stock that occurred in on the other hand  interest and other income greatly increased from  to  primarily because of receipts from joint venture payments  increases in management consulting fees paid to the company  and from the sale of an option regarding the company s royal silver stock holdings 
during and  the company did not incur any loss from dilution of equity investment in any of its subsidiaries  in contrast to  in which the company experienced a loss of  on its investments accounted for under the equity method  due to the reduction in its ownership in royal silver to percent brought about as a result of its reorganization with a non related company 
in fiscal and  the company recognized a gain from the sale of securities it held in royal silver common stock 
in  the company did not sell any of its securities and there was no such gain 
in and  unlike  the company experienced a loss from the disposition of assets 
the loss resulted from the abandonment of a leasehold interest  and the loss resulted from the abandonment of property held by a subsidiary of the company

the amount of cash used by the company s operations decreased from  in  to  in  by focusing resources and reducing overhead costs

the company expended  in  and  in  to acquire property and equipment 
the company s long term debt is partially related to the lease of equipment that was acquired during fiscal the other multi year obligations of the company are note payments on mining claims the company has purchased  and payments on mining claim leases that are cancelable at the company s option 
moreover  if the company is not successful in raising additional equity capital  selling some of its equipment  land  or equity securities  or negotiating beneficial joint venture business arrangements  the company will reduce the level of expenditures by releasing some properties  thereby eliminating their associated costs to match the company s cash flow position
