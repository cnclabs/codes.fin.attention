phoenix markets its products and services primarily through a direct sales force  but also through regional distributors and sales representatives 
phoenix promotes its products through company newsletters and technical bulletins  coverage in trade and business press articles  advertising  and participation in industry trade shows and conferences 
rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products incorporating new technologies characterize the personal computer industry 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies often results in the emergence of new industry standards  rendering existing products obsolete 
to remain competitive  manufacturers must respond quickly to such technological changes 
this rapid pace of change can benefit phoenix as it provides a continuous flow of opportunities for the company to provide high value technology and support to its customers 
however  if the company or its customers are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop products in a timely manner in response to changes in the pc or information appliance industries  the company s business would be materially and adversely affected 
the company develops  and licenses and or purchases from others  software products to market to oems 
due to rapid technological changes  the company expects to continue to dedicate significant resources to the development and acquisition of new products and enhancements to existing products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will be successful or  even if they are successful  that any resulting products will achieve market acceptance

in fiscal and  one customer accounted for and  respectively  of total revenue 
no customer accounted for or more of revenue in fiscal in fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenue was attributable to customers outside the united states 
in fiscal  intel corporation began shipping products containing phoenix system software under a seven year agreement the technology agreement signed in december under the technology agreement  phoenix licensed certain of its system level software to intel for incorporation into intel s motherboard products for desktop and server computers 
the technology agreement requires phoenix to provide intel with a dedicated engineering team to support intel under the agreement and develop agreed upon enhancements to the licensed software 
in addition  phoenix is assisting intel in its transition to phoenix s system level software  the transition is expected to be completed in fiscal in consideration of the license grants and other commitments made by phoenix  the agreement requires intel to pay phoenix minimum annual fees and royalties 
these minimum amounts can be exceeded depending on levels of shipment by intel of intel products containing the licensed software 
the maximum license fees payable by intel to phoenix under the technology agreement during its seven year term is million  however  there can be no assurances that intel will ship the volume of products required to entitle phoenix to such maximum fees 
concurrently with the signing of the technology agreement  phoenix and intel entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement the equity agreement whereby intel agreed to purchase  shares of phoenix common stock  together with a warrant to purchase an additional  shares 
the closing of the sale of the stock and the warrant occurred on february  description of business the company is divided into two related product divisions the pc systems division pcsd and the special products division spd

the company s products support the latest processors  chip sets  system busses  and interconnect technologies  such as acpi 
the introduction of new hardware architectures  microprocessors  peripheral equipment and operating systems within the pc industry has increased the complexity  time  and cost to develop system software products 
the company believes that oem customers license the company s system software products  rather than develop these products internally  in order to assure compatibility with industry standards  release products to market faster  reduce product development risks  reduce product development and support costs  and differentiate their system offerings with advanced features 
price competition and time to market pressures are causing manufacturers to re examine in house development and deployment of their new systems 
the company believes there is an increasing trend of oems to outsource system software requirements to third parties 
the demand for the company s pc system software products depends principally on pc manufacturers licensing rather than developing their own pc system software  the sales success of the company s oem customers  the emergence of new pc technologies requiring system level software to achieve increased system functionality  user value  and performance  and the functions and features offered in the company s products compared to those of its competitors 
the growth rate of sales in the personal computer industry fluctuates from time to time based on numerous factors  including general economic conditions  capital spending levels  new product introductions and shortages of key components 
phoenixbios phoenix introduced phoenixbios as its core desktop systems firmware product in since then  the company has continuously released improvements to the core product

leadership in major industry initiatives phoenix has entered into a number of major initiatives with industry leaders and standards setting organizations to develop next generation  system software products 
these initiatives include working with microsoft  intel and toshiba on the acpi specification  developing the device bay specification with compaq and microsoft  developing the desktop management interface dmi  on now specification and the simple boot quick boot specification with microsoft  and working on or with several ieee committees on and usb interconnect standards 
phoenix s relationships with compaq  intel  microsoft  and other industry leaders give the company early access to new technology requirements  which the company believes facilitates the development of its products 
by building upon its core technology base  the company is able to tailor its system software products to conform to the specific requirements of its oem customers  allowing its customers to integrate new technologies and introduce their products to market more effectively 
competition in marketing its bios  notebios  pico and isg products  phoenix competes primarily with three other independent suppliers of bios technology american megatrends  inc  award software international inc 
and systemsoft corporation 
it also competes for system software business with in house research and development departments of pc manufacturers that have significantly greater financial and technical resources than those of phoenix 
these companies include acer incorporated  compaq computer corporation  dell computer corporation  international business machines corporation and toshiba corporation 
in the virtual chips synthesizable core business  phoenix competes with major eda suppliers such as mentor graphics and synopsys who are attempting to broaden their design tool business to include synthesizable cores  and small design houses  such as sand microelectronics  inc  who provide synthesizable cores  often as part of a design consulting contract 
the bases for competition for the pc system software are primarily product performance and availability  engineering experience and expertise  product support and price 
phoenix believes it competes favorably on these bases

employees as of september   the company employed persons worldwide  of whom are in research and development  are in sales and marketing  and are in general and administration 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights the company relies primarily on trade secret  trademark and copyright laws and contractual agreements to protect its proprietary rights 
the company protects the source code of its products as trade secrets and as unpublished copyrighted works 
the company licenses the source code for its products to its customers for limited uses 
the company licenses its software products to its customers 
wide dissemination of the company s software products makes protection of the company s proprietary rights difficult  particularly outside the united states 
although it is possible for competitors or users to make illegal copies of the company s products  the company believes the rate of technology change and the continual addition of new product features lessen the impact of illegal copying 
at september   the company had been issued three patents and had patent applications in process 
although the company believes that its products do not infringe on any copyright or other proprietary rights of third parties  there are currently significant legal uncertainties relating to the application of copyright and patent law in the field of software 
the company has no assurance that third parties will not obtain  or do not have  patents covering features of the company s products  in which event the company or its customers might be required to obtain licenses to use such features 
if a patent holder refuses to grant a license on reasonable terms or at all  the company may be required to alter certain products or stop marketing them 
in recent years  there has been a marked increase in the number of patents applied for and issued with respect to software products

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company s primary business is to provide system software and engineering services to oems and integrators of pcs and information appliances special purpose computers 
in august  the company acquired virtual chips  inc virtual chips in exchange for  shares of newly issued common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and financial information for the quarters in fiscal has been restated to reflect virtual chips results of operations 
the financial statements for fiscal have not been restated as the results of operations of virutal chips were not material in relation to those of the company 
shares used in the computation of net income per share have been restated for all periods presented to give effect to the shares issued and options assumed by the company in the transaction 
virtual chips is a leading supplier of synthesizable cores for the computer industry 
synthesizable cores are pre packaged circuit descriptions used as building blocks for system level application specific integrated circuits asics 
asics are used in computers and peripheral devices to connect them using pci  usb and other emerging industry standard protocols 
revenue revenue increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue increased million in fiscal from million in fiscal license revenue increased from fiscal to  and from fiscal to the increase resulted primarily from an increase in royalty revenue from the company s expanding customer base  additional sales to existing customers  as well as increased revenue associated with the growth of the special products business 
growth in the company s revenues for the year was obscured by the effect of product transitions  the largest of which was the phase out of a consumer application product late in fiscal during fiscal  unit growth was greater than revenue growth as the average royalty per desktop unit declined by approximately 
in fiscal  the consumer application product generated million of revenue  compared to million in fiscal service revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal  and from fiscal to the increases in service revenue are generally consistent with the growth in unit volumes 
in addition  the life cycle of designs has generally shortened  resulting in more design and company services for a given volume of units 
revenue in fiscal increased over fiscal in all regions 
in fiscal and  one customer accounted for and of revenues  respectively 
no customers accounted for or more of revenue in fiscal gross margin gross margin as a percent of revenue was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
license fee gross margin was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in license fee gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was a result of lower third party royalties from the phase out of a consumer application product  offset by an increase in the amortization of capitalized computer software costs 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to increases in royalty expense and amortization of capitalized computer software costs 
service gross margin was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal results principally from a reorganization of us engineering effective april st 
development and field engineering were separated to facilitate improved focus in each group 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal in service gross margin is attributable to productivity improvements in service engineering 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in the company s engineering staff to continue development of system level software and the creation of a new product line to develop and market software to connect computers and peripheral devices 
for the past year  the company s investment in research and development also has trended higher in order to implement the intel alliance and to expand the company s products beyond the pc motherboard 
the increase as a percent of revenue from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to the creation of a new product line to develop and market software to connect computers and peripheral devices and the acquisition of virtual chips  inc the company capitalized approximately million  million and million of internally developed software costs in fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts were offset by amortization of capitalized software costs of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that continued investment in new and evolving technologies is essential to meet rapidly changing industry requirements 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in fiscal and fiscal are primarily due to growth in sales and marketing headcount associated with higher revenues 
the decrease as a percent of revenue in fiscal resulted primarily from the discontinuance of advertising expenses related to products marketed through the retail channel 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in fiscal and are primarily from increases in salaries and related benefits associated with continued headcount growth 
fiscal also includes non recurring charges related to the consolidation of facilities in northern and southern california 
costs of acquisition costs of acquisition of million in fiscal include the costs associated with the acquisition of virtual chips  inc in fiscal interest income  net net interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income over the years is primarily due to the increase in the average cash balances available for investment in the respective periods 
other income  net on september   phoenix exercised its right to require softbank corporation of japan to repurchase the softbank content group shares owned by the company for million and recorded a gain on investment of million 
during fiscal  the company sold  shares of common stock of xionics document technologies  inc xionics and recorded a gain on investment of million 
discontinued operations in september  the company sold  shares of common stock of xionics in its initial public offering 
in addition  the company received payment on a promissory note 
the gain on the repayment of the note and sale of the stock in the amount of million was recorded as a gain from discontinued operations  net of income taxes of million  to the extent such amounts were previously written off in previous fiscal years by a charge to discontinued operations 
the remaining amount of  in fiscal year  which represents investment gains  was recorded in continuing operations as other income on the company s income statement

provision for income taxes the company recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit from losses in the prior years  partially offset by the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit 
the company s effective tax rate has been lower than the statutory rate primarily due to various federal and state tax credits and tax benefit of prior year losses 
the provisions for fiscal and include income tax benefits in the fourth quarters of million and million resulting from a reduction in the company s valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires recognition of deferred tax assets when the probability of recovery is more likely than not 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  earnings per share  which is required to be adopted by the company on september  with quarterly disclosure 
at that time  the company will be required to change the method currently used to compute earnings per share and to restate all prior periods 
under the new requirements  primary and fully diluted earnings per share will be replaced with basic and diluted earnings per share 
if sfas had been effective for fiscal and  it would have resulted in a basic net income per share of and and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  and financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which will be required to be adopted by the company in fiscal in october  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which will be required to be adopted by the company on september  adoption of these statements is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fluctuations in operating results the tables in part ii  item of this form k include selected unaudited quarterly consolidated results of operations for fiscal and this information was derived from the company s unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present this information  when read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
phoenix s future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of its license fees are subject to a number of factors that make estimating revenues and operating results prior to the end of a quarter uncertain 
while phoenix receives recurring revenue on royalty based license agreements and some agreements contain minimum quarterly royalty commitments  a significant amount of license fees in any quarter is dependent on signing agreements and delivering the licensed software in that quarter 
generally  phoenix has experienced a pattern of recording or more of its quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter 
phoenix has historically monitored its revenue bookings through regular  periodic worldwide forecast reviews during the quarter 
however  while these reviews keep management informed of areas where additional selling effort may be needed in order to meet the internal plans and market expectations  there can be no assurances that this process will result in revenue expectations being met 
operating expenses for any year are normally based on the attainment of planned revenue levels for that year and are incurred ratably throughout the period 
as a result  if revenues are less than planned in any period while expense levels remain relatively fixed  phoenix s operating results would be adversely affected for that period 
in addition  the incurring of unplanned expenses could adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses were incurred 
business risks the additional following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating phoenix and its business 
product development phoenix s long term success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis that meet the needs of its current customers in their present markets and of current and future customers in new and emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that phoenix will be successful in developing new products or in enhancing existing products or that new or enhanced products will meet market requirements 
delays in introducing new products can adversely impact acceptance and revenue generated from the sale of such products 
phoenix has  from time to time  experienced such delays 
phoenix s software products and their enhancements contain complex code which may contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced  despite testing 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will not contain errors or bugs that will adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products or enhancements 
protection of intellectual property phoenix relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its software products 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to phoenix s technology 
in addition  copyright and trade secret protection for phoenix s products may be unavailable or unreliable in certain foreign countries 
the company has been issued patents with respect to its current product offerings and has a number of patent applications pending with respect to certain of the products it markets 
phoenix maintains an active internal program designed to identify internally developed inventions worthy of being patented 
there can be no assurance that any of the applications pending will be approved and patents issued or that phoenix s engineers will be able to develop technologies capable of being patented 
as the number of software patents increases  phoenix believes that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that its patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by phoenix 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could have an adverse effect on phoenix s business  results of operations and financial condition 
infringement of valid patents or copyrights or misappropriation of valid trade secrets could also have an adverse effect on phoenix s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  such claims if alleged against certain phoenix customers  may give rise to indemnity or other obligations on the part of phoenix 
dependence on third party providers of technology phoenix s products use certain products and technologies of various third party software developers  including both complete products offered as extensions of phoenix s product lines and technology used in the enhancement of internally developed products 
these products are licensed under contractual agreements  which in some cases are for limited time periods and in some cases provide for termination under certain circumstances 
there can be no assurance that the technology plans and directions for the third party products will remain compatible with phoenix s needs  that these third party providers will commit adequate development resources to maintain or enhance these products and technologies  or that the license agreements with limited duration will be renewed upon expiration 
in such circumstances  phoenix may not be able to obtain or develop substitute products or technology  which could adversely affect phoenix s business  results of operation and financial condition 
importance of microsoft and intel for a number of years  phoenix has worked closely with microsoft corporation and intel corporation in developing standards for the pc industry 
in addition  phoenix supplies its system level software technology to intel 
phoenix remains optimistic regarding its relationships with these two industry leaders 
there can  however  be no assurance that either microsoft or intel will not develop alternative product strategies which could conflict with phoenix s product plans and marketing strategies and  accordingly  adversely impact phoenix s business and results of operations 
presently  there is little overlap or conflict in phoenix s product offerings and strategies and those of intel 
windows nt and windows ce  microsoft s newer operating systems  incorporate some functionality that has traditionally resided in the bios 
both intel and microsoft  in their endeavors to add value  incorporate features or functions provided by phoenix in silicon or the operating system  respectively 
therefore  phoenix must continually create new features and functions to sustain as well as increase its added value to oems 
there can be no assurances that phoenix will be successful in these efforts 
attraction and retention of key personnel phoenix believes it employs more bios engineers than any other company in the pc industry 
virtual chips products are based on new and emerging technologies which are different from bios technologies 
phoenix s ability to achieve its revenue and operating performance objectives will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain technically qualified engineers 
the available pool of engineering talent is limited for both operations 
accordingly  failure to attract  retain and grow its research and development teams could adversely affect phoenix s business and operating results 
dependence on key customers  concentration of credit risk the loss of any key customer and the inability of the company to replace revenues provided by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
the company s customer base consists principally of large oems in the pc market and as a result  the company maintains individually significant receivable balances from major oems 
if these oems fail to meet their guaranteed minimum royalty payments and other payment obligations  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
as of september   the three largest receivable balances collectively represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
competition the market for phoenix s products is very competitive 
phoenix competes primarily with three other independent suppliers with respect to its system level software products award software international inc  systemsoft corporation and american megatrends  inc it also competes for bios business with in house research and development departments of pc manufacturers that have significantly greater financial and technical resources than those of phoenix 
these companies include acer inc  compaq computer  dell computer  international business machines and toshiba 
in the synthesizable core business  phoenix competes with businesses such as mentor graphics corporation  synposys corporation and cadence systems who have resources far greater than those of phoenix and with other companies such as sand microelectronics  inc there can be no assurance that phoenix will continue to compete successfully with its current competitors or that it will be able to compete successfully with new competitors 
international sales and activities revenue derived from phoenix s international operations comprises a majority of total revenues 
there can be no assurances that phoenix will not experience significant fluctuations in international revenues 
while the major portion of phoenix s license fee or royalty contracts are us dollar denominated  phoenix is entering into an increasing number of contracts denominated in local currencies 
phoenix has sales and engineering offices in england  france  germany  japan  korea and taiwan and uses software engineering firms in israel and india 
phoenix s operations and financial results could be adversely affected by factors associated with international operations such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances  political instability in emerging markets  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  as well as by other risks associated with international activities 
volatile market for phoenix stock the market for phoenix s stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of phoenix common stock has been  and will continue to be  subject to fluctuations in response to operating and financial results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or customer contracts by phoenix and its competitors  changes in phoenix s or its competitors product mix or product direction  changes in phoenix s revenue mix and revenue growth rates  changes in expectations of growth for the pc industry  as well as other events or factors which phoenix may not be able to influence or control 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the market in which phoenix does business  companies with which phoenix competes or relating to phoenix specifically could have an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of phoenix s stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies
