the company s revenues are derived primarily from two sources software licenses and fees for services  including support contracts and training and consulting services 
the company has experienced a significant shift in the sources of its revenues as a result of its decision to concentrate its resources on the development and marketing of enterprise wide asset maintenance management systems operating in a client server environment 
the company released maximo  its first client server product  in  and released p x  its second client server product  in in the fiscal year ended september   revenues from client server software accounted for of software revenues  of which was attributable to the client server versions of maximo 
the company acquired maintenance automation corporation mac on march  mac is a developer of maintenance management software for the single user  pc lan segment 
in march  the company released a new sql server version of maximo enterprise and maximo workgroup for the microsoft sql server database 
the new sql server version is available for windows nt servers  including nt and nt  supporting windows  windows b  all windows x systems  and nt and nt clients 
in august  the company released maximo analyzer  a new business intelligence tool

in september  the company released the maximo mobile application suite  a mobile and paperless work management system 
maximo mobile application suite is a set of new integrated maximo modules which install directly onto hand held computers and utilize bar coding technology to ensure compliance with procedures and automation of routine and preventive practices for maintenance engineers 
in fiscal  the company introduced a new suite of maximo products maximo enterprise  maximo workgroup and maximo advantage 
maximo enterprise  a new version of which was released in march  is a client server product  which runs on oracle and sybase platforms and is intended for the high function  high usage segment of the maintenance management market 
maximo workgroup  released in july  is also a client server product and runs on sqlbase and oracle workgroup and is intended for the mid range segment of the maintenance management market 
the product acquired as a result of the acquisition of mac on march   maximo advantage  is intended for the lowerend maintenance market 
maximo advantage supports microsoft access for the single user  pc lan segment 
the company incurred significant additional and unexpected costs in developing a new release of maximo advantage due to a delay in excess of six months in completing the new release of this product 
the delay was necessary to meet both the quality expectations and functionality demanded by the company 
further affecting maximo advantage sales was the delay in availability of a cd rom based multi media evaluation kit 
this evaluation kit generally became available in december in march  the company released the first significant version of maximo advantage since the acquisition of maintenance automation corporation 
the company has not realized any significant revenues from this new release despite opening a new tele sales operation in atlanta in march accordingly  expenses related to this product have been reduced to a level commensurate with the lower revenue expectations 
the unexpected costs and shortfalls in expected revenues resulted in net operating losses of  and  for mac for fiscal and  respectively 
the sources of the company s revenues from support and services have also shifted since the introduction of the company s new generation of client server products 
revenues from support and services relating to the company s maximo products have increased  while those relating to the company s p x and mainframe and other project management software have declined 
the company experienced an increase in the average selling price of its maximo client server software licenses during fiscal the company attributes this increase in part to licenses of a version of maximo for use with the oracle and sybase database management systems 
these client server versions of maximo have a higher entry price and are typically implemented in configurations involving a larger number of users  for whom additional license fees are paid 
larger software license contracts  if any  may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could therefore result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
revenues from licenses of p x have declined sharply  dropping to  of total license revenues in the fiscal year ended the company no longer actively markets the p x product as a stand alone solution 
revenues from licenses of mainframe and other project management software have also declined sharply  dropping to less than of total license revenues in the fiscal year ended the company no longer actively markets its mainframe and other project management software products  although it provides technical support and other services to their installed customer base 
the company s revenues attributable to its operations outside the united states are a significant portion of total revenues 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to be a significant percentage of total revenues 
as the percentage of the company s total revenues which are derived from international operations and are conducted in foreign currencies grows  changes in the values of these foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar will affect the company s results of operations  and may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
the functional currencies of the company s international subsidiaries include the pound sterling  the french franc  the german deutschemark  the thai baht  the dutch guilder  the indian rupee  the japanese yen  the swedish krona  and the australian and canadian dollars  each of which has fluctuated significantly in relation to the united states dollar 
in addition  the company is exposed to potential losses as a result of transactions giving rise to accounts receivable in currencies other than the united states dollar or the functional currencies of its international subsidiaries 
when the value of a foreign currency in which the accounts receivable of the company are denominated changes between the date the account receivable is recorded and the date on which it is settled  the resulting gain or loss is recorded as a foreign currency transaction adjustment 
the company recorded foreign currency transaction losses of   and  for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company may in the future undertake currency hedging  although there can be no assurance that hedging transactions  if entered into  would materially reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not adversely affect the company s financial results in the future

the company believes that its current cash balances combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least september  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  seasonality the company generally ships its product upon receipt of orders and maintains no significant backlog 
as a result  revenues from license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a delay in or loss of orders can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
in addition  the company s revenues and operating results have fluctuated historically  due to the number and timing of product introductions and enhancements  the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers and the timing of large orders  the timing of product shipments and the timing of marketing and product development expenditures 
large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could therefore result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues and income from operations typically grow at a lower rate or decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition  revenues are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters of the year  reflecting the company s fiscal year end and a sales commission policy that bases rewards on achievement of annual quotas 
as a result of these factors  the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
forward looking statements of the company are subject to the risk that assumptions made by management of the company concerning future general economic conditions such as recession  inflation  interest rates  tax rates  consumer spending and credit and other future condition having an impact on software markets and the company s business may prove to be incorrect
