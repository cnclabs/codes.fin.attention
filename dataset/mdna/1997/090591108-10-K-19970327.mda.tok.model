item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s financial statements  and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this document 
overview since its inception october   biofield has engaged in research and development associated with its cancer detection technology 
as a development stage company  the company has incurred net losses since inception through december  of approximately million 
the company expects operating losses to increase for at least the next several years as total costs and expenses increase due principally to increased marketing and manufacturing expenses associated with the anticipated commercialization of the alexa system  development of  and clinical trials for  the proposed biofield screening system and other research and development activities 
to date  the company has not marketed  or generated revenues from the commercialization of  any products 
the company s results may vary significantly from period to period depending on several factors  such as the timing of certain expenses and the progress of the company s research and development and commercialization programs  all of which may be affected by the availability of funds 
results of operations comparison of twelve months ended december  and research and development 
research and development expenses were  during  representing an increase of  from  during this increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in compensation and recruiting and relocation expenses due to an increase in research and development personnel from an average of full time equivalent employees in to an average of full time equivalent employees in  a  increase in consulting expenses related to third party reimbursement issues and preclinical research and a  increase due to clinical development activities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  during  representing an increase of  from  during this increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in compensation and recruiting and relocation expenses due to the hiring of a new president and chief executive officer in december  a new vice president of marketing and sales in june and a new director of marketing and sales in august  and increases in expenses incurred in connection with marketing activities  investor relations and additional premiums for directors and officers liability insurance 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during  as discussed above  was partially offset by a charge in of approximately  for severance benefits pursuant to an agreement between the company and its former president and a charge in of approximately  for a contractual settlement between the company and its vice chairman and former chief executive officer 
interest income 
the company s interest income was  during  representing an increase of  from  during this increase was primarily due to higher average invested cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances compared to those of the previous period 
comparison of twelve months ended december  and nine months ended december  the company changed its fiscal year end from march to december effective december  research and development 
research and development expenses during the twelve months ended december  were  representing an increase of  from  during the nine months ended december  on an annualized basis  the company s research and development expenses increased approximately  during the year ended december  from  during the annualized nine months ended december  this annualized increase was primarily due to increases in clinical development activities related to the us multi center study and european multi center study 
clinical development costs include payments to clinical investigators  contract research organization costs  patient recruitment fees and travel expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the twelve months ended december  were  representing an increase of  from  during the nine months ended december  on an annualized basis  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  during the year ended december  from  during the annualized nine months ended december  this annualized increase was primarily due to the charge of approximately  for severance benefits pursuant to an agreement between the company and its former president and a charge of approximately  for a contractual settlement between the company and its vice chairman and former chief executive officer 
interest income 
interest income during the twelve months ended december  was  representing an increase of  from  during the nine months ended december  on an annualized basis  the company s interest income increased approximately  during the year ended december  from  during the annualized nine months ended december  this annualized increase was primarily due to higher average invested cash balances compared to those of the previous period and  to a lesser extent  to higher interest rates on invested funds 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since inception primarily by the issuance of equity securities with aggregate net proceeds of approximately  and interest income of approximately  from investments 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement offering of common stock and approximately million in net proceeds from a private placement offering of series a convertible preferred stock  
par value per share  during fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
in september  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from a private placement offering of series b convertible preferred stock  
par value per share 
during the year ended december   the company received net proceeds of approximately million from a private placement offering of securities units including series c convertible preferred stock  
par value per share 
in march  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of the company s common stock in its initial public offering 
as of december   the company had total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  of which  was invested in investment grade corporate obligations  money market funds  shares of liquid auction market preferred stock and bonds  and certificates of deposit 
as of december   the company had working capital of  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital was the result of approximately million in net proceeds from the company s initial public offering offset by approximately million of cash used primarily to finance the company s operations and capital requirements 
the company does not expect to generate a positive internal cash flow for at least several years due to the expected increase in spending for research and development and the expected costs of commercializing the alexa system 
from the company s inception through december   the company purchased approximately million of property and equipment 
the company had no outstanding bank loans as of december  in july  the company obtained a commitment from an unrelated third party to finance up to million of capital equipment pursuant to sale leaseback agreement 
the company has not utilized such lease financing commitment to date 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the company has employment contracts with certain of its executives through the annual base compensation for these executives ranges from approximately  to  per year and provides for five percent annual cost of living adjustments 
aggregate minimum payments of annual base compensation under these contracts are  and  during and  respectively 
the company s other fixed commitments  including fees for current consultants  rent  payments under license agreements and other contractual commitments are substantial and are likely to increase as additional agreements are entered into and additional personnel are retained 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the company will require substantial additional funds for its research and development programs  preclinical and clinical testing  operating expenses  regulatory processes  and manufacturing and marketing programs 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the progress of its research and development projects  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes and developments in the company s existing collaborative  licensing and other relationships and the terms of any new collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that the company may establish  and the development of commercialization activities and arrangements 
the company believes that its available cash  cash equivalents and investment securities and investment income should be sufficient to fund the company s operations until the end of calendar year the company does not expect to generate a positive internal cash flow for at least several years due to expected increases in capital expenditures  working capital and ongoing losses  including the expected cost of commercializing the alexa system 
the company may need to arrange additional equity or debt financing for the future operation of its business 
there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained or  if it is obtained  that the terms thereof will be acceptable 
the company plans to continue its policy of investing excess funds in short term  investment grade corporate obligations  money market funds  shares of liquid auction market preferred stock and bonds  and certificates of deposit

uncertainty of pre market approval for the alexa system 
on december   the company submitted its pma to the fda for the alexa system 
on february   the fda informed the company that its pma had not been accepted for filing at this time and requested that the company address deficiencies in the pma for further consideration of such pma 
specifically  the fda has not accepted the findings from the company s us multi center study as submitted due to the fda s issues concerning the study design and  in particular  the development and selection of the algorithms used on the supporting data set 
the fda advised the company that it must select a final algorithm and then test it with an independent data set 
further  the fda stated that a clinical trial design that supports the indications for use of the alexa system should include the impact on patient management 
the company s pma for the alexa system is based principally upon the results of its us multi center study  which results have not been accepted by the fda based upon its initial review of the company s pma 
accordingly  it may be necessary for the company to submit additional data to the fda  which data may be based upon completed clinical studies and or additional clinical trials 
if the company is required to submit additional data to the fda or conduct additional clinical trials  there may be significant delays in the approval process for the alexa system 
conducting additional clinical trials could also require the expenditure of substantial additional funds  for which additional financing may be required 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that results obtained in any other studies that may be conducted by the company will be consistent with the results obtained in the us multi center study or that any such results will be accepted by the fda 
there can be no assurance that the fda or other regulatory approvals for the alexa system will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
failure to obtain fda approval to market the alexa system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
limited operating history  continuing operating losses 
the company has a limited history of operations 
since its inception in october  the company has engaged principally in the development of the alexa system  which has not been approved for sale in the united states 
consequently  the company has little experience in manufacturing  marketing and selling its products 
the company currently has no source of operating revenue and has incurred net operating losses since its inception 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  such losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and clinical trials and from general and administrative costs associated with the company s operations 
the company expects operating losses to increase for at least the next several years due principally to the anticipated expenses associated with the proposed commercialization of the alexa system  development of  and clinical trials for  the proposed biofield screening system and other research and development activities 
uncertainties as to future profitability 
the company s ability to achieve profitability will depend in part on its ability to obtain regulatory approvals for the alexa system and any other proposed products  and to develop the capacity to manufacture and market any approved products either by itself or in collaboration with others 
there can be no assurance if or when the company will receive required regulatory approvals for the development and commercial manufacturing and marketing of the alexa system or any other proposed products  or achieve profitability 
accordingly  the extent of future losses and the time required to achieve profitability are highly uncertain 
early stage of product development 
the company s proposed products  other than the alexa system  are at an early stage of development and the alexa system must be approved by the fda before it can be commercially marketed in the united states 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s proposed products will be found to be safe and effective  meet applicable regulatory standards or receive necessary regulatory clearance  or if safe and effective  can be developed into commercial products  manufactured on a large scale or be economical to market 
nor can there be any assurance that the company s proposed products will achieve or sustain market acceptance 
in the event necessary regulatory approvals are obtained for the alexa system  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in establishing commercial operations  including gaining market acceptance of the alexa system and implementing commercial scale manufacturing and sales and marketing programs 
there is  therefore  substantial risk that the company s product development and commercialization efforts will not prove to be successful 
dependence on a single product 
although the company is in the process of developing additional products based on its core technology  including an enhancement of the alexa system for use on asymptomatic women  none of such applications is expected to result in a commercial product for at least several years  if at all 
consequently  pending its approval for commercial distribution in the united states  the alexa system would account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
failure to gain regulatory approvals or market acceptance for the alexa system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
dependence on market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that physicians or the medical community in general will accept and utilize the alexa system or any other products developed by the company 
the extent that  and rate at which  the alexa system achieves market acceptance and penetration will depend on many variables including  but not limited to  the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of the alexa system  the advantages of the alexa system over existing technology and cancer detection methods including x ray mammography  ultrasound or high frequency ultrasound  mri  stereotactic needle biopsy and thermography  diaphonography and transillumational devices  third party reimbursement practices and the company s manufacturing  quality control  marketing and sales efforts 
there can be no assurance that the medical community and third party payors will accept the company s unique technology 
similar risks will confront the proposed biofield screening system and any other products developed by the company in the future 
failure of the company s products to gain market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
limited marketing and sales experience 
the company has limited internal marketing and sales resources and personnel 
in order to market the alexa system or any other products it may develop  the company will have to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish sales and distribution capabilities or that the company will be successful in gaining market acceptance for any products it may develop 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain skilled sales  marketing  service or support personnel  that agreements with distributors will be available on terms commercially reasonable to the company  or at all  or that the company s marketing and sales efforts will be successful 
failure to successfully establish a marketing and sales organization  whether directly or through third parties  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the company intends to pursue one or more distribution arrangements in the united states  europe and asia with strategic marketing partners who have established marketing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the company  either on its own or through arrangements with others  will be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that the company arranges with third parties to market its products  the success of such products may depend on the efforts of such third parties 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s proposed marketing schedules or plans can or will be met 
limited manufacturing history 
the company does not have any manufacturing or production facilities or experience in manufacturing or contracting for the manufacturing of its proposed products in the volumes that will be necessary for the company to achieve significant commercial sales in the event it obtains regulatory approval to market its products 
while the company does not currently manufacture any of its products  it may do so in the future 
the company has no experience in the manufacture of medical products for clinical trials or commercial purposes 
should the company manufacture its products  the company s manufacturing facilities would be subject to the full range of current gmp regulations and similar risks of delay or difficulty in manufacturing and the company would require substantial additional capital to establish such manufacturing facilities 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to manufacture any such products successfully or cost effectively 
dependence on third parties 
the company has used certain third parties to manufacture and deliver the components of the alexa system and the proposed biofield screening system used in clinical studies  and intends to continue to use third parties to manufacture and deliver such products and any other products which the company may seek to develop 
such third parties must adhere to the gmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program and such third parties facilities must pass a plant inspection before the fda will grant pre market approval of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the third party manufacturers on which the company depends for the manufacture of the alexa system will be in compliance with the gmp regulations at the time of the pre approval inspection or will maintain such compliance 
such failure could significantly delay fda approval of the pma application for the alexa system  and such delay would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the qualification of additional or replacement suppliers for certain components of the alexa system or services is a lengthy process 
for certain services and components the company currently relies on single suppliers 
if the company encounters delays or difficulties with its third party suppliers in producing  packaging or distributing components of the alexa system  market introduction and subsequent sales would be adversely affected 
the company also may have to rely on alternative sources of supply 
in such case  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
if the company is unable to obtain or retain qualified third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  it may not be able to commercialize its products as planned 
the company s dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of its products may adversely affect the company s profit margins and its ability to develop and deliver its products on a timely and competitive basis 
competition 
the medical device industry generally  and the cancer diagnostic and screening segments in particular  are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
other companies in the medical device industry are marketing products that compete with the alexa system and may be developing  or could in the future attempt to develop  additional products that are competitive with the alexa system 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater capital resources and name recognition than the company 
many of these companies also have substantially greater expertise than the company in research and development  manufacturing and marketing and obtaining regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than those developed or marketed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete against such competitors and potential competitors in terms of manufacturing  marketing and sales 
although the company believes that its products may offer certain technological advantages over its competitors currently marketed products  earlier entrants in the market for a diagnostic application often obtain and maintain significant market share relative to later entrants 
physicians using imaging equipment such as x ray mammography equipment  ultrasound or high frequency ultrasound systems  mri systems  stereotactic needle biopsy and thermography  diaphonography and transilluminational devices may not use the alexa system or any other products that the company may develop 
currently  mammography is employed widely and the company s ability to sell the alexa system to medical facilities will  in part  be dependent on the company s ability to demonstrate the clinical utility of the alexa system as an adjunct to mammography and physical examination and its advantages over other available diagnostic tests 
risk of technological obsolescence 
methods for the detection of cancer are subject to rapid technological innovation and there can be no assurance that technological changes will not render the company s proposed products obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the development of new types of diagnostic medical equipment or technology will not have a material adverse effect on the marketability of the alexa system or any other products developed by the company 
commercial availability of such products could render the company s products obsolete  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
potential reliance on international sales 
the company intends to commence commercial sales of the alexa system in europe prior to commencing commercial sales in the united states  where sales cannot occur unless and until the company receives pre market approval from the fda 
thus  until the company receives approval from the fda to market the alexa system  as to which there can be no assurance  the company s revenues  if any  will be derived from sales to international distributors 
a significant portion of the company s revenues  therefore  may be subject to the risks associated with international sales  including economic or political instability  shipping delays  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign regulatory requirements and various trade restrictions  all of which could have a significant impact on the company s ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
future imposition of  or significant increases in the level of  customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the regulation of medical devices  particularly in europe  continues to develop and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on the company 
government regulation  no assurance of regulatory approvals 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices  including the alexa system  the proposed biofield screening system  and any other products that may be developed by the company are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states  principally the fda and corresponding state agencies  and in other countries 
in the united states  the company s products are regulated as medical devices and are subject to the fda s pre market clearance or approval requirements 
securing fda clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the fda 
the results of the company s us multi center study have not been accepted by the fda based upon its initial review of the company s pma 
accordingly  it may be necessary for the company to submit additional data to the fda  which data may be based upon completed clinical studies and or additional clinical trials 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain and frequently requires from one to several years from the date of the fda submission  if pre market approval is obtained at all 
although the fda has granted expedited review status to the alexa  there can be no assurance that such status will result in timely approval of the alexa system  if at all 
failure to obtain fda approval to market the alexa system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
sales of medical devices outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval and the requirements may differ 
in addition  in order to sell its products within the european economic area following june   companies are required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the mdd and affix a ce marking on their products to attest such compliance 
the company has not obtained such certifications  and there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  unapproved products subject to the pma requirements must receive prior fda export approval in order to be marketed outside of the united states unless they are approved for use by any member country of the european union or certain other countries  including australia  canada  israel  japan  new zealand  switzerland and south africa  in which case they can be exported to any country provided that certain limited notification requirements are met 
there can be no assurance that the company will meet the fda s export requirements or receive fda export approval when such approval is necessary  or that countries to which the devices are to be exported will approve the devices for import 
failure of the company to meet the fda s export requirements or obtain fda export approval when required to do so  or to obtain approval for import  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed 
in addition  to obtain such approvals  the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities may impose numerous other requirements with which medical device manufacturers must comply 
fda enforcement policy strictly prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
product approvals could be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing 
the third party manufacturers upon which the company depends to manufacture its products are required to adhere to applicable fda regulations regarding gmps and similar regulations in other countries  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with gmp regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements will be monitored by periodic inspection by the fda and by comparable agencies in other countries 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  including marketing or promoting products for unapproved use  could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant pre market clearance or approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
changes in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
certain material changes to medical devices also are subject to fda review and clearance or approval 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain  on a timely basis  or at all  fda approval of its pma for the alexa system or regulatory approvals or clearances for other products that the company may develop and delays in receipt of or failure to obtain such approvals or clearances  the loss of previously obtained approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
limitation on third party reimbursement 
in the united states  suppliers of health care products and services are greatly affected by medicare  medicaid and other government insurance programs  as well as by private insurance reimbursement programs 
third party payors medicare  medicaid  private health insurance companies and other organizations may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of the company s products by regulating the level of reimbursement provided by such payors to the physicians and clinics utilizing the alexa system or any other products that the company may develop or by refusing reimbursement 
if examinations utilizing the company s products were not reimbursed under these programs  the company s ability to sell its products may be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that third party payors will provide reimbursement for use of the alexa system or any other products that the company may develop 
in international markets  reimbursement by private third party medical insurance providers  including governmental insurers and independent providers  varies from country to country 
in addition  such third party medical insurance providers may require additional information or clinical data prior to providing reimbursement for a product 
in certain countries  the company s ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third party and governmental reimbursement 
revenues and profitability of medical device companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
uncertainties regarding health care reform 
several states and the us government are investigating a variety of alternatives to reform the health care delivery system and further reduce and control health care spending 
these reform efforts include proposals to limit spending on health care items and services  limit coverage for new technology and limit or control the price health care providers and drug and device manufacturers may charge for their services and products  respectively 
if adopted and implemented  such reforms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
uncertain ability to protect patents and proprietary technology and information 
the company s ability to compete effectively in the medical products industry will depend on its success in protecting its proprietary technology  both in the united states and abroad 
the patent positions of medical products companies generally involve complex legal and factual questions 
the company s proprietary products and technology are covered by eight us patents owned by the company  and additional applications pending with the pto 
the company has filed  and intends to continue to file  patent applications in certain foreign jurisdictions covering the patent claims that are the subject of us patents and patent applications 
there can be no assurance that the pto or foreign jurisdictions will grant the company s pending patent applications or that the company will obtain any patents or other protection for which it has applied 
there can be no assurance that patents issued to or licensed by or to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide any competitive advantage 
the company could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting any patent rights  including those granted by third parties 
although the company has entered into confidentiality and invention agreements with its employees and consultants  there can be no assurance that such agreements will be honored or that the company will be able to protect its rights to its unpatented trade secrets and know how effectively 
moreover  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets and know how 
in addition  the company may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from third parties 
there can be no assurance that any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights would be made available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if the company does not obtain required licenses  it could encounter delays in product development or find that the development  manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be foreclosed 
additionally  the company may  from time to time  support and collaborate in research conducted by universities and governmental research organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will have or be able to acquire exclusive rights to the inventions or technical information derived from such collaborations or that disputes will not arise with respect to rights in derivative or related research programs conducted by the company or such collaborators 
uncertain ability to meet capital needs 
the company may require substantial additional funds for its research and development programs  preclinical and clinical testing  operating expenses  regulatory processes and manufacturing and marketing programs 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the progress of its research and development projects  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes and developments in the company s existing collaborative  licensing and other relationships and the terms of any new collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that the company may establish  and the development of commercialization activities and arrangements 
moreover  the company s fixed commitments  including salaries and fees for current employees and consultants  rent  payments under license agreements and other contractual commitments are substantial and are likely to increase as additional agreements are entered into and additional personnel are retained 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the company does not expect to generate a positive internal cash flow for at least several years due to expected increases in capital expenditures  working capital needs and ongoing losses  including the expected cost of commercializing the alexa system 
however  the company s cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to the progress of research and development programs  results of clinical testing  relationships with strategic partners  if any  changes in the focus and direction of the company s research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the fda and foreign regulatory processes and other factors 
the company may need additional capital to fund its future operations through public or private financings or collaborative licensing or other arrangements with corporate partners 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to existing stockholders will result and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional financing will be available when needed  or if available  will be available on acceptable terms 
insufficient funds may prevent the company from implementing its business strategy or may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of its research and product development programs or to license to third parties rights to commercialize products or technologies that the company would otherwise seek to develop itself 
dependence on qualified personnel 
due to the specialized scientific nature of the company s business  the company is highly dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner would be detrimental to the company s research and development programs and to its business 
the company s anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as marketing  will require the addition of new management personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
potential product liability 
the company s business exposes it to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of cancer detection products 
significant litigation  not involving the company  has occurred in the past based on allegations of false negative diagnoses of cancer 
while the alexa system does not purport to diagnose any patient  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subjected to future claims and potential liability 
while the company maintains insurance against product liability and defense costs  there can be no assurance that claims against the company arising with respect to its products will be successfully defended or that the insurance carried by the company will be sufficient to cover liabilities arising from such claims 
a successful claim against the company in excess of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms 
potential environmental liability 
a portion of the company s manufacturing processes involves the controlled use of potentially hazardous materials 
the company may in the future become subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of such materials 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant future costs to comply with environmental laws  rules  regulations and policies  or that the business  financial position  cash flows or results of operations of the company will not be materially and adversely affected by current or future environmental laws  rules  regulations and policies or by any releases or discharges of hazardous materials 
availability of preferred stock for issuance 
in addition to its authorized shares of common stock  the company s fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
the board of directors of the company may at any time determine to issue shares of preferred stock with the rights and preferences to be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion 
the rights and preferences of any such preferred stock may be superior to those of the common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock
