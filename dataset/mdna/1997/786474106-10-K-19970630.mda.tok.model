new accounting pronouncement in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share fas 
fas establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
it also requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
this statement is effective for the company beginning in the fiscal year ending march   earlier adoption is not permitted 
since the company is considered to have a simple capital structure for reporting eps  the adoption of this principle will have no material impact on reported eps 
seasonality and inflation the automotive operation s business is subject to the seasonal characteristics of the automotive industry in which there are seasonal plant shutdowns in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year 
although the systems contract is not seasonal in nature  there will be variations in revenues from the systems contract based upon costs incurred by the company in fulfilling the systems contract in each quarter 
the majority of the defense operation s ordnance manufacturing for us government and prime defense contractors occurs from january through september and there is generally a lower level of manufacturing and sales during the fourth calendar quarter 
the company does not believe that its operations to date have been materially affected by inflation
