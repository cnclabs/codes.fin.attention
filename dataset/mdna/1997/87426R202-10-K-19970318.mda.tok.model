item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
introduction the company was founded in as a switchless reseller of at t long distance services to small and medium sized businesses and currently has over  end users 
the company is currently in the process of completing the deployment of its own nationwide telecommunications network  obn consisting of five company owned  at t now lucent manufactured ess switches connected by at t transmission facilities 
as more fully described below  the company believes that gross margins for obn long distance service will be higher than those for at t long distance service 
the majority of the company s new orders are now being placed on obn which now has over  end users 
historically  the company has marketed the majority of its services through independent carriers and marketing companies known as partitions  which allowed the company to minimize overhead expenses 
the company expanded its business by adding partitions and providing existing and new partitions with operational  financing  marketing and management support 
beginning in  the company initiated and subsequently expanded through an acquisition in december  a direct marketing effort 
direct marketing requires the company to incur costs of marketing  including personnel  occupancy  marketing support and additional customer service costs which were historically borne by partitions 
currently  a large majority of the company s new sales are generated via direct marketing 
the company believes that gross margins for obn long distance service will be higher than those for at t long distance service 
at t long distance service is bundled  which means that the company pays a single  all inclusive price to at t for switching  transmission  and lec access 
obn long distance service is unbundled  which means that the company provides its own switching  pays at t for transmission  and pays access fees directly to lecs 
the unbundled charges per call on obn are expected to be less than the bundled charge paid to at t

year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales increased by to million in from million in the increase in sales related primarily to the continued expansion of the company s distribution network of partitions  as well as increases in the number of orders submitted by the company s existing partitions 
one partition  the furst group  inc accounted for approximately of the company s sales in versus zero in in addition  significant partition marketing efforts focused on inbound service resulted in sales of million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  although the company expects sales to increase through the company s direct marketing efforts  the aol agreement  the addition of new partitions  the growth of end user business through existing partitions and possible future acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to increase sales on a quarter to quarter or year to year basis 
cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales  consisting primarily of network usage charges for at t long distance services  increased by to million in from million in and is directly related to the increase in sales 
as a switchless reseller of at t long distance services and in order to provide its obn services  the company subscribes to contract tariffs 
the ability of the company to negotiate competitive terms of these tariffs has been an important reason for the company s success 
in october  the company subscribed to a new at t contract tariff  which was further revised in december and permits the company to continue to resell at t long distance services  including at t sdn service  through mid the new at t contract tariff also includes other at t services such as international long distance  inbound and outbound services that will be used in the company s nationwide telecommunications network  obn 
the rates that the company will pay under the new at t contract tariff are more favorable to the company than under previous tariffs 
during its term  the new at t contract tariff will enable the company to minimize possible attrition that might result from moving existing end users from the at t network to obn 
the new at t contact tariff also permits a more gradual introduction of obn  which should reduce the expense of providing the capacity required in a more rapid phase in of obn and lessen the impact of any technical difficulties during the phase in of obn 
the more gradual introduction of obn  however  will postpone the company s realization of the anticipated benefit of the more favorable margins for obn service  and the new at t contract tariff requires the company to commit to purchase million of service from a t over the next years  including at least million per month of international service 
this commitment is larger than any previous commitment that the company has made  but the company believes that it can be met based on its current purchases of long distance service from at t which are in excess of million per month 
further  the company can terminate the new contract tariff without liability to at t at the end of months if the company has generated at least million in usage charges  including at least million in international usage charges 
the company also may discontinue the new contract tariff without liability prior to the th month if the company and at t enter into a new contract tariff or another contract with a revenue commitment of at least million per month and a term of at least the difference between months and the number of months that the company subscribed to the contract tariff  provided that the company must purchase or pay for at t services under the contract tariff of at least million per month for the months prior to such termination  including million per month of international usage 
obn and the operation of the company s own switches and network will require the company to incur systems and equipment maintenance  lease  and network personnel expenses significantly above the levels historically experienced by the company as a switchless reseller of at t services 
however  these per call costs  in combination with unbundled charges paid to lecs and at t  are expected to be less than the per call cost currently incurred by the company as a switchless reseller paying bundled charges to at t 
in december  the company  in connection with the settlement of certain disagreements among the company  america business alliance  inc aba  an independent long distance and marketing company  and the shareholders of aba  acquired substantially all of the assets of aba 
operations of its own direct marketing will require the company to incur additional costs including personnel  occupancy  and marketing support  which may be significantly above levels historically experienced by the company 
there can be no assurance that any cost savings will be realized utilizing direct marketing when compared to the costs historically incurred by the company utilizing its partitions 
the aol agreement will initially require the company to provide competitively priced residential long distance service along with various on line capabilities including on line sign up  call detail and reports and credit card payment 
the company may incur significant expenses for the start up and development of the services contemplated in the agreement particularly during the second and third quarters of these costs may result in higher costs of sales in than historically experienced by the company 
gross margin 
gross margin  the gross profit as a percentage of sales  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was due to greater discounts obtained from at t on network usage partially offset by direct marketing expenses and higher volume discounts granted to certain partitions 
to the extent that the company may incur additional costs associated with obn  direct marketing and the aol agreement see cost of sales above gross margin may decline in the company believes that gross margins for obn long distance service will be higher than those for at t long distance service 
at t long distance service is bundled  which means that the company pays a single  all inclusive price to at t for switching  transmission  and lec access 
obn long distance service is unbundled  which means that the company provides its own switching  pays at t for transmission  and pays access fees directly to lecs 
the unbundled charges per call on obn are expected to be less than the bundled charge paid to at t 
although the basic rates of the three largest long distance carriers at t  mci and sprint have consistently increased over the past three years  at t and other carriers have announced new price plans and significantly simplified rate structures aimed at residential customers  the company s primary target audience under the aol agreement  which may have the impact of lowering overall long distance prices 
there can be no assurance that at t or other carriers will not make similar offerings available to the small to medium sized businesses that the company currently serves 
although obn is expected to make the company more price competitive  further reductions in long distance prices charged by competitors still may have a material adverse impact on the company s gross margin in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the costs associated with hiring additional management personnel to support the company s continuing growth and increased fees for professional services 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as it implements  operates and maintains obn  its direct marketing efforts and the rollout of the aol service offering 
these efforts will require additional personnel  equipment and support 
the additional selling  general and administrative expenses may be offset by the increased sales and profit gained as a result of the implementation of the components of the company s strategic plan  but increased costs may have an adverse impact on results of operations 
investment and other income 
investment and other income was million in versus  in investment and other income for the year ended december  includes two nonrecurring gains a million gain on the sale of securities of another long distance company and a million gain on the sale of short term us treasury securities 
the remainder of investment and other income consists primarily of interest income earned on the company s cash balances resulting primarily from the unapplied proceeds of the company s public offering in april and may and excess cash from operations 
as a result of the company s purchase of aba for approximately million in total consideration and the million initial payment to aol  interest income for future periods is expected to be significantly less than amounts realized in provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate declined to in from the pro forma effective tax rate of in due to the lower effective state tax rate in year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales increased by to million in from million in the increase in sales related primarily to the continued expansion of the company s distribution network of partitions  as well as increases in the number of end users obtained by the company s existing partitions 
as a result of the favorable contract tariffs obtained from at t  which took effect in july  revenue from marketing inbound service increased significantly in  totaling million for the year ended december  and accounting for approximately of sales compared to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the company s revenues for private line services represented approximately of sales compared to an insignificant amount from such services in cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales increased by to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the increase in sales by 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased at a higher rate than sales because the company offered higher volume discounts to certain partitions 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was attributable primarily to the addition of new partitions who received higher volume discounts 
billing costs remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales during both of these periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percentage of sales to from 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to the company s ability to spread its overhead expenses over a larger sales base 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the increase in personnel from to employees  resulting from the increased administrative and management demands on the company as it has grown  and an increase in fees for professional services 
pro forma income taxes 
on june   the company  with the consent of its stockholders  elected to be taxed as an s corporation 
as a result of the election  all earnings of the predecessor corporation were taxed directly to the stockholders 
accordingly  the statements of income  prior to the termination of the s corporation status on september   did not include provisions for income taxes 
pro forma income tax provisions have been calculated as if the company s results of operations were taxable as a c corporation under the internal revenue code for all periods presented

the primary reconciling item for the year ended december  was the tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options and warrants

generally  excess cash is invested primarily in short term government securities and cash equivalents consisting of money market accounts with major international brokerage firms 
the company has had to spend less of the proceeds of the stock offering to start up obn than originally planned because of the new at t contract tariff  which allows the company to avoid some of the costs associated with moving existing end users to obn and permits the company to phase in obn more cost effectively by not leasing transmission facilities before traffic levels are sufficient to fill them 
the company does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable due to the large number of partitions and end users comprising the company s customer base and their dispersion across different geographic regions

the aol agreement provides that million of the initial payment will be offset and recoverable by the company through reduction of such profit based marketing payments during the initial term of the aol agreement or  subject to certain monthly reductions by offset of the amount thereof  directly by aol upon certain earlier terminations of the aol agreement 
the million balance of the initial payment will be offset and is recoverable through a percentage of such profit based marketing payments made after the first five years of the aol agreement when extended beyond the initial term and by offset against a percentage of aol s share of the profits from the services after termination or expiration of the aol agreement 
any portion of the million not previously recovered or reduced in amount would be added to the million and would be recoverable similarly 
also under the aol agreement  the company issued to aol at signing two warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock at a premium over the market value of such stock on the issuance date 
one warrant is for million shares  at an exercise price of per share  one half of which shares will vest at the time the service is first made generally available to aol online network subscribers in accordance with the aol agreement or the first anniversary of the warrant issuance  whichever is earlier  and the balance of which will vest on the first anniversary of issuance if the aol agreement has not terminated

the company believes that the increased revenues to the company resulting from the aol agreement and the services offered pursuant thereto will be limited in  but could be significant in  although there can be no assurance that these results can be achieved in light of a number of uncertainties  including the following the company s ability to timely develop the online ordering  call detail  billing and customer services for the aol subscribers  which will require  among other things  being able to identify and employ sufficient personnel qualified to provide necessary programming  the company s and aol s ability to work effectively together to jointly develop the online marketing contemplated by the aol agreement  the response rate to online promotions of aol s online subscribers  most of whom are expected to be residential rather than businesses  which have historically been the company s customer base  the company s ability to expand obn to accommodate increased traffic levels  and aol s ability to successfully execute its publicly stated business plan and implement its announced network changes to improve subscriber access to its online service
