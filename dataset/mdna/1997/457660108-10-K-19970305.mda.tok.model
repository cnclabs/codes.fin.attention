as a result  insite vision will require substantial additional funds and the company may seek private or public equity investments  and possible future collaborative agreements and research funding to meet such needs 
even if the company does not have an immediate need for additional cash  it may seek access to the private or public equity markets if and when conditions are favorable 
there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for the company to finance its operations on acceptable terms  if at all
