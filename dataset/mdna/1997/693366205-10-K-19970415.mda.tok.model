physicians physicians was incorporated under the laws of ohio in september and was licensed by the ohio department in december physicians was formed with the sponsorship of the ohio state medical association osma to provide mpl insurance coverage to physicians who were members of the osma 
physicians was formed in response to a then existing crisis in the mpl insurance marketplace in ohio 
mpl claims had increased substantially in severity and frequency 
insurance companies providing mpl coverage responded in some cases by increasing premiums significantly or even by leaving the marketplace 
the osma sought to provide a stable insurance provider for its members in the face of this volatile mpl marketplace by forming physicians 
until  osma held shares representing a majority of physicians voting power 
physicians code of regulations also contained the requirement that three osma officers sit on physicians board of directors and that physicians only write mpl insurance for the osma members 
physicians secured the endorsement of its insurance products by the osma pursuant to an endorsement contract 
the strategic direction of physicians changed in first  physicians repurchased its shares from the osma and amended its code of regulations to delete the requirements that three osma officers sit on physicians board 
the mpl product endorsement was terminated and the three physicians directors who were affiliated with the osma resigned as directors

citation 
the following describes the history of pico  which was previously known as citation insurance group prior to the merger 
all references to cig are references to pico as it existed prior to the merger 
cig was a holding company principally engaged in writing workers compensation and commercial property and casualty insurance through its wholly owned subsidiaries  cic and cnic 
citation refers to cig and its subsidiaries  excluding citation general insurance company cgic as they existed before the merger 
cgic  a wholly owned subsidiary of cig  was placed into conservation in july by the state of california 
citation had effectively written off its investment in cgic in november  cic has historically specialized in providing workers compensation coverage for california businesses and  more recently  in arizona  colorado and utah 
in october  cic entered the commercial property and casualty business 
since that time  cic has underwritten general liability and property insurance for small and medium sized businesses with uniform risk characteristics and coverage needs 
cic typically provides general liability  theft  inland marine  property  glass and incidental products liability coverage 
commercial auto and umbrella liability are written for accounts where cic writes other lines of business 
in october  cig completed the acquisition of madison capital  inc and its subsidiaries madison for which cig issued  shares of its common stock and paid  to the former shareholders of madison in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding stock of madison 
madison was merged with and into cig and madison s former wholly owned subsidiaries  the canadian insurance company of california  california consumers insurance company and madison acceptance corporation  became wholly owned subsidiaries of cig 
in february  the names of the canadian insurance company of california and california consumers insurance company were changed to citation general insurance company  cgic  and citation national insurance company cnic  respectively 
cgic and cnic specialized in insuring accounts in commercial property oriented business classifications  including investment properties  retail operations  restaurants  wholesale distribution operations and other service related businesses 
until october they also provided coverage for artisan contractors 
madison acceptance corporation mac is licensed by the california department of corporations as an industrial loan company empowered to transact premium financing in california 
mac does not presently conduct premium financing operations 
during  citation increased cgic s loss reserves and  in the third quarter of  the increase in cgic s loss reserves aggregated approximately million 
these increases were due primarily to re evaluation of potential losses related to construction defect claims emanating from cgic s artisan contractor policies written in years prior to the merger 
subsequent to the third quarter loss reserve increases  citation notified the california department of insurance the california department that the cumulative effect of these increases brought cgic below the minimum surplus required by the state 
citation began working with the department to formulate a plan for resolving the situation 
based upon discussions with the department regarding the possible conservation of cgic  citation concluded that its control over cgic had become temporary and  as a result  has accounted for the results of cgic on the equity method since november  resulting in a write off of its remaining investment in cgic of million at that date 
at that time  cgic and cnic stopped writing any new business 
in february  citation reached an agreement in principle with the department regarding cgic 
under the terms of the agreement  an inter company pooling reinsurance agreement between cgic and cnic was commuted effective september  in addition  cnic transferred approximately million of securities into a contingency fund for potential further development of cgic s loss reserves associated with accident years to during which time the inter company pooling agreement was in effect 
further  cig agreed to pay  in cash to cgic and transfer its ownership of cig s costa mesa property to cgic 
as a result of this agreement cig recorded a liability for the cost of the disposition of cgic  which includes the above described payments and transfers which  when combined with its write off of its investment in cgic  resulted in a million charge to citation s operating results in further  cic agreed to acquire the in force book of business of cgic for approximately million  which amount was accrued as a liability of citation and recorded as an other asset at december  during july  cgic was placed into conservation by the state of california  effectively transferring control of cgic s assets to the california department 
in august  cgic was placed into liquidation by the state of california 
on november   cig contributed all of the capital stock of cnic to cic 
this transaction increased the paid in and contributed surplus of cic by  cnic has been essentially inactive since mid december in february  citation entered the personal automobile insurance business in california by offering low limit policies marketed through a managing general agent 
primarily as a result of poor operating results in this line  citation decided in early to withdraw from this business and focus on its primary business segments ie  workers compensation and commercial property and casualty 
cic is currently licensed to write business in arizona  california  colorado  hawaii  nevada  new mexico and utah and is currently writing business in arizona  california  colorado  nevada and utah

recent developments 
in november  physicians purchased a million convertible debenture from pc quote  inc physicians currently owns approximately of pc quote  inc s outstanding shares 
pc quote  inc 
is an electronic provider of real time securities quotations and news 
in january  cic entered into a letter of intent to sell its workers compensation business to an unaffiliated insurance company 
on april   gec and pico entered into an agreement for the purchase of nevada land and resource company  llc  owner of approximately  acres of deeded land in northern nevada  for a total purchase price of million 
the closing date is scheduled for april  operations 
the company operates in five industry segments  portfolio investing  property and casualty insurance  life and health insurance  mpl and other 
physicians discontinued writing mpl insurance at the end of but continues to administer the adjustment of claims and the investment of related assets 
citation is currently negotiating for the sale of its workers compensation operations  principally due to recent changes in california regulations with regard to rating of policies and to better utilize capital and concentrate on the synergies of the property and casualty insurance businesses common to both sequoia and citation 
there can be no assurance that citation will be successful in selling the workers compensation operations on favorable terms  if at all 
portfolio investing operations in late  physicians began the process of changing its strategic direction from the operation of an mpl insurance business to investing in businesses which pico believes are undervalued or will benefit from additional capital  restructuring of operations or management or improved competitiveness through operational efficiencies with existing pico operations 
accordingly  in january  physicians reactivated its investment advisory subsidiary  summit  in august physicians acquired sequoia and entered new lines of property and casualty insurance  in september physicians purchased of gec  a canadian corporation active in international investment banking  agricultural services  water rights  and other businesses and in physicians acquired control of citation pursuant to the merger 
due to the company s limited experience in the operation of the businesses of each of these subsidiaries  which currently constitute a substantial portion of the company s operations  there can be no assurance as to the future operating results of the company or the recently acquired businesses of the company 
the company will continue to make selective investments for the purpose of enhancing and realizing additional value by means of appropriate levels of shareholder influence and control 
this could involve the restructuring of the financing or management of the entities in which the company invests and initiating and facilitating mergers and acquisitions 
this business strategy has only recently been implemented  however  and it is not reflected in prior years financial statements  nor are the financial statements indicative of possible results of this new business strategy in the future 
shareholders will be relying on the experience and judgment of the company s management to locate  select and develop new acquisition and investment opportunities 
there can be no assurance that sufficient opportunities will be found or that this business strategy will be successful 
failure to successfully implement this strategy may negatively impact the business and financial condition and results of operations of the company 
application of physicians new strategy since has resulted in a greater concentration of equity investments held by physicians  and consequently  the company 
market values of equity securities are subject to changes in the stock market  which may cause the company s shareholders equity to fluctuate from period to period 
at times  the company may come to hold securities of companies for which no market exists or which may be subject to restrictions on resale 
as a result  periodically  a portion of the company s assets may not be readily marketable

premiums 
the following table shows the total net premiums written gross premiums less premiums ceded pursuant to reinsurance treaties by line of business by the company and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated as reported in financial statements filed with the ohio department and the california department using statutory accounting principles net premiums written by line of business in thousands property and casualty   medical professional liability   total property and casualty premiums    life and health individual life   health annuity    group life health  annuity total life and health insurance premiums    total premiums    physicians experienced significant declines in mpl net premiums written over the period described 
net premiums equal direct premiums plus assumed premiums  minus premiums ceded under reinsurance treaties 
the amount of reinsurance assumed by physicians over the years has been negligible 
however  direct mpl premiums written have declined significantly  from million in to million in and to million in additionally  mpl premiums ceded under reinsurance treaties have varied greatly from year to year 
see reinsurance 
apl s premium writings have also declined significantly since  mostly as a result of exiting the group health insurance business in mid interest in apl s critical illness policy  survivor key  has been less than expected and not enough to offset the decline in health premiums 
nevertheless  premiums received for this product have increased in recent quarters 
sequoia s property and casualty premium writings are included only for the period august through december  and for all of citation s premiums are included only for the period after november  property and casualty insurance three of the company s subsidiaries  sequoia  cic and cnic underwrite property and casualty insurance in california and  to a lesser extent in arizona  colorado  nevada and utah 
sequoia is licensed to write insurance in california and is represented by approximately independent insurance agents and by physicians wholly owned subsidiary insurance agency  clm 
sequoia writes primarily light commercial and multiperil insurance in northern and central california 
sequoia s principal sources of premium production represent farm insurance and small to medium sized commercial accounts  most of which are located outside of large urban areas 
a small amount of earthquake coverage is provided  either as an endorsement to an existing insurance policy or as a result of participation in a state mandated pool 
most business is written at independently filed rates 
cic underwrites general liability and property insurance for small and medium sized businesses  including restaurants  hotels and motels  retail stores  owners of small commercial centers  and until october  artisan contractors  with uniform risk characteristics and coverage needs 
cic targets specific types of accounts within predetermined business classifications containing certain characteristics including low potential for loss severity  no long delay between loss occurrence and loss reporting  and a relatively short and uncomplicated claim settlement process 
cic typically provides general liability  theft  inland marine  property  glass  commercial automobile  incidental products liability coverage and umbrella liability 
cic sells policies through approximately independent producers located in its operating territories 
net earned premiums  incurred losses and corresponding loss ratio excluding lae for sequoia and citation for were dollars in thousands   and  respectively

the underwriting staffs of sequoia  cic  and cnic the p c insurance group are solely responsible for the ultimate acceptance  underwriting and pricing of applications for commercial insurance 
premium pricing levels are based on a variety of factors  including industry historical loss costs  anticipated loss costs  acceptable profit margins and anticipated operating expenses 
the objective of pricing structures in all product lines is to provide sufficient funds to pay all costs of policy issuance and administration  premium taxes and losses and related claims handling expenses and provide a profit margin as well 
because pricing structures are based on estimates of future loss patterns developed from historical information and because losses and expenses may differ substantially from estimates  product pricing may ultimately prove inadequate 
factors causing inadequate rates may include catastrophic losses or a lack of correlation between the loss forecast for the market and that applicable to the customers which actually purchase the policies 
in addition  if underlying statistical information understates the value of known claims  forecasts may understate prospective claims patterns 
the p c insurance group s policy is to settle valid claims promptly and equitably 
the p c insurance group employs claim technicians  located in various locations throughout california  to administer the claim settlement process 
it is the p c insurance group s policy to limit the number of claims assigned to each technician  based in part on the complexity of the individual claims 
it is also the p c insurance group s policy that the most experienced technicians handle the most complex claims 
in general  claims in litigation are the most complex and require the most experienced personnel 
the company s claim staff  working closely with claim department supervisors  may retain independent adjusters  appraisers and defense counsel  based on the nature of the claim 
in addition  the p c insurance group has implemented procedures and programs to detect and investigate claim fraud and believes that  to date  these programs have resulted in substantial savings relative to the claimed amounts involved 
sequoia has expended considerable effort and expense in streamlining and reordering its operations in the latter part of and in computer systems have been developed to facilitate decentralization of underwriting and claims adjusting functions 
as a result  in may  sequoia terminated its home office lease agreement and entered into a short term lease arrangement for substantially less office space at a nearby location 
this may result in a significant savings to sequoia over time and provides greater flexibility for the future 
the p c insurance group has emphasized the development and maintenance of information and processing systems for use in all areas of its business 
management believes that its information and processing systems enable the insurance group to compete effectively through enhanced policyholder services  efficient underwriting  claim support systems  reduced processing costs and timely management information 
in addition  cic s systems are not dependent on specific hardware vendors  thereby providing it with greater control over hardware costs and flexibility in terms of operating hardware 
an internally integrated software system has been designed for the processing of cic s workers compensation and commercial property and casualty business  including automated policy issuance and claim processing 
cic s claim function has been supported by its on line automated claim system  which has been internally developed and refined over several years 
cnic s claims functions have been integrated into cic s automated system and are being supported by this system 
utilizing this system  claim technicians have on line  direct access to all claim files through their own computer terminal 
cic and sequoia collect premiums either by direct billing or producer billing 
sequoia has recently developed its own direct billing system and began utilizing this system for all new and renewal policies  thereby eliminating its reliance on the outside service vendor 
the workers compensation direct billing program is supported by cig s in house automated system 
cic  cnic and sequoia each write property and casualty insurance policies 
most of cic s  cnic s and sequoia s net premiums are attributable to property and casualty 
the property and casualty insurance industry has been highly cyclical  and the industry has been in a cyclical downturn over the last several years due primarily to premium rate competition  which has resulted in lower profitability 
premium rate levels are related to the availability of insurance coverage  which varies according to the level of surplus in the industry 
the level of surplus in the industry varies with returns on invested capital and regulatory barriers to withdrawal of surplus 
increases in surplus have generally been accompanied by increased price competition among property and casualty insurers 
the cyclical trends in the industry and the industry s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including natural disasters such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes and fires  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment which affect market prices of insurance companies investments and the income from those investments  inflationary pressures that affect the size of losses and judicial decisions affecting insurers liabilities 
the demand for property and casualty insurance can also vary significantly  generally rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as such activity decreases 
workers compensation workers compensation is a no fault statutory system  which requires an employer to provide its employees with medical care  disability payments and other specified benefits for work related injuries or illnesses 
employers typically purchase workers compensation insurance to provide these benefits  which are statutorily established 
cic currently writes workers compensation policies  however  the company has entered into a letter of intent to sell its workers compensation business 
see recent developments 
mpl prior to the sale of the mpl insurance business in august  physicians and pro sold only mpl coverage 
physicians and pro were represented by approximately independent insurance agents and by physicians wholly owned subsidiary insurance agency  pico insurance agency  inc while physicians and pro were licensed collectively in the states of ohio  kentucky  michigan  west virginia and wisconsin  mpl coverage was actively sold only in ohio and kentucky 
physicians and pro continue to administer the adjustment of claims and the investment of related assets for policies written or renewed prior to july life and health apl is represented on a commission basis by approximately independent agents  some of whom may also be licensed with other unaffiliated companies 
apl  an ohio domiciled life insurer  has written life  annuity and group health insurance since its inception in in july   apl began marketing a critical illness policy which apl believed was unique to the us market 
in the face of heightened competition for group health insurance and to concentrate on the survivor key product  on july   apl ceased writing group  health and dental coverages with the exception of the physicians group plans  which were terminated in march to date  response to apl s critical illness policy  survivor key  has been less than expected but is increasing

liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for unpaid loss and lae are estimated based upon actual and industry experience  and assumptions and projections as to claims frequency  severity and inflationary trends and settlement payments 
such estimates may vary from the eventual outcome 
the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves is particularly acute for lines of business for which both reported and paid losses develop over an extended period of time 
several years or more may elapse between the occurrence of an insured mpl  workers compensation or casualty loss  the reporting of the loss and the final payment of the loss 
loss reserves are estimates of what an insurer expects to pay claimants  legal and investigative costs and claims administrative costs 
the company s subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves for payment of estimated losses and loss adjustment expense for both reported claims and claims which have occurred but have not yet been reported ibnr 
ultimate actual liabilities may be materially more or less than current reserve estimates 
reserves for reported claims are established on a case by case basis 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for ibnr are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  the regulatory environment  benefit levels  economic conditions  judicial administration of claims  general trends in claim severity and frequency  medical costs and other factors which could affect the adequacy of loss reserves 
management reviews and adjusts ibnr reserves regularly 
the liabilities for unpaid losses and lae for physicians  pro  sequoia  cic and cnic  the combined insurance group were million in  million in and million in  net of discount on mpl reserves 
of those amounts  the liabilities for unpaid loss and lae of prior years increased by million in and million in and decreased by million in these changes in reserves for prior years reserves were due to the following decrease in provision for prior year claims retroactive reinsurance accretion of reserve discount net increase decrease in liabilities for unpaid loss and lae of prior years see schedule in note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding reserve changes 
although the combined insurance group s reserves are certified annually by independent actuaries as required by state law  significant fluctuations in reserve levels can occur based upon a number of variables used in actuarial projections of ultimate incurred losses and lae 
significant changes in estimates of mpl reserves occurred at year end in part in  but to a greater extent in  data indicated projected occurrence frequency had stabilized and projected severity was lower based on current data 
both incurred and paid development methods reflected more stable and internally consistent results which were lower than levels and  in  lower than levels 
given that all methods at december  affirmed the early signals of improvement in  projected ultimate incurred losses and lae were adjusted for the prior years 
excess loss layers losses greater than  were more significantly impacted because the aforementioned improvement in basic limits projections flows into the excess loss projection estimation process and was supplemented by a more thorough study of excess loss levels that also indicated favorable development for this layer of exposure physicians excess experience was determined to be more favorable relative to prior indications 
in combination  these changes across all coverage types basic and excess limits  occurrence  claims made and tail resulted in the large reduction in ultimates at december  versus ultimates at december  shown in the roll forward of reserves schedule in note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
physicians liability for unpaid mpl losses and lae is discounted to reflect investment income as permitted by the ohio department 
the method of discounting is based upon historical payment patterns and assumes an interest rate at or below physicians investment yield  and is the same rate used for statutory reporting purposes 
prior to  direct and assumed mpl reserves were discounted at a rate of for and prior accident years  for the accident year  for accident years  and  and for the and accident years 
in  physicians lowered its discount rate to for all accident years resulting in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
all members of the p c insurance group seek to reduce the loss that may arise from individually significant claims or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk with other insurance carriers 
in  physicians entered into a specific excess reinsurance treaty covering million of losses in excess of the million retention after a one time deductible of an aggregate million of losses in excess of million on losses incurred during the period january  through june  the million of premiums paid under this treaty has been accounted for as a deposit 
physicians entered into two other treaties in one treaty covers  of losses in excess of the  retention and the other treaty covers million of losses in excess of million 
both treaties cover policies issued or renewed after july   and contain elements of retroactive and prospective risk transfers 
the effects on reserves of the accounting for the retroactive portions of these treaties under sfas no

analysis of loss and loss adjustment expense development the following table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for through for all property and casualty line of business including mpl 
the net liability as originally estimated line shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date on a discounted basis for each of the indicated years 
reserves for other lines of business that physicians ceased writing in  which are immaterial  are excluded

for example  the amount of the redundancy related to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the decrease or increase amount for  and conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
for example  physicians commuted reinsurance contracts in several different years that significantly increased the estimate of net reserves for prior years by reducing the recoverable loss and lae reserves for those years 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future increase or decreases based on this table 
the data in the above table is based on schedule p from the combined insurance group s to annual statements  as filed with state insurance departments  however  the development table above differs from the development displayed in schedule p  part  as schedule p  part excludes unallocated lae 
loss reserve experience 
the inherent uncertainties in estimating loss reserves are greater for some insurance products than for others  and are dependent on the length of the reporting tail associated with a given product  the diversity of historical development patterns among various aggregations of claims  the amount of historical information available during the estimation process  the degree of impact that changing regulations and legal precedents may have on open claims  and the consistency of reinsurance programs over time  among other things 
because mpl  workers compensation and commercial casualty claims may not be fully paid for several years or more  estimating reserves for such claims can be more uncertain than estimating reserves in other lines of insurance 
as a result  precise reserve estimates cannot be made for several years following a current accident year for which reserves are initially established 
there can be no assurance that the insurance subsidiaries in the combined insurance group and apl have established reserves adequate to meet the ultimate cost of losses arising from such claims 
it has been necessary  and will over time continue to be necessary  for the insurance companies to review and make appropriate adjustments to reserves for estimated ultimate losses  lae  future policy benefits  claims payables and annuity and other policyholder funds 
to the extent reserves prove to be inadequate  the insurance companies would have to adjust their reserves and incur a charge to earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company

see recent developments 
reinsurance risks as with other property and casualty insurers  cic s  cnic s  and sequoia s operating results and financial condition can be adversely affected by volatile and unpredictable natural and man made disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  fires and explosions 
cic  cnic  and sequoia generally seek to reduce their exposure to such events through individual risk selection and the purchase of reinsurance 
cic s  cnic s and sequoia s estimates of their exposures depend on their views of the possibility of a catastrophic event in a given area and on the probable maximum loss to cic  cnic or sequoia should such an event occur 
while cic  cnic and sequoia attempt to limit their exposure to acceptable levels  it is possible that an actual catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could significantly exceed the probable maximum loss previously assumed  resulting in a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the future financial results of the insurance subsidiaries could be adversely affected by disputes with their respective reinsurers with respect to coverage and by the solvency of such reinsurers 
none of the company s insurance subsidiaries is aware of actual or potential disputes with any of their respective reinsurers that could materially and adversely impact the financial results of the company or is aware of any insolvent reinsurer whose current obligations to cic  cnic  physicians  pro  apl or sequoia are material to such companies 
competition there are several hundred property and casualty insurers licensed in california  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the p c insurance group and offer more diversified types of insurance coverage  have greater financial resources and have greater distribution capabilities than the p c insurance group 
am best best 
best has recently assigned sequoia a rating of b very good and apl has had a best rating of b very good since cic is currently rated b adequate and cnic is currently rated c marginal by best 
physicians and pro are currently rated  and have been for a number of years  nr rating procedure inapplicable 
best s ratings reflect the assessment of am best and company of the insurer s financial condition as well as the expertise and experience of its management 
therefore  best ratings are important to policyholders 
best ratings are subject to review and change over time 
there can be no assurance that sequoia or apl will maintain their ratings 
if sequoia or apl fail to maintain their current ratings  it would possibly have a material adverse effect on their ability to write new insurance policies as well as potentially reduce their ability to maintain or increase market share 
as a result of the reported losses and the increase in reserves  primarily from construction defect claims  in  best reduced its rating of cnic from b to c which rating has subsequently been increased to c and in reduced its rating of cic from b to b 
management believes that many potential customers will not insure with an insurer that carries a best rating of less than b  and that customers who do so will demand lower rate structures 
in addition  there can be no assurances that cic s or cnic s best ratings will be maintained or increased 
there is fierce competition in the property and casualty insurance industry which is populated by large insurers doing business on a countrywide basis  as well as regional and local insurers 
insurers compete on the basis of price  product  and service 
many of the competitors in the market have higher ratings from best as well as other financial rating services and offer a broader array of coverages than do cic  cnic  and sequoia 
commercial insurance markets are commodity oriented  highly fragmented and reflective of intense price competition 
nevertheless  because each commercial risk is somewhat unique in terms of insurance exposure  different insurers can develop widely divergent estimates of prospective losses 
most insurers attempt to segment classes within commercial markets so that they target the more profitable sub classes with lower  although adequate rates  given the estimated profitability of the segment 
in some cases  no statistics are available for the sub classes involved  and the insurer implements discounted rate structures based solely on theoretical judgment 
finally  different insurers have widely divergent internal expense positions  due to method of distribution  scale economies and efficiency of operations 
therefore  although insurance is a commodity  the price of insurance does not necessarily reflect commodity pricing 
sequoia s and cic s ability to attract and retain customers results from price structures which have been tailored to attract certain sub segments of the commercial insurance market 
in addition  several of their competitors have either restricted writings in california or have withdrawn from the state due to a variety of competitive pressures and adverse litigation and regulatory climates 
however  cic s  cnic s and sequoia s marketing is focused in a limited number of commercial business classifications 
in general  these classifications are considered preferred by most competitors because of historically profitable results realized from underwriting such classifications 
cic s  cnic s and sequoia s customer bases and prospective revenues are vulnerable to the pricing actions of larger or more efficient competitors who target cic s  cnic s and sequoia s desired classifications or individual policyholders and offer substantially lower rates 
the life and health insurance industry is highly competitive 
there are approximately life and health insurers licensed in ohio  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than apl 
apl currently is rated b very good by best 
apl is  to the company s knowledge  the only life insurance company in the us offering a critical illness policy which pays a lump sum benefit equal to the face amount even if the insured is not terminally ill in contemplation of death within twelve months 
this critical illness policy  which is called survivor key  is the main focus of apl s marketing efforts 
physicians and its subsidiaries no longer compete in the mpl industry 
cic and cnic are in the process of selling their workers compensation businesses 
see recent developments 
regulation physicians  cic and their respective insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive state regulatory oversight in the jurisdictions in which they are organized and in the jurisdictions in which they do business 
physicians  pro  apl  sequoia  cic and cnic investments are strictly regulated by investment statutes in their states of domicile 
in general  these investment laws place limits on the amounts of investment in any one company  the owned percentage of any one company and the quality of investments and seek to ensure the claims paying ability of the insurer 
ohio has enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems  including physicians and its insurance subsidiaries 
each insurance company in the holding company system is required to register with the ohio department and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
pursuant to these laws  the ohio department may examine physicians and or its insurance subsidiaries at any time and require disclosure of and or approval of material transactions involving the insurers within the system  such as extraordinary dividends from any one of physicians or any of its insurance subsidiaries 
all material transactions within the holding company system affecting physicians or its ohio domiciled insurance subsidiaries must be fair and reasonable 
sequoia  cic and cnic are subject to similar legislation in california 
ohio insurance law provides that no person may acquire direct or indirect control of physicians  pro or apl unless it has obtained the prior written approval of the ohio superintendent of insurance for such acquisition unless such transaction is exempt 
similarly  california insurance law provides that no person may acquire direct or indirect control of sequoia or cic unless it has obtained the prior written approval of the california insurance commissioner of such acquisition 
since physicians  pro and apl are domiciled in ohio  the ohio department is the principal supervisor and regulator of each of these companies 
since sequoia  cic and cnic are domiciled in california  the california insurance commissioner is its principal supervisor and regulator 
however  each of the companies are also subject to supervision and regulation in the states in which they transact business  and such supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of an insurance company s business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is to ensure financial stability of insurance companies for the protection of policyholders 
the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad regulatory powers relative to granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating trade practices  required statutory financial statements  and prescribing the types and amount of investments permitted 
although premium rate regulations vary among states and lines of insurance  such regulations generally require approval of the regulatory authority prior to any changes in rates 
insurance companies are required to file detailed annual reports with the insurance departments in each of the states in which they do business  and their financial condition and market conduct are subject to examination by such agencies at any time 
physicians  pro and apl are restricted by the insurance laws of ohio as to the amount of dividends they may pay without prior approval 
the maximum dividend that may be paid during any year without the prior approval of the ohio department is limited to the greater of of the insurer s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding december or the net income of the insurer for the year ended the previous december any dividend paid from other than earned surplus is considered to be an extraordinary dividend and must be approved 
in january  approximately million and million will be available for payment by physicians and apl  respectively  without the prior approval of the ohio department 
no amounts were available for payment by pro 
the california insurance code limits the amount of dividends or distributions an insurance subsidiary may pay in any month period without days prior written notice to the commissioner to the greater of a net income for the preceding year as determined under statutory accounting principles or b of statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding december insurers may pay dividends only from earned surplus 
payments of dividends in excess of these amounts may only be made if the commissioner has not disapproved such payment  or specifically approves such payment  within the day period 
the insurance industry is also affected by court decisions 
premium rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit 
these rates contemplate a certain level of risk 
the courts may undercut insurers expectations with respect to the level of risk being assumed in a number of ways  including eliminating exclusions  multiplying limits of coverage and creating rights for policyholders not set forth in the contract 
these decisions can adversely affect an insurer s profitability 
recently  the naic and state insurance regulators have been examining existing laws and regulations  with an emphasis on insurance company investment and solvency issues  risk based capital guidelines  interpretations of existing laws  the development of new laws and the implementation of nonstatutory guidelines 
from time to time  legislation has also been introduced in congress that would result in the federal government assuming some role in the regulation of the insurance industry 
each of the company s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by such state guaranty associations to fund the insurance obligations of insolvent insurers 
there can be no assurance that such assessments will not have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
however  assessments are calculated based upon market share and none of the company s insurance subsidiaries has a significant market share in any line of business in any jurisdiction 
the regulation and supervision of insurance companies by state agencies is designed principally for the benefit of their policyholders  not their stockholders 
in addition  mac is subject to regulation by the california department of corporations  which includes various requirements relating to the financial condition of mac as well as all aspects of the marketing of premium financing 
the california department completed its latest market conduct examination of sequoia and cnic in and of cic in the california department has also completed a financial examination of cgic and cnic in covering the three years ended december   but also included an extension of the review to december  with regard to the adequacy of cic s and cnic s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of that date 
the california department s final examination report did not require either company to take any action 
the california department is conducting financial examinations of cic and cnic covering the three year period ended december  the california department s final examination report has not yet been released 
the california department has also initiated a financial examination of sequoia covering through examinations are routinely scheduled every three years 
the ohio department recently completed its regular triennial examinations of physicians  pro and apl 
nothing of significance was reported 
in july  the california legislature enacted a series of seven bills to significantly change the california workers compensation system the reforms 
the reforms increase costs as a result of benefit increases commencing july  and continuing through july  in addition  the reforms reduced revenues through an immediate reduction in minimum rates of 
the legislation permitted the insurance commissioner to approve rates even lower 
effective january   the insurance commissioner ordered a further reduction in minimum rates and a reduction in minimum rates effective october  effective january  california s minimum rate law was replaced by a competitive rating system 
the reforms contain numerous other provisions  including limitations on grounds for cancellation of policies 
the company is in the process of selling its workers compensation business 
see recent developments 
proposed federal legislation has been introduced from time to time in recent years that would provide the federal government with substantial power to regulate property and casualty insurers including state workers compensation systems  primarily through the establishment of uniform solvency standards 
proposals also have been discussed to modify or repeal the antitrust exemption for insurance companies provided by the mccarran ferguson act 
the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse impact upon the operations of the company 
proposition  a ballot initiative passed by california voters on november   requires rate rollbacks and prior approval of rates and imposes other requirements on property and casualty insurers 
proposition  by its terms  does not apply to workers compensation insurance  but does apply to the types of property and casualty insurance that sequoia and cic write 
the rate rollback provisions of proposition do not apply to cic nor cnic since neither company commenced writing property and casualty insurance prior to the effective date of proposition beginning on november   insurance rates may be increased only after application to and approval by the insurance commissioner and  under certain circumstances  after a public hearing 
in june  cic received final approval from the california department for its inland marine and other liability rate filings 
sequoia has fulfilled its proposition rate rollback obligation and received approval from california for its rate filings 
since  numerous rates and underwriting rules have been filed by cic and approved by the california department including certain rate increases 
no assurance can be given as to what actions  if any  the california department will take with respect to the ultimate approval of cic s remaining interim rate filings or future rate filings 
the california insurance commissioner issued emergency regulations that  if and when adopted  would repeal the prior approval procedures and regulations in effect when cic s interim notices of approval were received in these emergency regulations focus on rate rollbacks and procedures and substantive standards regarding approvals of future rates including determining rates by reference to rates of return 
administrative proceedings and court challenges relating to these regulations have been continuous 
most recently  the california supreme court reversed an earlier california superior court ruling that held proposition did not authorize the california insurance commissioner to adopt substantive regulations for the determination of the liability of insurers for rate rollbacks and that each insurer is entitled to a separate hearing to demonstrate to the california insurance commissioner that the cap on insurers returns as set forth in the emergency regulations should not apply to it 
the united states supreme court has since refused to hear an appeal of the california supreme court s decision 
the company cannot predict what the ultimate outcome of these issues will be or what procedures and substantive standards ultimately may be adopted by the insurance commissioner 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected by such adopted regulations 
substantially all liabilities resulting from the roll back of insurance rates under proposition had been settled or reserved for prior to physicians purchase of sequoia 
proposition also subjects the insurance industry to california antitrust and unfair business practices laws although the relevant provision of proposition may only apply to automobile and certain other insurers  prohibits cancellation or nonrenewal of insurance policies except for specified reasons and provides that the insurance commissioner shall be an elected official 
beginning in  physicians  pro  apl  cic  cnic and sequoia became subject to the provisions of the risk based capital for insurers model act the model act which has been adopted by the naic for the purpose of helping regulators identify property and casualty insurers that may be in financial difficulty 
the model act contains a formula which takes into account asset risk  credit risk  underwriting risk and all other relevant risks 
under this formula  each insurer is required to report to regulators using formulas which measure the quality of its capital and the relationship of its modified capital base to the level of risk assumed in specific aspects of its operations 
the formula does not address all of the risks associated with the operations of an insurer 
the formula is intended to provide a minimum threshold measure of capital adequacy by individual insurance company and does not purport to compute a target level of capital 
companies which fall below the threshold will be placed into one of four categories company action level  where the insurer must submit a plan of corrective action  regulatory action level  where the insurer must submit such a plan and the regulator will issue a corrective order  authorized control level  which includes the above actions and may include rehabilitation or liquidation  and mandatory control level  where the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
the model act is not expected to cause any material change in any of the insurance companies future operations 
all companies risk based capital results as of december  exceed their minimum thresholds

whereas citation insurance group was predominantly engaged in property and casualty operations  pico holdings  inc operates primarily as an insurance and investment company  specializing in portfolio investing  property and casualty insurance  life and health insurance  and investment management and other services 
these changes are a result of the november  merger of physicians insurance company of ohio and a subsidiary of citation insurance group  in which physicians insurance company of ohio was the surviving corporation 
upon consummation of the merger  citation insurance group changed its name to pico holdings  inc for accounting purposes the transaction has been treated as a reverse acquisition with physicians insurance company of ohio being the acquiror 
as a result  these financial statements reflect prior years data of physicians insurance company of ohio and its subsidiaries and affiliates only 
neither citation insurance group s prior years results or account balances  nor operating results prior to the merger have been included in these financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions for further information on the accounting treatment of the reverse acquisition 
background prior to july   the effective date of physicians and pro s quota share reinsurance of their mpl businesses with mutual and the subsequent sale of the rights to these mpl books of business  effective january   the physicians group of affiliated companies consisted primarily of two property and casualty insurance companies writing mpl insurance physicians and pro and one life and health insurance company  apl 
in november  the respective boards of directors of physicians and pro determined that it was in the best interests of physicians and pro and their respective shareholders to sell their mpl insurance businesses 
this sale was part of an overall shift in the strategic direction of physicians and pro 
on august   physicians purchased sequoia  a california property and casualty insurance company writing light commercial and multiple peril insurance in northern and central california 
sequoia does not write mpl insurance 
on september   physicians purchased of the common stock of gec  a canadian company operating in portfolio investments  agricultural services  and other business segments 
on november   physicians and its subsidiaries merged with a subsidiary of cig and cig then changed its name to pico holdings  inc this reverse acquisition brought two more california property and casualty insurance companies  cic and cnic  into the affiliated group and provided a non insurance holding company able to engage in portfolio investing and other activities with fewer restrictions than those imposed upon insurance companies 
in addition to the operation of its subsidiaries  the company s objective is to use its resources and those of its subsidiaries and affiliates to increase shareholder value through investments in businesses that the company believes are undervalued 
the company s acquisition philosophy is to make selective investments  predominantly in public companies  for the purpose of enhancing and realizing additional value by means of appropriate levels of shareholder influence and control 
this could involve the restructuring of the financing or management of the companies in which the company invests 
it may also encompass initiating and facilitating mergers and acquisitions within the relevant industry to achieve constructive rationalization 
this business strategy was adopted in late  but was not fully implemented in and  therefore  the results of this business strategy are not fully reflected in the historical financial statements 
the company s operations are organized into five segments portfolio investing  life and health insurance  mpl insurance  property and casualty insurance  and other operations 
results of operations years ended december   and summary pico reported net income of million  or per share for  compared with net income of million  or per share during  and million  or per share in prior years per share calculations have been adjusted for comparison purposes to reflect the november  merger between physicians and citation 
year to year comparisons are somewhat distorted as a result of the inclusion of sequoia beginning august  and the addition of the citation group effective november  excluding sequoia s post acquisition net loss of million and net income of million  in addition to citation s post merger income of  net income would have been million for and million for compared to million in shareholders equity per share increased during  principally as a result of the november merger with citation and the company s million net income 
shareholders equity per share at december  was  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
prior years per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the november merger 
unrealized appreciation of investment holdings decreased million during  net of taxes 
of this million decrease  million was due to the sale of fairfield communities  inc fairfield  which produced a pre tax realized gain of more than million 
one of physicians common stock holdings  pc quote  declined more than million in market value during  after taxes 
however  at december   the market value of this security was still above physicians cost 
excluding fairfield and the decline in the value of pc quote  physicians unrealized investment gains actually increased more than million  after tax during shareholders equity increased million  or compared to year end in addition to million in net income and the million decrease in net unrealized appreciation  this increase included million in equity from the citation reverse acquisition  and a million reduction in equity during the second quarter of due to recording percent of the  pre merger shares of physicians stock purchased by gec as treasury shares 
gec is recorded on the equity basis in the company s financial statements  rather than at market value  due to the company s level of control and operational involvement 
however  this increase in shareholders equity did not include negative goodwill of million recorded on the company s books as a result of the merger 
this million negative goodwill will increase the company s income by  each year over the next ten years  or until otherwise removed from pico s books 
realized investment gains accounted for million of pre tax operating income  principally as a result of the sale of physicians and apl s holdings in fairfield common stock during the fourth quarter 
during  the company s assets increased million to million 
much of this increase was due to the reverse acquisition 
revenues increased million over and million over increases were realized in all segments except mpl insurance  which is no longer being written 
pre tax operating income also showed significant increases over and in all segments except other  which was heavily influenced by operating losses of physicians percent owned subsidiary  stonebrige partners ag stonebridge  a european broker of annuities and other insurance products 
revenues and pre tax operating income by segment are shown in the following schedules operating revenues year ended december  in millions portfolio investing life and health insurance property and casualty insurance medical professional liability insurance other revenue from operations pre tax operating income year ended december  in millions portfolio investing life and health insurance property and casualty insurance medical professional liability insurance other total pre tax operating income portfolio investing portfolio investing operations are principally conducted by physicians within certain regulatory guidelines established by the ohio department 
it is expected that pico  the holding company  will also engage in portfolio investing in the future as assets become available at the holding company level 
investment income revenues and realized investment gains or losses generated by physicians and pro are first allocated to mpl equal to the amount of loss reserve discount accretion recorded during the period 
the remainder is shown as portfolio investing revenue 
for a number of reasons  including the existence of an experienced claims adjustment staff and physicians success in managing invested assets  physicians decided that it could more effectively manage the assets remaining after the sale of the mpl business than to sell off or fully reinsure the existing reserves 
as a result  assets are managed for the maximum overall return  within prudent safety margins and the guidelines of the ohio department 
assets are not designated on an individual item basis as either mpl or portfolio investing assets 
as a result  physicians invested assets produce income in both mpl and portfolio investing segments without any true segregation of assets 
revenues from portfolio investing operations of million increased million over the million reported for and surpassed the million level by million 
portfolio investing revenues are shown below portfolio investing year ended december  in millions revenues realized investment gains investment income portfolio investing revenues nearly all of the million portfolio investing revenues  or million  was attributable to realized investment gains 
these gains were principally a result of the sale of physicians investment in fairfield common stock  a strategic value investment identified late in realized investment gains attributable to portfolio investing for and were million and million  respectively 
fairfield common stock was one of the first strategic investments made by physicians during its transition from strictly an mpl insurance operation to an insurance and investment company 
numerous strategic investments have since been made 
nearly all have appreciated 
unrealized investment gains at december   net of income taxes  amounted to million 
this does not include all of the appreciation of pico s global equity corporation common stock  since gec is recorded on pico s books at gec s equity value which  per share  is less than the december  market value of the gec stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management believes its new strategic focus is succeeding as well as or better than expected  as evidenced by the company s growth during the past two to three years 
the company intends to continue to make selective investments for the purpose of enhancing and realizing additional value by means of appropriate levels of shareholder influence and control  as well as to operate its subsidiaries to obtain maximum shareholder value 
nevertheless  while past results are very encouraging  future results cannot and should not be predicted based upon past performance alone 
the decline in investment income compared to was principally due to a significant shift in the mix of the company s investment portfolio from interest bearing fixed maturity and cash equivalent securities toward equity securities 
see part i business history of the company physicians 
also  the rate used to discount mpl loss and lae reserves was reduced to from an average of around in  resulting in a reduction in discount accretion from forward 
as a result  investment income attributed to portfolio investing operations increased over due to less investment income having been allocated to mpl operations to cover discount accretion 
net of expenses  but before taxes  portfolio investing contributed million to pre tax operating income for compared to million during and million in realized investment gains accounted for nearly all the fluctuation between years  accompanied by the changes in investment income discussed above 
equity securities excluding gec  which is valued on an equity basis  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
equity securities are subject to changes in the stock market which may at times be volatile and cause pico s shareholders equity to fluctuate from period to period 
these equity securities  excluding gec  made up and of the company s investments  cash and cash equivalents at year ends and  respectively 
the breakdown of pre tax operating income from portfolio investing operations follows portfolio investing year ended december  in millions pre tax operating income pico and the professionals equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries other investment banking operating income equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents the company s share of gec s net income 
life and health insurance apl produced million in revenues during  million more than during the comparable period and  more than the breakdown of these revenues follows life and health insurance year ended december  in millions revenues net earned premiums investment income realized investment gains other income revenue from life and health insurance pre tax operating income pic apl the principal difference between and revenues  and operating income  was an increase in realized capital gains of million  principally attributable to the sale of apl s holdings of fairfield communities  inc common stock 
partially offsetting the increase in realized investment gains were a  decline in net earned premiums and a  reduction in investment income 
compared to  earned premiums were down million 
these reductions in net earned premiums were primarily due to apl no longer being the underwriting insurer for physicians employee health and dental plans  effective march  apl had ceased writing group health and dental coverages with the exception of physicians plans effective july  the following exhibit shows the impact of the decline in health insurance premiums upon net earned premiums over the past three years life and health insurance net earned premiums year ended december  in millions life insurance health insurance net earned premiums the exit from the group health insurance market primarily major medical was a result of management s decision to concentrate apl s marketing and sales efforts on the survivor key product line 
this life insurance product combines the benefits of a lump sum cash payout upon the diagnosis of certain critical illnesses with a death benefit 
gross written premiums for survivor key have increased from  in to  in and  in other revenues were down  compared to and  compared to this category includes apl s commission income for outside company products as well as its fees for administrative services contracts 
beginning january   apl ceased to be the agent of record on a block of group health business 
this decrease in commission revenue was directly offset by a corresponding reduction in commission expenses which is included with the insurance underwriting and other expenses line of the income statement 
investment income revenues were down  compared to and  compared to these decreases were principally due to an increased level of equity securities in apl s investment portfolio 
life and health operations resulted in pre tax operating income of million 
this compares to  in and million in as discussed above  realized investment gains were the primary source of the increase in income 
the decrease as compared to was primarily attributable to the exit from the group health insurance market 
apl s claims experience was excellent in the major medical product line in  which resulted in a reserve decrease for and contributed to the operating income 
property and casualty insurance sequoia  cic and cnic currently account for all of the ongoing property and casualty p c insurance revenues 
these companies write predominately light commercial and multiple peril insurance coverage in central and northern california 
because the merger occurred in november  only two months approximately worth of cic s and cnic s revenues  expenses  and operating income are included in these financial statements and in this discussion for no prior years data is shown for cic and cnic 
because sequoia was acquired on august   only five months of sequoia s financial information is included for  and none for total p c revenues for of million far exceeded partial year revenues of million 
sequoia produced million in revenues during as compared to million for last five months of  from the date of purchase of sequoia to year end 
as shown below  earned premiums made up most of these revenues 
premiums are earned pro rata throughout the year according to the coverage dates of the underlying policies 
included in the total p c revenues shown below are million from cic and cnic for the short period of their inclusion  including earned premiums of million  investment income of million  realized investment gains of  and other income of  property and casualty insurance year ended december  in millions revenues earned premiums sequoia earned premiums citation investment income realized investment gains other p c revenues pre tax operating income sequoia and citation sequoia s direct premium writings for were million  down million  or from the million reported by sequoia on a statutory basis for the full year of the million direct written premium total includes seven months of activity prior to physicians purchase of sequoia on august  this reduction in premium writings reflects the increased underwriting selectivity of sequoia s new management team 
as policies came up for renewal in and through much of  they were reviewed carefully by underwriting management for excessive loss experience and unwanted risks 
while new business writings have not offset renewal policies cancelled or non renewed  new policy writings have been better than expected 
the loss of renewal policies with higher loss ratios and greater exposures to risk should improve sequoia s loss ratios in the future 
sequoia produced a net loss of  for based upon statutory accounting practices sap as filed with the california department 
on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles gaap  sequoia reported net income of million compared to a million net loss for the five month period 
the primary difference between the sap net loss and gaap net income was attributable to the deferral of a portion of policy acquisition expenses  which will be amortized into expense pro rata as related premiums are earned 
much of sequoia s five month loss was attributable to expenditures which are expected to continue to provide benefits in future years through improved operating efficiencies 
these expenses included  among others  those associated with development of a new policy quoting and processing system and integrated claims processing and accounting systems 
software has been developed and is now in use which allows underwriters and agents to decentralize  rate policies in the field  and download the information via modem to the home office  allowing them to spend much more time in the field inspecting risks and servicing policies 
also contributing to the pre tax operating loss were acquisition costs such as commissions based upon written premiums  which were much higher than net earned premiums 
since the previous owner of sequoia took full responsibility for the unearned premium reserve at july   a considerable lag developed between sequoia s written premiums and earned premiums 
as a result  operating expenses were high compared to earned premiums 
normally  a portion of these acquisition expenses could have been deferred and expensed over the underlying policy periods 
however  this was not the case in for sequoia 
a large portion of these acquisition costs amounting to million were expensed in the year incurred instead of being deferred and amortized over the premium recognition period 
a write off of deferred acquisition costs is required when the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses  expected dividends to policyholders  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceed related unearned premiums 
the improvement in sequoia s performance is attributable to improved loss experience and reduced expenses 
as a result of improved loss and expense ratios  acquisition expenses have been capitalized and will be amortized over the premium recognition period  since a premium deficiency did not exist 
sequoia s industry ratios as determined under sap were as follows loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio statutory combined ratio amounts shown for and include periods prior to physicians ownership 
sequoia s gaap combined ratio was  consisting of a loss and lae ratio and an expense ratio of 
property and casualty operations contributed pre tax operating income of million during  consisting of million in revenues  less losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred of million and operating expenses of million 
this compares to pre tax operating loss of million 
mpl operations physicians and pro s mpl insurance business was sold to mutual on august  between july  and december   all mpl business written by physicians and pro was reinsured by mutual 
except for a few minor policy coverage extensions and adjustments which are reinsured by mutual  for all intents and purposes  the company ceased writing mpl policies effective january   the date mutual began writing the business directly 
the company continues to administer and adjust the remaining claims and lae reserves 
based upon careful analysis of various alternative scenarios for handling the runoff of the remaining claims reserves  the company determined that the best option was to process the existing claims internally with existing staff  rather than through a third party administrator or through an outright sale of the claims and lae reserves 
in addition  it is expected that shareholders equity will be better served by retaining the investments necessary to fund the payment of these claims and lae reserves  managing them along with the rest of the company s investment holdings  as opposed to selling of fully reinsuring these reserves and giving up the corresponding funds 
accordingly  although the company ceased writing mpl insurance  mpl is treated as a separate business segment of continuing operations due to the continued management of claims and associated investments 
revenues from mpl operations included the following medical professional liability insurance year ended december  in millions revenues earned premiums investment income  net of expenses income from sale of mpl business mpl revenues pre tax operating income since the withdrawal of physicians and pro from their personal automobile and homeowners lines of business in the late s  mpl has  for all intents and purposes  been these two companies only sources of insurance premiums 
the decline in earned premium from million in to million in and million in resulted from the withdrawal from the mpl line of business beginning with the percent quota share treaty with mutual effective with july  and subsequent new and renewal business 
the following table shows the decline in physicians and pro s direct written premiums over the past five years in millions direct written premiums this decline in direct written premiums indicative of the increasing competitive pressures within ohio which  among other factors  led physicians and pro to increase premium rates  to be more selective in underwriting and  ultimately  to withdraw from the mpl line of business 
mpl premiums continued to be earned during based upon premiums written prior to july   the effective date of the percent quota share treaty with mutual 
very few  if any  mpl premiums will be earned beyond investment income revenues will continue to accrue to the mpl runoff 
mpl operations produced pre tax operating income of million for compared to million and million in income during and  respectively 
pre tax operating results for were bolstered by a million take down of death  disability and retirement unearned premium reserves related to the mutual transaction  and loss and lae reserve reductions of approximately million as mpl reserves continued to develop favorably 
this favorable reserve development has been verified by two independent actuaries  as required by the ohio department regulations for mpl companies 
the million operating income recorded for was entirely attributable to the million realized on the sale of physicians and pro s mpl businesses 
the million recorded in benefited from more than million in reserve reductions  net of additional reserve discount accretion associated with reducing the reserve discount rate to from close to 
investment income was also higher in and due to greater reserve levels and higher loss reserve discount accretion in the greater amounts of discount resulted in corresponding allocations of investment income to these years for the mpl segment 
physicians claims department staff continues to process the runoff of the remaining mpl loss and loss adjustment expense claims which is progressing routinely 
at december   mpl reserves totaled million  net of reinsurance and discount 
this compares to million and million at december  and  respectively 
mpl loss and lae reserves continue to decline as a result the disposition of claims  accompanied by the continued favorable reserve development discussed above 
mpl insurance loss and lae reserves december  in millions direct reserves ceded reserves discount of net reserves net mpl reserves although mpl reserves are certified annually by two independent actuaries  as required by state law  significant fluctuations in reserve levels can occur based upon a number of variables used in actuarial projections of ultimate incurred losses and lae 
other operations other operations consists principally of summit s investment management operations  the wind down of raven development company s raven real estate development projects  and various other activities as summarized below other operations year ended december  in millions revenues real estate development investment management other revenue from other operations pre tax operating income real estate development investment management other pre tax operating income other operations investment management revenues and operating income from summit increased over summit now has more than million in assets under management 
summit s revenues increased over as a result of additional funds under management  including competitive portfolio management fees to the insurance companies 
however  intercompany fees have been eliminated in this presentation 
summit s pre tax operating income was  for this compares to a loss of  for  for a  improvement 
sales of real estate remained at about the same level in as in the previous two years 
during the first quarter of  consistent with raven s plan of orderly withdrawal from the real estate development business  management was successful in selling a large tract of undeveloped land  which represented most of raven s existing inventory 
raven now holds less than  in inventory of land for sale 
under the category of other  stonebridge partners ag stonebridge  a swiss corporation percent owned by physicians which brokers annuities and other insurance products within europe  produced a pre tax operating loss of million for the pre tax loss for was  stonebridge began operations in late  resulting in significant start up costs in  which continued into management believes that the stonebridge concept is a good one which fits well with the company s other businesses  however  for various reasons  stonebridge has been unsuccessful in marketing their brokerage business  as well as in collecting accounts which they believe are due them from clients 
management has recently taken steps to limit additional downside exposure 
additional operating losses will most likely be incurred in as a result of stonebridge 
liquidity and capital resources years ended december   and in  physicians took a significant step in changing its strategic direction by selling its ongoing mpl insurance business and related liability insurance business 
all assets and liabilities of physicians related to insurance policies written prior to the sale of the recurring book of business were retained by physicians 
during  physicians reactivated its investment advisory subsidiary  summit  acquired a california property and casualty insurance company  sequoia  and purchased of gec  a canadian corporation active in investment banking  agricultural services  water rights  and other businesses 
see item business history of the company 
in  physicians took another large step in the continuing process of changing its strategic direction  with the reverse acquisition of citation 
it is expected that each of the major companies currently within the pico group will be able to stand on its own and cover its own cash flow needs without the need for borrowing or additional capital infusions  with the possible exceptions of additional capital requirements of sequoia and cic to maintain or improve their ambest ratings or to meet minimum capital requirements 
as a result of ceasing to write mpl insurance  physicians operating cash flows have become  and should continue for the foreseeable future  to be negative 
cash flows from other sources within physicians  primarily reinsurance recoveries  investment income and the sale of invested assets will provide the necessary funds 
major cash outflows most likely will include the funding of claims and loss adjustment expenses  investment purchases  dividend distributions  and operating costs 
the company s active insurance p c subsidiaries  sequoia and cic  should provide positive cash flows from premium writings  investment income  and the sale of invested assets 
cash will be used to fund the payment of their own claims and operating expenses  as well as in purchasing investments 
summit should produce positive cash flow in the form of investment management fees in excess of operating costs 
although sequoia s positive operating cash flows exceeded more than million in  and cic s cash flows should become significant in and later years  physicians cash flows have had the greatest impact on the consolidated group during the past three years and should continue to do so for a number of years into the future 
as of december   physicians reported discounted unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of approximately million  net of reinsurance 
based upon projections from past actuarial information  more than  or million  of these reserves are expected to be settled by the end of the year past experience indicates that funding requirements should be greatest in the first through third years  accounting for more than of the total eventual reserve and loss adjustment expense payments 
as expected  loss and lae reserves at december  declined more than to million after payment of more than million in claims and lae 
operating expenses associated with the discontinued mpl line of business have been significantly reduced in and in and are expected to continue to decline 
as evidence of pico s cutbacks  employee counts have been reduced by nearly two thirds compared to the year end level 
the company s insurance subsidiaries attempt to structure the duration of their invested assets to match the cash flows required to settle the related unpaid claims liabilities 
their invested assets provide adequate liquidity to fund projected claims and lae payments for the coming years 
to the extent that funds necessary for settling claims and paying operating expenses are not provided by existing cash and cash equivalents  investment income  reinsurance recoveries  and rental other income  invested assets will be liquidated 
short term and fixed maturity investments are managed to mature according to projected cash flow needs 
equity securities will be converted to cash as additional funds are required  with an anticipated maximum liquidation lead time of approximately six months 
at december   physicians investment portfolio on a stand alone basis contained invested assets of approximately million  plus cash and cash equivalents of million 
these invested assets are in excess of the present value of expected future payouts of losses and loss adjustment expenses discounted at of million  even if million in investments in affiliates gec  sequoia  summit  pro  apl and other affiliates were excluded 
disregarding any appreciation or depreciation of physicians investment portfolio and the results of the operations of its subsidiaries and affiliates  on a stand alone basis physicians should experience a decline in total assets and total liabilities as a result of the payment of claims  loss adjustment expenses and operating expenses 
absent unfavorable loss experience and operating and other expenses in excess of investment income  shareholders equity should remain relatively unaffected 
income in excess of expenses  favorable claims experience  appreciation of investments and increases in the equities of subsidiaries and affiliates all would increase shareholders equity and  ultimately  total assets 
pico management hopes to maximize the return of all assets  including those needed to fund the eventual wrap up of the mpl reserves through  among other things  value investing and managing the invested assets internally rather than liquidating assets to pay a third party to oversee the runoff of the existing claims 
management also elected to handle the runoff of the mpl claims internally to continue to maintain a high standard of claims handling and to maximize shareholder values 
while management expects that the company s current and future investments will increase in value  offsetting some of the decline in assets during the period of runoff and increasing shareholder value  the impact of future market fluctuations on the value of the company s invested assets cannot be accurately predicted 
although assets will be managed to mature or liquidate according to expected payout projections  at times  in response to abnormal funding demands  some invested assets may need to be sold at inopportune times during periods of decline in the stock market or declines in the market values of the individual securities 
such forced sales are expected to occur infrequently and only under extreme circumstances  however  this cannot be guaranteed 
as previously mentioned  reinsurance recoveries reimbursement of covered losses from reinsurers will be a significant source of incoming funds in upcoming years as claims are settled 
as shown in the accompanying financial statements  consolidated reinsurance receivables amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  physicians reinsurance receivables were million at december  and million at december  of the million difference between the million consolidated total at december  and the million of physicians  million was recorded on sequoia s financial statements  most of which is due from src and guaranteed by qbe 
see item business history of the company 
of the remainder  million resulted from the inclusion of citation 
unsecured reinsurance risk is concentrated in the companies and amounts shown in the table under note reinsurance to the consolidated financial statements as of december  all companies listed are highly rated companies with significant sources of capital 
as an additional source of funding  pico s subsidiaries as they grow and accumulate increasing amounts of retained earnings may be able to return some of pico s investment in the form of dividend distributions  however  this cannot be assured 
on december   physicians paid a dividend of million to pico for further investment by pico 
this dividend was the maximum dividend that could be paid under ohio insurance regulations without specific approval by the ohio department 
state insurance departments do not regulate funds invested at the holding company level 
as shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  the company used cash flows of million for operations in and million in  compared to million in cash used for operations was greatly inflated by an approximate million increase in mpl reinsurance premiums as a result of significant changes in the company s reinsurance treaties 
the increased cash outflows for principally relate to a million reduction in mpl premium collections as compared to  increased claims payments of million  increased operating expenses of approximately million  increased federal income tax payments of  and increased deposits with reinsurers of million  partially offset by a million decrease in reinsurance cessions 
cash consumed by operations in decreased from the million level to million  even though mpl premium collections decreased by more than million and investment income receipts  excluding capital gains  decreased more than million 
partially offsetting the decline in mpl premiums  mpl claims payments decreased million during as compared to most of the remaining positive cash flow increase from operations was attributable to sequoia  not only due to its inclusion in the consolidation for the full year  but also as a result of reduced claims and expense payments and increased premiums

no dividends were eligible to be paid out of sequoia  cic or cnic as of january  in the past few years  the naic has developed risk based capital rbc measurements for both property and casualty and life insurers 
the measures provide the various state regulators with varying levels of authority based on the adequacy of an insurer s rbc

anything above ie two times authorized control level rbc required no further action on the part of the insurance company 
any company having results between and is classified as being at the company action level 
lower levels of rbc such as the regulatory action level to  the authorized control level to and the mandatory control level below require some form of insurance department action 
under the regulatory action level  the insurer must submit a plan as in the company action level 
the insurance commissioner will perform an examination or other analysis and  based upon such exam or analysis  issue a corrective order 
under the authorized control level  the same actions taken under the regulatory action level will occur

additional risk factors and uncertainties in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed in the preceding sections entitled business and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following risk factors are also inherent in the company s business operations integration of certain operations 
citation and physicians completed the merger with the expectation that the merger would result in certain benefits for the combined company 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part upon whether certain of the two companies business operations can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner 
there can be no assurance that this will occur or that cost savings in operations will be achieved 
the successful combination of the two companies will require  among other things  integration of the companies respective product offerings  medical management of health care claims and management information systems enhancements 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
the integration of certain operations following the merger will require the dedication of management resources which may temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of the combined companies 
there can be no assurance that integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
failure to effectively accomplish the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition following the merger 
dependence on key personnel 
the company has several key executive officers  the loss of whom could have a significant adverse effect on the company 
in particular  ronald langley  pico s chairman  and john r 
hart  pico s president and chief executive officer  play key roles in the company s and gec s investment decisions 
although neither officer is party to an employment agreement  they have entered into consulting agreements with pico and various of its subsidiaries 
messrs 
langley and hart are key to the implementation of the company s new strategic focus  and the ability of the company to implement its current strategy is dependent on its ability to retain the services of messrs 
langley and hart 
risks regarding physicians  continuing mpl liability 
in august  physicians sold its and pro s mpl insurance business and related liability insurance business 
physicians and pro retained all assets and liabilities related to insurance policies written prior to the sale of the recurring book of business 
physicians and pro will continue to administer claims and loss adjustment expenses under mpl insurance policies issued or renewed prior to july cash flow needed to fund the day to day operations and the payment of claims and claims expenses will be provided by investment income  lease income  and proceeds from the sale or maturity of securities 
physicians and pro have established reserves to cover losses and loss adjustment expense lae on claims incurred under the mpl policies issued or renewed to date 
the amounts established and to be established by physicians and pro for loss and lae reserves are estimates of future costs based on various assumptions and  in accordance with ohio law  have been discounted adjusted to reflect the time value of money 
these estimates are based on actual and industry experience and assumptions and projections as to claims frequency  severity and inflationary trends and settlement payments 
in accordance with ohio law  physicians and pro annually obtain a certification that their respective reserves for losses and lae are adequate from an independent actuary 
physicians and pro also obtain a concurring actuarial opinion 
physicians and pro s reserves for losses and lae for prior years developed favorably in  and these reserves were decreased by million in reserves also developed favorably in  however  accretion of reserve discount exceeded the amount of favorable development and retroactive reinsurance  resulting in a million increase in liabilities for prior years claims 
as a result of continued favorable claims experience  reserves for prior years claims were further reduced in the first and fourth quarters of management believes that the reserving methods and assumptions are reasonable and prudent and that physicians and pro s reserves for losses and lae are adequate 
due to the inherent uncertainties in the reserving process there is a risk  however  that physicians and pro s reserves for losses and lae could prove to be inadequate which could result in a decrease in earnings and shareholders equity 
adverse reserve development can reduce statutory surplus or otherwise limit the growth of such surplus 
under ohio law the statute of limitations is one year after the cause of action accrues 
also under ohio law there is a four year statutory time bar  however this has been construed judicially to be unconstitutional in situations where the plaintiff could not have reasonably discovered the injury in that four year period 
claims of minors must be brought within one year of the date of majority
