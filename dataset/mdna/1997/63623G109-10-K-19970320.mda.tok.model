in order to maintain its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to make substantial distributions to its stockholders 
the following factors  among others  will affect cash flow from operations and will influence the decisions of the board of directors regarding distributions i reduction in debt service resulting from the repayment of certain mortgage indebtedness relating to the golf courses  ii scheduled increases in base rent under the leases with respect to the golf courses  iii any payment to the company of percentage rent under the leases with respect to the golf courses  and iv returns from short term investments 
although the company receives most of its rental payments on a monthly basis  it has and intends to continue to pay distributions quarterly

future acquisitions will be made subject to the company s investment objectives and policies established to maximize both current income and long term growth in income 
the company s liquidity requirements with respect to future acquisitions may be reduced to the extent the company uses common stock or op units as consideration for such purchases

there were outstanding advances of million and million under this credit facility as of february  and december   respectively 
to replace the expiring credit facility  the company has obtained a commitment from a group of commercial banks for a million credit facility the new credit facility

funds from operations is considered by management as an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses  which management believes is more reflective of the value of real estate companies such as the company rather than a measure predicated on generally accepted accounting principles which gives effect to non cash expenditures such as depreciation 
funds from operations is generally defined as net income loss plus certain non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or as an alternative to cash flow  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  as a measure of liquidity 
the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit adopted revisions to the definition of funds from operations as set forth in the nareit white paper on funds from operations dated march the company has adopted the new definition of funds from operations and intends to present both the old and new definitions of funds from operations to assist in comparisons with prior periods of the company 
the primary difference between the old and new definitions of funds from operations is the exclusion from funds from operations of amortization of assets that are not uniquely significant to the real estate industry 
the funds from operations presented may not be comparable to funds from operations for other reits 
the following table summarizes the company s funds from operations  based on the old and new definitions  for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  in thousands net income    minority interest    depreciation and amortization    amortization restricted stock  amortization investment premiums gain on sale of property   write off of option payable discount on payoff of note payable funds from operations old definition    amortization restricted stock  amortization investment premiums amortization loan costs depreciation corporate funds from operations new definition    company s share of funds from operations company s funds from operations    in order to maintain its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to make distributions to its stockholders 
the company s distributions to stockholders have been less than the total funds from operations because the company is obligated to make certain payments with respect to principal debt and capital improvements 
management believes that to continue the company s growth  funds from operations in excess of distributions  principal reductions and capital improvement expenditures should be invested in assets expected to generate returns on investment to the company commensurate with the company s investment objectives and policies 
comparison of funds from operations for year ended december  to year ended december  funds from operations increased by  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in rent revenues of approximately  which was offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately  comparison of funds from operations for year ended december  to year ended december  funds from operations increased by  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in rent revenues of approximately  which was offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately  inflation all the leases of the golf courses provide for base and participating rent features 
all of such leases are triple net leases requiring the lessees to pay for all maintenance and repair  insurance  utilities and services  and  subject to certain limited exceptions  all real estate taxes  thereby minimizing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
seasonality although the results of operations of the company and its predecessors have not been significantly impacted by seasonality  the company generally expects that its results of operations may be adversely affected as a function of reduced payments of percentage rent in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to adverse weather conditions and the scheduled closure of golf courses located in harsh winter climates
