item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in an understanding of the company s financial position as of december  and  and its results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein contain additional information and should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
general since commencing operations in  the company s primary focus has been to explore for oil and gas primarily in the mid continent area utilizing d and high resolution d seismic technology 
the company believes that this focus has provided and will continue to provide the company with numerous exploratory prospects 
in addition  the company s business strategy has been enhanced by a shift in industry focus to international exploration and domestic development and acquisition activities  rather than domestic exploration activities 
by combining its advanced technologies with both proprietary and public data and successfully applying such technology to its exploration activities  the company has made new field discoveries since january  seven of which were made in during  the company initiated efforts in adding the louisiana gulf coast as a core area 
the company intends to apply the same concentrated area approach used by the company in oklahoma to the area in louisiana 
previous to  the company utilized shareholder contributions  cash flow from operations and  to a lesser extent  borrowings to fund its exploratory and other capital expenditure programs 
as a result of the company s expansion of its proprietary and other data bases  additions to the company s prospect inventory and acquisition plans and commitments  projected capital expenditures in will outpace management s estimate of internally generated cash flow from operations and existing working capital and will require additional external capital 
see capital expenditures  capital resources and liquidity 
management believes the company s involvement in a number of ancillary activities distinguishes the company from many of its competitors 
through the active marketing of the company s oil and gas production  management believes the company obtains prices that  on the whole  are more favorable than those received by its regional competitors 
the company also attempts to gain ownership of gathering  processing  transportation and saltwater disposal facilities when it believes such ownership can enhance net margins per boe 
the company also seeks to control costs by focusing the company s oil and gas operations in areas subject to less competitive pressure 
the cost of acquiring leasehold and mineral interests are generally lower in these areas 
the february acquisition of a domestic onshore drilling company further illustrates the company s involvement in ancillary activities and is expected to assist the company in controlling drilling costs 
each of these activities can improve the company s production economics and help to maximize wellhead margins 
the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to remain so in the future 
prices for oil and gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
in the future  lower oil and gas prices may reduce i the attractiveness or viability of exploration prospects and the amount of oil and gas reserves that may be produced economically  ii the company s cash flow from operations  iii the amount of outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facility and iv the company s net income and capital expenditures 
the company may from time to time enter into certain swap or hedge transactions in an attempt to mitigate such price volatility on production that is subject to market sensitive pricing 
to the extent the company is unable to effect such transactions  continued fluctuations in oil and gas prices could have an effect on the company s operating results 
the company had no hedge positions effecting results of operations for the year ended december  the company has entered into futures contracts to fix the sales price of certain of its oil and gas production during the company has entered into oil futures contracts for the months of january through august  with volumes ranging from  to  bbls per month  and prices ranging from per bbl in january to per bbl in august 
the company has also entered into gas futures contracts for the months of january through september  with volumes ranging from  to  mcf 
of gas per month and prices ranging from per mcf 
in january to per mcf 
in september 
these futures contracts are expected to mitigate the effect of lower product prices in the first quarter of as compared to december the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the units of production method based on the ratio of current production to total proved oil and gas reserves 
to the extent that such capitalized costs  net of depreciation  depletion and amortization  exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues  discounted at  from proved oil and gas reserves  after income tax effects  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date  even if oil or gas prices increase

during  the company expended the majority of the million of capital expenditures on exploration and production activity 
additionally  the company spent million for property acquisitions including million for producing properties and million for undeveloped leaseholds through the net acquisition of additional interests in the ames field 
during  net cash provided by financing activities rose to million as compared to million in this increase was due to borrowings under the credit facility during in  the amounts provided by financing activities primarily consisted of the proceeds of the july issuance of common stock after payment of debt 
capital expenditures 
the company s capital expenditures to date have focused primarily on the exploration  acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
the following table sets forth the company s expenditures for exploration  development and property acquisitions for each of the three years ended december  the table includes costs of oil and gas properties not subject to amortization  which consist of the cost of undeveloped leaseholds  wells in progress and secondary recovery projects before the assignment of proved reserves 
year ended december  in thousands exploration costs    development costs    property acquisition costs   total    during  the company financed its capital expenditures with cash flow provided by operations  borrowings under the company s credit facility and the remainder of the net proceeds from the company s july equity offering 
prior to the equity offering  the company financed its capital expenditures through shareholder contributions and borrowings under the credit facility 
the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures in it is currently anticipated that up to million of such amount will be used as follows i million in connection with the texaco acquisition  consisting of million for the acquisition of the wcbb assets  million for the purchase of the texaco claims and million for payments to the p a trust  ii million for the bonray acquisition  iii million for the workover and enhancement of certain rigs acquired in the bonray acquisition  and iv from million to million will be used to purchase shares of common stock of the new wrt energy in the rights offering  pursuant to the company s commitment in the wrt plan  if approved v and million for the purchase of additional claims against wrt energy 
as of march   approximately million had been expended by the company in connection with the foregoing activities 
also included in the company s budget is up to million for oil and gas exploration activities of which million is for exploratory wells and million is for development wells 
the aggregate level of capital expenditures in for drilling activities and the allocation thereof is highly dependent upon the company s success rate on exploration drilling and prevailing conditions in the oil and gas industry as well as the amount of common stock of the new wrt energy that the company is required to purchase in the rights offering 
accordingly  the actual level of capital expenditures and the allocation of such expenditures may vary materially from the above estimates 
capital resources 
prior to the july equity offering  the company s cash requirements had been met primarily through capital contributions from shareholders  cash generated from operations and borrowings under credit facilities 
as of december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility was structured as a revolving loan agreement providing for aggregate borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under the credit facility bore interest  at the banks prime  floating  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points or a pricing grid with the rate determined by the percentage of the borrowing base commitment outstanding 
principal payments on the credit facility were due at maturity in october  or when any amounts outstanding thereunder were in excess of the borrowing base 
interest payments were due quarterly 
the credit facility was collateralized by a mortgage on the company s producing and non producing oil and gas properties and contained restrictive covenants requiring  among other things  that the company i maintained specific levels of tangible net worth and working capital  ii met specific financial ratios and iii limit the payment of dividends or distributions to shareholders 
on march   the company established a new revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions  which  as amended  provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility were used to refinance indebtedness under the credit facility and to fund the texaco acquisition 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest is charged at the higher of the bank s prime rate plus basis points plus the applicable margin or the rate at which eurodollar deposits for one  two  three  six or twelve months are offered to the bank in the interbank eurodollar market plus the applicable margin 
loans made under the credit facility are payable in full on march  the maturity date 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and contains similar restrictive covenants to those described above relating to the credit facility 
as of march   outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were million 
liquidity 
the company intends to meet the remainder of its capital requirements and its other obligations primarily from existing cash balances  cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility 
the company s cash flow from operations will be dependent upon its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial and business conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
in addition  as a result of borrowings under the credit facility to fund the texaco acquisition  the company had million of available borrowing capacity under such facility 
management believes that additional financing will be required to fully implement its proposed capital budget and has commenced discussions with the lenders under the credit facility to increase the company s borrowing capacity thereunder to address it near term liquidity requirements 
the company also intends to seek additional capital through offerings of debt and or equity securities 
there can be no assurance  however  that the lenders will increase the borrowing limits under the credit facility or that such offerings can be successfully completed 
should sufficient financing not be available from these or other sources  implementation of the company s capital program would be delayed and  accordingly  the company s growth strategy could be adversely affected 
the company does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock in the near future 
earnings generated will be redeployed by the company as it continues its growth strategies 
in future periods  the company expects to recognize deferred income taxes of approximately to of income before income taxes 
the majority of the company s income tax expense is expected to be recognized as deferred income tax expense due to the current tax treatment of oil and gas exploration costs 
impact of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 
in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
is effective for certain transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities occurring after december  it is effective for other transfers of financial assets occurring after december  it is to be applied prospectively 
sfas no 
provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
it distinguishes transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
management of dlb does not expect that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on dlb s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
sop was adopted by dlb on january  it requires  among other things  that environmental remediation liabilities be accrued when the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  have been met 
sop also provides guidance with respect to the measurement of the remediation liabilities 
such accounting is consistent with dlb s current method of accounting for environmental remediation costs 
therefore  adoption of sop will not have a material impact on dlb s financial position or results of operations
