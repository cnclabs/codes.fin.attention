net cash provided by financing activities decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the ipo proceeds in funds from operations the company generally considers funds from operations ffo a widely used and appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit which provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
ffo as defined by nareit means income loss before minority interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company 
the company s method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo i does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  ii is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including its ability to make distributions and iii should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance 
ffo for the year ended december   increased to million compared to million for the comparable period in ffo amounts were calculated in accordance with nareit s definition of ffo as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands funds from operations calculation income before extraordinary item and minority interest 





















  adjustments add depreciation and amortization of real estate assets

  the definition of ffo does not permit the add back of amortization of loan costs  including amortization relating to buydown fees and interest rate caps 
the annual amortization related to these items is not a cash expense to the company  although it reduces ffo 
potomac mills and gurnee mills were refinanced in december under a fixed rate securitization 
accordingly  the related caps were sold and the amortization on such caps will not recur in the impact of these items on the company s historical effective interest rate and other relevant information is detailed below sawgrass mills has no interest rate hedging instruments dollars in thousands prior to refinancing franklin mills potomac mills gurnee mills loan amount

if libor is or above  the libor cap increases to economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  it has had little impact on the operation of the mills entities and the company during that period 
even in periods of higher inflation  however  tenant leases provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect the company 
as operating costs increase  leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to the tenants 
furthermore  most of the leases contain base rent steps and percentage rent clauses that provide additional rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
these provisions provide some protection to the company during highly inflationary periods
