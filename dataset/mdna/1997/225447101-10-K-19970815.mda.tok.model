see item  business  risk factors 
results of operations for the year ended june  fiscal  cree posted record revenue and net income of  and  or per share  respectively 
these results reflect an increase in revenue and net income of  and  respectively over the prior year 
product revenue  which includes led and wafer sales  module display products and real color displays  inc rcd moving message sign sales  reflect a increase over fiscal results 
comparatively  product revenue also increased during fiscal over amounts 
during fiscal  a significant portion of the rise in product revenue was directly attributable to higher blue light emitting diode led volume  which was prompted by the purchase agreement signed in september and amended in april  with siemens ag siemens 
that agreement and its amendment  provided sales in excess of million for fiscal as of june   the company has shipped all quantities required to be shipped by that date under the terms of the agreement 
the amendment to the purchase agreement provides for enhanced product specifications requested by siemens 
the specifications require that all leds be tested to meet a maximum rating for resistance to electrostatic discharge 
in exchange for the higher grade chip  siemens agreed to make non cancelable all shipments scheduled through september  shipments scheduled for october through december  may be canceled  subject to a cancellation fee 
as of june   approximately million chips remain to be shipped under the amended contract  of which million are subject to cancellation at siemen s option 
additionally  the amendment provides for higher prices per unit on items shipped early in the contract  with amounts being reduced as volume increases in the latter part of the contract 
the higher pricing  much of which has already been recognized in fiscal  was negotiated to offset increased per unit costs incurred during the third and fourth quarters of to meet enhanced specifications 
further reductions in per unit costs are required to provide a consistent profit margin on future sales and is expected from a combination of improvements made in the production process for yield  other processing efficiencies and the effective utilization of plant assets 
there can be no assurance that these efficiencies will be achieved 
under the amended contract  revenues received from siemens for shipments are also subject to certain foreign currency provisions  whereby siemens will receive discounts if the conversion rate of the german mark to the us dollar at the date of shipment has averaged or more for the preceding thirty days 
led sales also increased by in over amounts due to capacity and yield improvements made during that year 
the company is currently focusing on obtaining additional led customers who are interested in ordering commercial volumes of the product 
if the company is unable to expand its customer base  its revenue and earnings growth potential could be adversely impacted 
the company believes that in order to significantly grow market demand for the led product and defray competition  it must substantially lower prices 
to offer lower pricing to customers  the company must reduce unit costs of production 
the company is currently working on two projects which it expects will reduce the unit cost per chip 
the first is expected to reduce the size of each chip while continuing to use existing processes  thereby increasing the number of chips yielded per wafer 
the second initiative is expected to increase the overall wafer size to a two inch diameter structure 
this effort will also increase the yield per wafer  thus substantially lowering the overall cost of the led product 
the company s goal is to complete both of these projects during the first half of fiscal while the company s average sales price per unit for the led product in remained consistent with levels  the price is projected to fall during as the siemens amended purchase agreement includes a lower unit price in the second half of the contract 
in addition  if the company achieves increased volume from other customers a lower average sales price is expected 
if the company is unable to successfully manufacture the new chip structures described above  profits are anticipated to deteriorate during fiscal this situation would curtail market development and growth for the company s led business 
the anticipated reduction in the average sales price in is expected to be offset with greater led volume  assuming that the revised chip structure is successful 
in the middle and latter portion of fiscal  material wafer sales began to experience an improved pattern of orders as the worldwide research community is gaining a better acceptance of the sic technology  and the company continues to make improvements to the quality of its sic material 
accordingly  wafer sales volume increased approximately over levels 
in addition  the company was able to realize a slight increase in its average sales price due to the mix of premium wafer products with low defect levels that were more readily available during overall  wafer sales were higher than amounts 
during  the company expects to continue to supply wafers largely for research efforts  as customers have not yet proven the effectiveness of the product for commercial applications 
during fiscal  wafer sales grew or  over amounts  due to additional plant capacity installed during that year 
in july  the company announced development and supply agreements with a related party  c  inc c  to develop and supply bulk single crystal silicon carbide for gemstone applications 
pursuant to the development agreement  the company has undertaken a five year program directed to development of near colorless single crystalline for use in gemstones as a diamond substitute 
c will pay cree s direct costs of the development effort  plus a percentage margin on certain costs 
improved material resulting from the development program will be supplied to c under the supply agreement  which provides for prices based on cree s production costs plus a specified margin 
material purchased by c under the supply agreement may be used solely for the fabrication and sale of gemstones 
during fiscal and  the company sold material products to c those sales were at margins consistent with those achieved in connection with sales of similar products to the company s other customers 
financial results for the displays product line includes sales of both modules and sign products 
revenue for the modules business increased by in fiscal over prior year results due to increased volume as the product was introduced in fiscal moving message sign sales by rcd  the company s subsidiary  suffered a decline in revenue over amounts due to a decrease in volume 
this reduction was prompted by a long term strategic shift in focus of the company to the module product line  which has a longer sales lead time 
the moving message sign business relies heavily on distributor and small independent customers 
while the company continues to use its best efforts to market and sell moving message signs  the modules product line is considered to be a better fit for long term initiatives  as it requires fewer resources and aligns with the distribution network of other customer partners 
for fiscal  the company has reduced the number of standard product offerings in both of these businesses and will concentrate on increasing sales of these standard products 
the average sales prices from both products remained consistent with levels 
revenue for the displays business grew or  during fiscal from amounts due to the introduction of the modules line of business during that year 
research contract revenue increased to  during and in fiscal from amounts 
higher revenues were generated as a result of more funding being made available from the us government for certain research contracts  primarily in the areas of microwave  blue laser and basic material development 
also  additional plant capacity in both years have enabled more research to be performed by the company 
included in revenue for fiscal  is a one time license fee of  this license fee was earned pursuant to a license and technology transfer agreement entered into in september with shin etsu handotai co 
ltd 
shin etsu 
pursuant to this agreement  the company granted shin etsu a license to use certain epitaxial and device fabrication process technology for the manufacture of the company s led product 
the license fee is payable in installments  with all funds collected as of june   with the exception of a  payment due on june  the company also recorded an accrued expense of  payable in june to a third party that brokered the agreement 
results for fiscal include a one time net license fee revenue of  this license fee was earned pursuant to a development license and supply agreement entered in october with siemens  in which the company granted siemens a license to use certain technology to manufacture blue and green led products 
these license agreements were entered into to allow the company to increase interest in the gan on sic materials technology used in its leds in both europe and asia 
in addition  if the licensed technology is put into commercial production by these corporate partners  it is anticipated that they will continue to purchase sic wafer materials from the company  although there is no contractual requirement to do so 
as of august  siemens and shin etsu have not begun commercial production using the licensed technology 
the company s gross margin increased to  or of revenue for fiscal the company s gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in and respectively 
license fee revenue  which has no corresponding cost  is included in both and results 
without license fees  gross margins would have been  or of revenue for fiscal and  or of revenue for the comparative period in the overall increase in margin in stems from higher throughput  which more effectively utilized plant capacity  and yield efficiencies on led and wafer products  which lowered the cost of production per unit 
while the company has demonstrated a lower per unit cost during  much of the success was due to higher volumes processed relating to the siemens purchase agreement 
this greater throughput enabled the company to spread fixed cost investments over a larger volume of product 
higher margins in the future are largely contingent on the company s ability to increase the volume of leds produced  by gaining a larger customer base and by the successful application of the research and development projects 
in addition  as a result of the anticipated decline in the average sales price to be received in  to maintain competitive margins  the company must also enhance its chip structure to allow for smaller chips and larger wafers 
if the company is unable to improve efficiency under the new chip standards or gain orders for additional volume  gross margin could be negatively impacted 
gross margin deteriorated in from levels  due to disappointing manufacturing yields and insufficient utilization of the significant investments made in additional plant capacity 
the company benefits from research and development efforts sponsored by us government contracts  corporate sponsors and internal funding 
contracts are awarded to the company to fund both short term and long term research projects 
funding for projects with near term applications for the company typically include a cost share component that the company is responsible for absorbing 
projects that may not have available production applications or require longer term development are usually awarded on a cost plus basis with built in margins exceeding 
during fiscal  the company changed its policy for reporting government contract activity 
reporting is now based on the nature of the contract 
for contracts under which the company anticipates that funding will exceed direct costs  all funding is reported as revenue and direct costs are reported as cost of revenues 
for contracts under which the company anticipates that direct costs will exceed funding  costs are reflected as research and development expenses with the related funding amounts offsetting these costs 
research and development costs have increased by to  in due to substantial work performed on two cost share contracts to further the blue laser research 
net costs to the company for these projects were  and  for and  respectively 
both of these cost share contracts will conclude during the first half of additionally  research and development costs for  include a one time write off of  for the closure of the company s eastern european division 
the eastern european division  located in st 
petersburg  russia  was a research group performing some of the company s basic material and device development work 
sales and general and administrative expenses increased to  for the period ended june   compared to due to overall cost increases to support the growth of the company 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs have decreased to in from and in and  respectively 
increased costs include recruiting and salary expenses for additional sales personnel to focus the business on gaining new led customers  the brokerage fee a net present value of  associated with generating license fee revenue and greater legal fees in connection with the defense of the pending securities class action lawsuit see part i  item 
the company anticipates that sales and general and administrative expenses may continue to rise in future periods as it expands sales efforts and as a result of the pending litigation 
other income expense includes a net  one time charge associated with disposal costs for fixed assets and expenses arising from abandoned patent applications 
this amount was partially offset by proceeds received from an insurance settlement for lost profits associated from a temporary plant shut down that was caused by a natural disaster 
net interest income decreased by  in over results and increased by  when comparing to  due to higher investable cash balances available in fiscal the company concluded a private equity placement in september  that increased available cash in during  the company s effective tax rate was 
the rate was lowered from statutory levels due to the utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
the tax provision consists primarily of japanese foreign tax withholdings on license fee income 
the company anticipates that the effective tax rate will increase substantially in fiscal since the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards will not offset as high a percentage of projected pre tax book income 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations reached a record  in compared with cash used in operations of  and  in and  respectively 
this increase was driven primarily from profitability 
the increase in cash used in over amounts was caused by a significant increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances 
if the company achieves its goal of increasing customer demand and implements the two research and development projects related to reducing production costs  the company expects that cash provided by operations will increase in and will be sufficient to fund all anticipated capital additions required 
the number of trade average days sales outstanding was reduced to for from and days experienced in and  respectively  due to a focused collections effort put forth during the year 
the company invested  in capital equipment during compared to  and  spent during and  respectively 
much of the plant capacity additions were made in the crystal growth and epitaxial departments 
at this time  the company anticipates additions in to be at a similar level to amounts spent in and intends to fund these additions through cash provided by operations and cash on hand 
during  a significant investment was made for equipment related to the production of the led and wafer products 
additional investments were also made in the crystal growth and wafer processing areas 
financing activities provided the company  during fiscal the majority of the funding was provided by the september private placement which yielded approximately million 
outlook issues and uncertainties cree does not provide a forecast for future financial performance 
while management is optimistic about the company s short and long term prospects  the issues and uncertainties  described in part i  item  business  risk factors  should be considered in evaluating its growth outlook
