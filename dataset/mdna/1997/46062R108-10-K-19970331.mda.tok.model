item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
certain of the matters discussed herein may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and as such may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of interpool to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
general the company generates revenues through leasing transportation equipment  primarily dry cargo containers and container chassis 
most of the company s revenues are derived from payments under operating leases and income earned under finance leases  under which the lessee has the right to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
revenue derived from an operating lease generally consists of the total lease payment from the customer 
in  and  revenues derived from operating leases were million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues  respectively 
revenue derived from a direct finance lease consists only of income recognized over the term of the lease using the effective interest method 
the principal component of the direct finance payment is reflected as a reduction to the net investment in the direct finance lease 
in  and  total payments from direct finance leases were million  million and million  respectively 
the revenue component of total lease payments totalled million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
the company s mix of operating and direct finance leases is a function of customer preference and demand and the company s success in meeting those customer requirements 
during the initial two years of either an operating lease or a direct finance lease the contribution to the company s earnings before interest and taxes is very similar 
in subsequent periods  however  the operating lease will generally be more profitable than a direct finance lease  primarily due to the return of principal inherent in a direct finance lease 
however  after the long term portion and any renewal of an operating lease expires  the operating lease will have redeployment costs and related risks which are avoided under a direct finance lease 
the company conducts business with shipping line customers throughout the world and is thus subject to the risks of operating in disparate political and economic conditions 
offsetting this risk is the worldwide nature of the shipping business and the ability of the company s shipping line customers to shift their operations from areas of unfavorable political and or economic conditions to more promising areas 
substantially all of the company s revenues are billed and paid in us dollars 
in addition  the company s container purchases are paid for in us dollars 
the company believes these factors substantially mitigate foreign currency rate risks 
the company s container leasing operations are conducted through interpool limited  a barbados corporation 
the company s effective tax rate benefits substantially from the application of an income tax convention  pursuant to which the profits of interpool limited from container leasing operations are exempt from federal taxation in the united states 
such profits are subject to barbados tax at rates which are significantly lower than the applicable rates in the united states 
see united states federal income tax 
the company s chassis leasing operations are conducted primarily through trac lease 
certain other united states equipment leasing activities are conducted through interpool itself 
in march   the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
earnings per share which is effective for fiscal this statement establishes accounting standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
it also requires dual presentation of basic eps and diluted eps for companies with complex capital structures 
for  on a pro forma basis basic net income per share would have been and diluted net income per share would have been under the new standard

liquidity and capital resources the company uses funds from various sources to finance the acquisition of equipment for lease to customers 
the primary funding sources are cash provided by operations and borrowings  generally from banks  the issuance of capital lease obligations and the sale of the company s debt securities 
in addition  the company generates cash from the sale of equipment being retired from the company s fleet 
in general  interpool seeks to meet debt service requirements from the leasing revenue generated by its equipment

the capital securities represent preferred beneficial interests in the trust s assets 
distributions on the capital securities are cumulative and payable at the annual rate of of the liquidation amount  quarterly in arrears  commencing february  the company has the option to defer payment of distributions for an extension period of up to five years if it is in compliance with the terms of the capital securities 
interest at will accrue on such deferred distributions throughout the extension period 
the capital securities will be subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the debentures to the trust 
the redemption price decreases from of the liquidation preference in to in and thereafter 
under certain limited circumstances  the company may  at its option  prepay the debentures and redeem the capital securities prior to at a prepayment price specified in the governing instruments

united states federal income tax commencing with its year ended december   the company has been subject to federal and state income taxes as a subchapter c corporation under the internal revenue code of the company  trac lease  inc and other united states subsidiaries file a consolidated united states federal income tax return 
this consolidated group is liable for federal income taxes on its worldwide income 
personal holding company issues 
if the company or any of its subsidiaries were classified as a personal holding company  such corporation s undistributed personal holding company income would be subject to a federal income tax of in addition to its regular federal income tax liability 
the federal income tax laws have two requirements for classifying a company as a personal holding company 
the company and its subsidiaries currently satisfy the first requirement  the ownership of more than of the value of the company s stock by five or fewer individuals 
whether or not the company or any of its subsidiaries satisfies the second requirement  that at least of such corporation s adjusted ordinary gross income constitutes personal holding company income  will depend upon such corporation s income mix 
based upon current projections  management does not believe the company s income mix will satisfy the second requirement  accordingly  the company should not be classified as a personal holding company 
although the income mix of one or more of the company s subsidiaries might satisfy the second requirement  causing any such corporation to be classified as a personal holding company unless it were also a foreign personal holding company  in which case it would be subject to the foreign personal holding company rules described below  management does not believe that any subsidiary will be liable for personal holding company tax 
if any of the company s subsidiaries were deemed to be a personal holding company  management anticipates that such corporation would distribute a sufficient amount of its earnings to eliminate any undistributed personal holding company income 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not at some point in the future be liable for the personal holding company tax 
commencing in  a publicly held corporation may not  subject to limited exceptions  deduct for federal income tax purposes certain compensation paid to an executive in excess of million in any taxable year the million cap 
compensation attributable to the exercise of options granted after february  could be counted in determining whether the million cap has been exceeded in any taxable year 
whether the million cap with respect to an executive will be exceeded  and whether the company s deductions for compensation paid in excess of the million cap will be denied  will depend upon the resolution of various factual and legal issues that cannot be resolved at this time 
however  the company intends to endeavor to comply with the rules governing the million cap so that it will not be subject to limitation under such rules 
trac lease 
trac lease has approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  which may be used only to offset the income of trac lease and  if not utilized  will expire between and the use of substantially all these loss carryforwards is subject to a number of limitations under federal tax laws 
interpool limited 
under certain circumstances  the company may be liable for united states federal income taxes on earnings of interpool limited and any other foreign subsidiaries of the company  whether or not such earnings are distributed to the company 
this would occur if interpool limited realized subpart f income as defined in the code  if it were deemed to be a foreign personal holding company or a passive foreign investment company  if it were to have an increase in earnings invested in united states property or if it were considered to have excess passive assets 
subpart f income includes foreign personal holding company income  such as dividends  interest and rents 
although a substantial portion of interpool limited s income consists of rents from container leasing activities  the company believes that such rents are not subpart f income because they are derived from the active conduct of a trade or business and received from unrelated persons 
however  interpool limited has received some dividend and interest income in and  which will be taxed as subpart f income 
if interpool limited were treated as a foreign personal holding company for any year  the company would be taxed on the amount the company would have received if interpool limited had distributed all its income to the company as a dividend 
one of the conditions for treating a foreign subsidiary as a foreign personal holding company is that a minimum of of the foreign subsidiary s gross income must be foreign personal holding company income 
foreign personal holding company income does not include rental income that constitutes at least of the subsidiary s gross income 
because the company expects that rental income will constitute at least of interpool limited s gross income  the company does not anticipate that interpool limited will be deemed a foreign personal holding company 
a foreign corporation such as interpool limited is a passive foreign investment company if or more of its gross income is foreign personal holding company income or the average percentage of assets by value held by such corporation during the taxable year which produce foreign personal holding company income is at least 
the company does not believe that interpool limited is a passive foreign investment company 
if interpool limited were to become a passive foreign investment company  the company would make the election to treat interpool limited as a qualified electing fund with the result that the company would be taxed each year on interpool limited s entire earnings 
a parent company is also subject to taxation when a foreign subsidiary increases the amount of its earnings invested in united states property during any calendar year 
the company does not expect that interpool limited will invest any earnings in united states property 
the revenue reconciliation act of added a new type of shareholder income inclusion where a foreign subsidiary has its post december  earnings invested in excess passive assets 
because the company believes that more than of the adjusted basis of interpool limited s assets will constitute assets used in the active conduct of a trade or business generating income from unrelated persons  rather than passive assets  the company does not expect that the provisions dealing with excess passive assets will apply 
the small business job protection act of repealed the income inclusion for years after united states barbados income tax convention 
interpool limited s business is managed and controlled in barbados  it also has a permanent establishment in the united states 
under the tax convention  any profits of interpool limited from leasing of containers used in international trade generally are taxable only in barbados and not in the united states 
for its taxable years commencing prior to january   interpool limited is entitled to the benefits of the tax convention for each year that more than of the shares of interpool limited are owned  directly or indirectly  by united states citizens or residents the stock ownership test and its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to meet liabilities to persons who are not residents or citizens of the united states the base erosion test 
the company believes that interpool limited passes both of these tests and should continue to be eligible for the benefits of the tax convention  but there can be no assurance as to such continued eligibility 
if interpool limited ceased to be eligible for the benefits of the tax convention  a substantial portion of its income would become subject to the united states federal income tax and the branch profits tax 
a protocol to the tax convention has been ratified by the united states and barbados which amends the eligibility provision of the tax convention  making the stock ownership test easier to satisfy and the base erosion test more difficult to satisfy 
the protocol became effective on january  and applies to taxable years of interpool limited commencing on or after that date 
the company believes that interpool limited will continue to satisfy the base erosion test and remain eligible for the benefits of the tax convention after neither the tax convention nor the protocol affords interpool limited any relief from the personal holding company tax or the accumulated earnings tax 
to the extent that interpool limited has united states source income that is personal holding company income or is not needed in its business  interpool limited could be taxed on such income unless such income is distributed to the company as a dividend 
the company expects that interpool limited would distribute any such income to the company 
state and local taxes income taxes 
the company and trac lease are liable for state and local income taxes on their income  and interpool limited is liable for state and local income taxes on its earnings attributable to operations in the united states 
sales tax 
to date  interpool limited and trac lease generally have not paid sales taxes on their leasing revenues to the states in which they conduct business because management has believed such revenues to be exempt from state sales taxes on several grounds  including a long standing interpretation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution that would prohibit the imposition of a tax on cargo containers and chassis used primarily for transportation of goods in interstate commerce or international trade 
recently  itel containers international corp 
itel  a container leasing company  challenged an attempt by the state of tennessee to collect sales tax on itel s proceeds from the leasing of containers delivered in tennessee 
in a ruling by the united states supreme court in february  itel s position was rejected and the court upheld the right of tennessee to impose sales tax on leasing revenues from containers delivered in tennessee 
the company cannot predict the extent to which states other than tennessee will now attempt to collect sales tax on the company s equipment leasing revenues based on this supreme court decision 
under the terms of the company s equipment leases  the company would be entitled to pass any such sales tax on to its lessees 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the past  the effects of inflation on administrative and operating expenses have been largely offset through economies of scale achieved through expansion of the business
