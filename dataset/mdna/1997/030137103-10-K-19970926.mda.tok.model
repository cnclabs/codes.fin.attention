demand for the registrant s thin film products was also strong 
sales of thin film products increased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year the substantial increase in demand for the registrant s products exposed and exacerbated pre existing problems in the registrant s manufacturing processes 
these problems negatively impacted product yields which  in turn  resulted in higher material  labor and overhead costs
