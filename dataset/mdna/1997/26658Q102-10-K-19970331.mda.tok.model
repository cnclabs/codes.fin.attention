seasonality seasonality generally does not affect the company s waste treatment technology operations  however  it does have an effect on the company s technical support services business 
a large component of the company s staff augmentation business is devoted to nuclear power plant outage support 
the seasonal nature of this work is caused by utilities desire to schedule their nuclear unit refueling and maintenance outages during spring and fall when  due to moderate temperatures  electrical load demand is lowest 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s computer and communications consulting services client base is in the federal  state and local government sectors 
funding appropriations for many of these clients projects are coordinated with the government s fiscal years which causes some season impact on this business

cautionary information regarding forward looking statements in response to the safe harbor provisions contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is including in this annual report on form k the following cautionary statements which are intended to identify certain important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company 
many of these factors have been discussed in prior filings with the securities and exchange commission  including the discussion of risk factors contained in the company s registration statement on form s file no 
which became effective on april   to which reference is hereby made 
the company experienced growth in total revenues during as compared to in addition  net income in was significantly greater than in however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain these favorable operating trends in future periods 
the company s future operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as the acceptance and implementation of its waste treatment technologies  particularly vitrification and thermal desorption  in the governmental and commercial sectors  the evaluation by doe and other customers of the company s technologies versus other competing technologies as well as conventional storage and disposal alternatives  the timing of new waste treatment projects  including those pursued jointly with bnfl  and the company s ability to maintain existing collaborative relationships or enter into new collaborative arrangements in order to commercialize its waste treatment technologies 
in addition  the company s future operating results are largely dependent upon the timing and awarding of future contracts by the doe for the cleanup of the waste sites administered by it 
the timing and award of such contracts by the doe is directly related to the response of governmental authorities to public concern over the treatment and disposal of radioactive  hazardous  mixed and other waste 
the lessening of public concern in this area or other changes in the political environment could adversely affect the availability and timing of government funding for the cleanup of doe and other sites containing radioactive and mixed wastes 
additionally  revenues from technical support services have in the past and continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues  and the loss of one or more technical support service contracts could adversely affect the company s future operating results
