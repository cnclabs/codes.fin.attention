current trends in the domestic operator services industry continue to show weakness as discussed more fully in the prior year s analysis below and as reflected in a decrease in such revenues from approximately  of revenues in to approximately  of revenues in because of this historical and anticipated future trend  the company continued its planned revenue shift by developing and acquiring revenue sources from product lines other than domestic operator services 
during  development of the coin operations continued and this service produced revenues of  in contrast with insignificant revenues during in addition  revenues from acquisitions  described under acquisitions below  offset declines in revenues from domestic operator services as follows i revenues for the six months of cnsi s operations were approximately  ii nbe revenues for the three months of operations in were approximately  and iii revenues from the  pay phones purchased in the november coastal telecom garden state bek tel acquisition were approximately  in addition  revenues from other business lines increased as follows i crescent had revenues of  in compared to  during the three months of operations included in  ii ahe had revenues of  in compared with  in  and iii long distance revenues were  in compared to  in cost of sales  as a percentage of revenues  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is attributable for the most part to reduced bad debts  collection costs and operator center costs 
for  there was decrease in the cost of bad debts and collections due to a shift to the customer of the burden of bad debt risk and a decrease in operator center costs primarily due to synergies of combining the operations of the two operator centers of cnsi and anei 
in addition  the decrease reflects the company s reduced dependence on domestic operator service revenues and relatively high costs associated therewith

the total number of calls processed increased by in to  while the minutes billed increased by to  in revenues did not increase correspondingly since the increase in calls and minutes related to calls which have lower rates than calls

network costs increased  as a percentage of revenues  from to between and commission expenses decreased as a result of the company s shifting into new higher profit margin services for which commissions  as a percentage of revenue  are lower  as well as due to the renegotiation of unprofitable customer commission agreements 
network expense increased due to an increase in fixed network costs resulting from a slight increase in fixed network cost rates and the expansion of the coin fixed network
