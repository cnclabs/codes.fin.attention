item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview acx technologies  inc the company  together with its subsidiaries  is a diversified  value added manufacturing organization focused on pioneering differentiated customer solutions 
two business segments comprise the majority of the company s results from operations the packaging business  operated through graphic packaging corporation graphic packaging and the ceramics business  operated through coors ceramics company coors ceramics 
graphic packaging manufactures both folding carton and flexible packages and participates in the beverage  detergent  cereal  tobacco  pet food  confection and personal care markets 
coors ceramics manufactures structural ceramics  electronic ceramic components and advanced electronic ceramic packages for the telecommunications  semiconductor  power generation  petrochemical  automotive and pulp and paper industries  along with numerous others 
in addition to the primary operating businesses  the company owns technology based developmental businesses operated through golden technologies company  inc golden technologies 
golden technologies focus is on assembling and distributing solar electric systems  developing biodegradable plastics and marketing a health food ingredient 
the solar electric systems business was enhanced by golden technologies november acquisition of a controlling interest in photocomm  inc photocomm  a publicly traded company nasdaq pcom 
additionally  the historical results for the developmental businesses include its interest as the general partner of a real estate development partnership and the operations of a corn wet milling facility that produced high fructose corn syrup and refined corn starch 
the company has recently decided to exit the high fructose corn syrup business amid rising corn costs and excess high fructose corn syrup supply 
this financial review presents the company s operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and its financial condition at december  and this review should be read in connection with the information presented in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
discontinued operations in  the board of directors adopted a plan to dispose of the company s aluminum rigid container sheet business operated by golden aluminum company golden aluminum 
in conjunction with this decision  the company recorded pretax charges of million for anticipated losses for the sale and estimated operating losses of the business through the disposition date 
on march   the sale of golden aluminum was completed for million  million of which was received at closing and million is due within two years 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  the purchaser has the right to return golden aluminum to the company during the two year period rather than pay the million obligation 
the initial payment of million is non refundable 
the historical operating results and the estimated loss on the sale of this business have been segregated as discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statement of income for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of golden aluminum which were held for sale at december  have been separately identified on the december  consolidated balance sheet as net current or noncurrent assets of discontinued operations 
the consolidated balance sheet as of december  has not been restated 
discontinued operations have not been segregated on the consolidated statement of cash flows and therefore  includes sources and uses of cash for golden aluminum 
results from continuing operations consolidated net sales for were million  an increase of million or over net sales for of million increased over net sales of million 
the company s sales growth benefited from acquisitions by graphic packaging in mid and in march of coors ceramics sales also grew  primarily due to internally generated sales opportunities 
net sales to coors brewing company coors brewing consisted of packaging products and refined corn starch and comprised  and  of  and total revenues  respectively 
the company continues to pursue new markets and customers in an effort to be less dependent upon coors brewing 
international sales to western european and canadian markets in and were and of net sales  respectively 
in  these sales accounted for of consolidated net sales and were principally to western european markets 
future years sales growth is expected to be solid in both the packaging and ceramics businesses  fostered by the pursuit of niche acquisitions  additional base business revenues and by building strong relationships with existing customers for their future needs 
the developmental businesses are expected to experience a significant decline in sales due to the decision to exit the high fructose corn syrup business  although this decline will be offset in part by the fourth quarter acquisition of a controlling interest in photocomm 
operating income from continuing operations by segment in millions coors ceramics graphic packaging golden technologies before asset impairment and restructuring charges corporate operating income before golden technologies charges golden technologies asset impairment and restructuring charges operating income after charges consolidated operating income for included million in asset impairment and restructuring charges related to the elimination of non strategic operations at golden technologies versus million in restructuring charges reported in the asset impairment charges of million were taken primarily to reflect the impact of unfavorable market conditions for high fructose corn syrup and the company s inability at this time to demonstrate the commercial viability of its cadmium telluride solar panel production process 
the restructuring charges of million consist primarily of severance charges and pertain to a reorganization of administrative functions at golden technologies and management realignments in the solar energy distribution business 
excluding these charges  operating income grew million in to million  primarily attributable to graphic packaging s folding carton facility acquisition 
the comparable increase in operating income in over was million or to million 
coors ceramics led this increase through additional sales with relatively few additional fixed costs 
graphic packaging s contribution to the increase was primarily attributable to the full year inclusion of the flexible packaging acquisition that occurred in mid consolidated gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales was  and for  and  respectively 
gross margin improved at graphic packaging during both and due to increased sales volumes  productivity gains  shop floor improvements and the acquisitions 
coors ceramics telecommunication and semiconductor business contributed to the gross margin improvement while downturns in these same businesses in the following year reduced overall margins for marketing  general and administrative expenses for  and were million  million and million  which represented  and of net sales  respectively 
research and development costs decreased million to million in after having increased million between and changes in research and development expenses are attributable primarily to changes in activity levels at golden technologies 
during  additional expenses were incurred in developing photovoltaic panels and biodegradable polymer technologies while the decrease was related to the decision to exit certain non strategic ceramic research projects 
ongoing research and development efforts at golden technologies will be directed primarily toward the biodegradable polymer technologies 
interest expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in pertains to reduced borrowing costs associated with the committed bank facility and fewer short term borrowings during the year 
the increase was due to higher interest rates associated with the transition from short term borrowings to long term debt 
the consolidated effective tax rate for the company in was compared to in and in contributing to the higher tax rate for was a lower earnings base which increased the impact of the company s non deductible items 
in addition  no tax benefit was taken for built in losses on an entity experiencing tax losses and for capital losses that may not be deductible due to a lack of offsetting capital gains 
the company anticipates that non deductible goodwill associated with acquisitions will produce an ongoing effective tax rate of approximately 
as a result of the asset impairment and restructuring charges discussed above  consolidated income from continuing operations declined million to million in excluding these charges for both years  income from continuing operations was million or per share while income from continuing operations was million or per share 
coors ceramics coors ceramics net sales for increased million to million over net sales of million 
this increase was achieved despite the loss of more than million in revenues in the telecommunications industry and the loss of over million in revenues from the semiconductor and data processing industries 
increases in these industries between and helped drive coors ceramics sales growth of 
offsetting the declines in semiconductor processing and telecommunications sales were increased volumes for power tubes  beverage valves  precipitators and pulp and paper industry products 
although customers continue to seek price reductions  coors ceramics competes primarily on quality and thus volume  not price  has been the primary catalyst behind the changes in sales dollars 
international sales continued to prosper and comprised of total sales in  in and in during  structural products contributed of coors ceramics sales  up from in and in electronic products and advanced ceramic electronic packages  which comprise the remainder of sales  declined as a percentage of total sales  primarily due to the severe decline in the volume of advanced ceramic electronic packages sold to the telecommunications industry 
coors ceramics operating income for declined million  or  when compared to the record setting operating income of million reported in the results improved million or over the million recorded in operating margins were in  down from in  which were improved over operating margins of 
operating results for turned downward in correlation with the telecommunications and semiconductor processing industries 
the declines were offset in part by stronger margins in the petrochemical and pulp and paper industry 
as applications for ceramic materials continue to increase  coors ceramics believes its commitment to uncompromising quality and its focus on new ceramic materials and synergistic acquisitions will propel it squarely into the next century 
the outlook for coors ceramics is in part dependent upon the turnaround expected in mid to late in the telecommunications and semiconductor processing industries 
graphic packaging graphic packaging s net sales for were million  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million 
net sales for increased over net sales of million 
acquisitions in mid and at the beginning of accounted for a significant portion of the increases reported in both periods 
the acquisition contributed million in revenues while the mid acquisition provided approximately million in incremental revenues because of the full year inclusion of this acquisition in operations for the remaining improvement related to higher sales prices in the folding carton division primarily due to higher raw materials prices which are generally passed along to customers 
sales to coors brewing were approximately  and of graphic packaging s net sales for  and  respectively 
the acquisitions have enhanced graphic packaging s customer base thereby reducing its dependence upon coors brewing 
in addition  the acquisitions have expanded graphic packaging s geographic reach  especially into canadian markets  which were approximately of net sales 
in  and  folding carton sales accounted for  and  respectively  with flexible sales accounting for the balance of the business 
net folding carton sales were million in  an increase of million over net sales of million in excluding the effect of the acquisition  folding carton net sales were down million related primarily to volume declines in folding carton sales to the beverage industry  offset in part by increased volumes for specialty packaging to the cereal markets and the fast service restaurant industry and added sales of composicups 
flexible packaging sales for declined million to million due to a combination of i lower volumes in the snack food business  ii the elimination of less profitable extruded film business in  iii lower raw material costs passed through to customers in the form of lower prices  and iv customer initiated packaging specification changes that reduce total package cost 
graphic packaging posted superior growth in operating income  which rose million or to million over when operating income was million 
results reflected an increase of million when compared to operating income of million 
improvements in were generated by a combination of increased shop floor efficiencies  the acquisition which contributed million in operating income and a favorable product mix with higher margins 
in addition  the elimination of certain extruded film business contributed to a more favorable product mix in the flexible packaging division and improved operating margins for this division when compared to the improvement over related principally to the mid acquisition and the resultant synergies realized from that acquisition 
the acquisition contributed million of operating income in while the six month contribution was million 
operating margins were  and in  and  respectively 
this trend reflects graphic packaging s focus on high margin  value added products  improved performances at the acquired facilities  and the benefit of synergies realized subsequent to the acquisitions 
graphic packaging continues to focus on commercializing new products and processes to serve existing and new markets  and to pursue niche acquisitions that complement its existing business 
graphic packaging believes its strategy of being a niche packaging provider for higher margin markets will continue to sustain its profitable growth into the future 
the combination of innovative products  new state of the art facilities and focused acquisitions will continue to support its growth objectives in a highly competitive  consolidating industry 
golden technologies golden technologies net sales were million  an increase of million or compared to net sales of million 
net sales in declined million compared to net sales of million 
almost million of the increase was the impact of the november  acquisition of a majority interest in photocomm  a solar electric distributor 
the remaining increase was the result of increased selling prices for commodities that are byproducts of the high fructose corn syrup operation  offset in part by lower selling prices for fructose 
the decrease in sales was the result of businesses that were disposed of in golden technologies reported an operating loss of million in  which included asset impairment and restructuring charges of million 
operating losses for were million  including million in restructuring costs 
the asset impairment charges were taken primarily to reflect the impact of unfavorable market conditions for high fructose corn syrup and the company s inability at this time to demonstrate the commercial viability of its cadmium telluride solar panel production process 
the restructuring charges pertain to a reorganization of administrative functions at golden technologies and management realignments in the solar energy distribution business 
the restructuring charge related to the exit of certain non strategic ceramic research projects 
excluding the impact of the asset impairment and restructuring charges  golden technologies operating loss increased from million in to million in the results included approximately million of operating income from the corn wet milling business while operating results of this business were approximately break even 
because of the oversupply present in the corn fructose marketplace and significant declines in fructose selling prices  a decision was reached in february of to exit the high fructose corn syrup business 
golden technologies net sales for will decline significantly as an outcome of this decision  although net sales will reflect an entire year of sales from the november acquisition of photocomm 
an additional charge of approximately million to million is expected to be recorded in the first quarter related to the decision to exit the high fructose corn syrup business 
future activity at golden technologies will be directed primarily toward the solar electric distribution business and the development of biodegradable polymers 
start up of a million pound per year semi works lactide monomer facility in johnstown  colorado  is targeted to begin near the end of the first quarter of this facility  combined with a polylactide facility currently under construction  is intended to enable golden technologies to put biodegradable polymers in the hands of customers for qualification tests in mid to late financial resources and liquidity acx technologies liquidity is generated from both internal and external sources and is used to fund short term working capital needs  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
internally generated liquidity is measured by net cash from operations as discussed below and working capital 
at december   the company s working capital excluding the net current assets of the discontinued operation was million with a current ratio of to the company considers its working capital sufficient to meet its anticipated short term requirements 
in addition  in march of  the company completed the sale of golden aluminum 
this sale generated million in cash at closing and is expected to generate an additional million in cash within two years if the buyer does not return golden aluminum to the company as permitted by the purchase agreement 
the working capital of golden aluminum  which was not part of the sale agreement  will be liquidated during the first half of and is expected to produce between million and million in cash 
for long term requirements  the company has a multi year unsecured revolving credit facility with a total commitment of million  under which no borrowings were outstanding at december  and the company also has a canadian bank credit facility with a total commitment of c million 
under this facility  no borrowings were outstanding at december  and in addition  the company has in place a shelf registration statement  which allows the company to borrow or sell up to million in securities 
the company currently expects that cash flows from operations and the sale of golden aluminum and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities will be adequate to meet the company s needs for working capital  temporary financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows  net cash provided by operations was million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily attributable to increased losses experienced in discontinued operations as well as declines in accounts payable and the reduction in deferred revenue associated with aluminum and corn commodities hedging programs 
during  and  net cash from operations was used to fund capital requirements and acquisitions 
over this three year period  total capital expenditures for the company  excluding corporate  were million  as follows in millions coors ceramics graphic packaging golden technologies golden aluminum discontinued in consolidated capital spending during has been primarily for technological upgrades to machinery and equipment and related computer systems as well as costs associated with facility expansions and reconfigurations 
the company expects its capital expenditures for to be more than million  primarily at coors ceramics and graphic packaging 
coors ceramics has planned facility and material preparation expansions while graphic packaging s capital will be used for performance improvements to existing equipment and to increase capacity for growing markets 
golden technologies plans are to complete the semi works facilities for its biodegradable polymer technology 
acquisitions during consumed over million in cash  primarily for the fourth quarter acquisition of a majority interest in a solar energy distribution company 
cash was also used to fund part of graphic packaging s acquisition of a folding carton facility in virginia and coors ceramics acquisition of assets of an oklahoma based manufacturer that services the oilfield industry 
although a future strategy of the company is to pursue niche acquisitions that provide growth and synergies with the base businesses  there are currently no planned acquisitions that would put a constraint on the company s cash position 
the impact of inflation on the company s financial position and results of operations has been minimal and is not expected to adversely affect future results
