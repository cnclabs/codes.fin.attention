such cautionary statements are set forth under the heading important information regarding forward looking statements below in this item the discussion contained in this item should be read in connection with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes elsewhere in this form k 
in all periods discussed herein  the company s fiscal year ended on september general during the current fiscal year discussed below  the company s results of operations and financial condition have been affected by two acquisitions and the filing of the chapter proceeding by autoworks 
the first acquisition occurred in october  the company acquired a former customer with four direct distribution centers which operated in the rochester  new york area 
the total purchase price was million  of which the company paid  in cash and the balance with deferred payments 
these locations have been integrated into the company s direct distribution center division 
the second acquisition occurred in may  when the company acquired a former jobbing customer which operated in the canandaigua  new york trading area 
the total purchase price was  of which  was paid in cash and the balance with deferred payments 
this acquisition is being operated as a jobbing store within the full service distribution division 
the company financed the cash portions of these purchases with borrowings under its prior revolving credit facility 
due to autoworks continuing losses and negative cash flow  the company decided during fiscal to exit the retail business and focus its operations in the wholesale automotive aftermarket segment 
autoworks filed a chapter petition for reorganization on july  as a result  the company has deconsolidated autoworks and classified it as a discontinued operation in the company s financial statements and all previous periods have been restated to reflect this treatment  references herein to previous period figures are to the restated figures and do not include autoworks 
in connection with this treatment  the company recorded a one time charge of million  net of taxes  during the third fiscal quarter of results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal increased million  or  from the prior fiscal year  to million 
the increase is attributable to increases of at the direct distribution centers and at the full service distribution centers  partially offset by a decline in net sales at the advantage auto stores 
the direct distribution centers increase resulted from the october acquisition of four direct distribution centers and a increase in comparable location sales from the previous fiscal year 
the advantage auto stores decline in net sales is principally due to three store closings during fiscal and a decrease in comparable net sales primarily as the result of increased competition in certain markets 
gross profit from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or  of net sales for fiscal gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased as the result of the two acquisitions during fiscal  and to a lesser extent  the changing sales mix and maturation of the direct distribution division  which generally has a higher gross margin than full service distribution center sales 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal  or of net sales  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the two fiscal acquisitions  increased payroll expenses and additional administrative expenses associated with the autoworks bankruptcy filing 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  for fiscal from the previous fiscal year 
this increase is attributable to the write off of capitalized origination costs associated with the company s prior credit facility which was replaced by the company s new credit facility described below which were being amortized over the term of the prior facility  and an increase in amortization expense related to goodwill associated with the acquisitions 
the increases were partially offset by the utilization of operating leases rather than the purchase of fixed assets as a result of the capital expenditure limitation imposed by the company s then effective credit facility 
income from continuing operations before interest and taxes for fiscal decreased million from million  or of net sales in fiscal  to million  or of net sales in fiscal primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 
interest expense increased  in fiscal to million compared to million for the previous year 
this increase is attributable to higher average borrowings outstanding in fiscal and a higher interest rate during the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to the company s forebearance agreement under its prior credit facility 
interest expense for fiscal is expected to decrease significantly as a result of decreased borrowings  and the lower interest rates on the company s new credit facility 
the fiscal provision for income taxes on income from continuing operations was million  an effective rate of  as compared to million  an effective rate of  in fiscal due to the decrease in income from continuing operations 
the effective rate in both years differs from the federal rate of primarily due to state income taxes 
as a result of the factors discussed above  for fiscal  the company had income from continuing operations of million  or 
per share  as compared to the last fiscal year s income from continuing operations of million  or 
per share 
during fiscal the company incurred a net loss of million  or a share  compared to net income of million  or 
a share  in fiscal the loss incurred in fiscal includes the one time charge relative to autoworks as discussed above of million  net of tax  and losses from discontinued operations for the first nine months of the fiscal year of million  net of tax 
net income in fiscal includes losses from discontinued operations of million  net of tax 
earnings per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding as of september  and have been restated to reflect the stock dividends to shareholders of record on april  and this dividend was distributed on may of both years 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal increased million  or  over the prior fiscal year  to million 
the most significant contributing factor to this increase was a increase in net sales at the direct distribution centers  resulting from the opening of a new location and a full twelve months of sales from the location that opened in fiscal additionally  sales from advantage auto stores and the full service distribution centers increased by and  respectively  over the prior fiscal year 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared with million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar increase is attributable to the overall increase in net sales as discussed above  while the percentage decrease is due to the change in sales mix the significant increase in lower margin sales from the direct distribution centers relative to a much smaller increase in higher margin sales of the advantage auto stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  from million in fiscal  or of net sales 
the increase resulted largely from the opening of a new direct distribution location and a full year of expense from the direct distribution location that opened in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense decreased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is due to the increased utilization of operating leases rather than the purchase of fixed assets as a result of the capital expenditure limitation imposed by the company s then effective credit facility

investing activities consist mainly of routine capital expenditures for delivery vehicles  computer equipment  and store and warehouse fixtures 
capital expenditures from continuing operations were million   and million in each of the last three fiscal years 
financing activities during fiscal and consumed million and million of net cash  respectively  and provided million of cash during fiscal funds consumed during fiscal and fiscal reflect payments on long term debt and a reduction of net borrowings under the company s prior credit facility 
in  such payments were partially offset by the issuance of subordinated debt to michael futerman and eli n 
futerman  chief executive officer and president of the company  respectively 
in fiscal  the million provided by financing activities was the result of increased borrowings on the credit facility  partially offset by payments on long term debt 
the company is subject to various actual and potential losses  claims  obligations and proceedings  including those pertaining to autoworks as well as others  as disclosed in part i  item  above and in note to the financial statements 
the company has made provision for certain anticipated operating expenses such as certain real estate and equipment lease obligations and self insured exposures of autoworks for which it may be jointly liable with autoworks  recorded at million at september  while the company believes that these recorded liabilities and other reserves are reasonable in light of the company s current information  the judgments involved in the determination thereof are inherently subjective and uncertain such that there can be no assurance that they will prove sufficient in light of future developments 
further  the company believes that its information systems contain year deficiencies  which the company s third party maintenance contractor has undertaken to correct at no increased cost to the company 
however  such contractor has not yet advised the company of the timing or other details of its correction program 
in the future the company expects to make minor strategic acquisitions and open new direct distribution centers and advantage auto stores to the extent that its debt service and other funding requirements permit 
the company s ability to continue to open new direct distribution centers will depend on the company s ability to negotiate extended payment terms with vendors  which initially minimizes additional working capital requirements 
the company believes that it will be able to continue to obtain such financing

the company is required to adopt the computation  presentation and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
for the fiscal year ending september  the adoption of fas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s earnings per share as currently determined 
inflation the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
in general  the company has been able to pass on to its customers any increases in the cost of its inventory 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on the demand for automotive aftermarket products 
historically  the company s net sales and gross profits have been higher in the second half of each fiscal year than in the first half 
important information regarding forward looking statements certain statements contained in this form k which are not historical facts  including but not limited to i anticipated trends in the company s business and the automotive replacement parts industry  ii the sufficiency of cash to fund the company s debt service requirements and working capital needs and iii the statements found under the captions results of operations and liquidity and capital resources above  are forward looking statements within the meanings of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of  as amended  such statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  plan and similar expressions 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
the actual results of the future events described in the forward looking statements in this form k could materially differ from those contemplated in the forward looking statements in this form k 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties i discussed herein  ii contained in the company s other public reports and filings and public statements from time to time and iii set forth below the company is highly leveraged  with substantial existing indebtedness 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on  or to refinance  its indebtedness will depend on its future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions  prevailing interest rate levels  and financial  competitive  business and other factors beyond its control 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences  including i the company s future ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes may be limited because of the existence of this indebtedness and the borrowing advance terms thereof  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness until its term loan and supplemental line of credit have been paid in full  thereby reducing funds available for operation  iii certain of the company s borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could cause the company to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates  and iv the company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and may be limited in its ability to respond to competitive pressures 
failure to comply with the company s payment  covenant or other obligations under its credit facilities could result in a default thereunder that  if not cured or waived  could result in acceleration of the relevant indebtedness or of other indebtedness governed by agreements or instruments containing cross default provisions 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and its dollar sales and unit volume could be negatively affected by its ability to maintain or increase prices  changes in sales mix and changes in the demand for automotive products and changes in the automotive replacement parts industry generally  including pricing and other changes by the company s competitors 
the company competes directly and indirectly with numerous distributors  retailers and manufacturers of automotive aftermarket products  some of which distribute in channels that may be expanding in terms of market share relative to the channels in which the company distributes its products 
in addition  some of the company s current and potential competitors are larger  have greater financial resources  and are less leveraged than the company 
furthermore  particularly in light of the trend in the automotive parts industry toward increasing consolidation at the warehouse and jobber levels  the company s financial performance may be significantly affected by the company s ability to compete successfully for associated jobber customers and otherwise take advantage of consolidation opportunities and other trends 
the company s financial performance is subject to and could be negatively impacted by changes in economic conditions  vehicle quality  new parts warranties and maintenance  vehicle scrappage rates and weather conditions  which can cause seasonal variations in the company s results of operations 
the occurrence of violent weather or mild weather may result in significant fluctuations in operating results 
temperature extremes tend to enhance sales by causing a higher incidence of parts failure and increasing sales of seasonal products  while milder weather tends to depress sales 
the company s continued growth and financial performance depends  in part  on the company s ability to secure the consent of its lender to future acquisitions and the company s ability to conclude past and future acquisitions on favorable terms and to enhance those acquisitions and integrate them into its operations 
full realization of the potential benefits of any significant acquisition will be dependent upon a variety of factors  including i retention of substantial portion of sales  ii achieving sales volumes sufficient to utilize reductions in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales  iii achieving significant reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses by  among other things  consolidating redundant operating and administrative facilities and closure of non performing facilities  and iv obtaining deferred payment terms and other changeover incentives from suppliers 
there can be no assurance as to the extent to which any such benefits may be realized from any acquisitions or the timing of any such realization 
failure to achieve a substantial portion of such potential benefits within time frames anticipated by the company could materially and adversely affect the company s future results of operations and financial position 
the company is subject to risks  uncertainties and expenses associated with the autoworks bankruptcy proceeding 
the official unsecured creditors committee in the autoworks bankruptcy proceeding has asserted  and is investigating  certain alleged claims against the company 
see note to financial statements and part i  item legal proceedings above 
these claims have not presently been brought in any adversary proceeding 
the company does not believe that it should be held liable under applicable law should any such adversary proceeding be commenced  and would defend itself vigorously therein 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any such proceeding or  because of the early stage of discovery  as to the magnitude of any potential exposure therefrom 
further  there can be no assurance that such committee or other parties to the bankruptcy proceeding will not assert and bring other claims against the company in the future 
the company believes that the committee is investigating  through bankruptcy court discovery  both its asserted claims and other possible claims which it may or may not assert in the future 
the company will therefore be subject to risks  uncertainties and expenses  as well as to the expense and liquidity impact of any unfavorable outcomes or settlements 
to the extent that the company sustains losses growing out of the autoworks bankruptcy which are presently not reserved or otherwise provided for  its earnings and liquidity could be adversely affected 
the company s past success has been largely dependent on certain key personnel of the company  including michael futerman  eli n 
futerman and daniel j 
chessin 
the loss of the services of these individuals could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
additionally  in order to implement and manage its growth strategy  the company will be dependent upon its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to continue to secure or retain such personnel
