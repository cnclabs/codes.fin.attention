revenues 
total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million to approximately million compared to total revenues of approximately for the year ended december  the decline was primarily attributable to declines in revenues from the c band dth market million  cpv million and hvc million  totaling approximately million

the company expects to realize significant reductions in the costs resulting directly from the digital conversion see discussion of satellite expenses 
the revenues from cpv decreased as a result of the company s decision to cease production activity in the beginning of in the united kingdom  two new competing adult services were launched in the fourth quarter of the new adult services compete directly with the adult channel  the company s united kingdom satellite delivered adult network 
in addition  in the second half of  the adult channel switched satellites to a satellite which could not be viewed by many of its existing subscribers without the purchase of new equipment 
these two factors have resulted in a decline in revenues of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in revenues from the spice networks cable market increased by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the same periods in  a gain of approximately 
the company increased the number of addressable households with access to the spice networks at december  by approximately over the number of such addressable households at december  the percentage increase in addressable subscribers did not translate into the same percentage increase in revenues due to normal delays in realizing revenues from new subscribers and a reduction in the company s share of revenues referred to as license fees in the company s agreements with cable operators from cable sales of the spice networks

the asset is depreciated  on the straight line method  over the satellite s estimated year useful life 
the actual lease payments are applied against the principal and interest of the obligation similar to a fully amortizing mortgage loan 
for the year ended december  the company recognized total expenses attributable to the lease of approximately million comprised of depreciation expense of approximately million and interest expense of approximately million

interest expense 
interest expense from continuing operations increased by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in million of the increase is attributable to the interest expense recognized under the capitalized at t transponder lease during  as compared to when the domestic transponder leases were accounted for as operating leases
