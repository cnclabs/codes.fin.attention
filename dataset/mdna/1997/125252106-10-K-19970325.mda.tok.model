income before taxes and minority interest 
provision for income taxes minority interest net income loss the fourth quarter sales for and have been stronger than the third quarter sales  primarily due to the growth in printed coating products 
offsetting this increase  however  is a seasonal decrease in pharmaceutical product sales  as people typically defer elective surgeries between thanksgiving and new years 
in addition  many of the companys customers attempt to reduce their inventories prior to the calendar year end 
consequently  first quarter sales are typically stronger than the preceding fourth quarter 
the gross profit in the third quarter of was lower due to unusually high start up costs due to new technology relating to the introduction by the company of a new product for the manufactured housing industry and lower sales volume spreading fixed costs over fewer units 
selling  general and administrative expense increased as a result of a one time investment whereby the company engaged the services of a consulting firm to develop a marketing strategy for the pacific rim and approximately  of service costs due to the re engineering of manufacturing functions 
the net loss in the fourth quarter of was due to the termination of the companys s corporation tax status and the resultant recording of deferred taxes of  liquidity and capital resources the companys primary sources of working capital have been net cash provided by operating activities and net borrowings under various loan agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
the decline in net cash provided by operating activities in was largely attributable to the increase in working capital from million at december  to million at december  this increase is primarily due to managements decision to increase inventory levels by approximately  to support anticipated demand from certain key customers and product lines 
other components of working capital increased due primarily to a net reduction in the current liabilities relating to the payment of a dividend of approximately  to the pre ipo shareholders in for their share of taxes on the companys scorporation income and a  reduction in accrued bonus and gain share obligations pursuant to the companys employee bonus plan and gain share plan 
the companys capital expenditures totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  and included the following the acquisition of the wide embosser for holographic coatings in  the acquisition of high speed computerized slitting equipment in  and  progress payments for the new wide printing press in to fund their income tax liabilities on the companys net income and the repayment of stockholder loans  the company previously made s corporation dividends to its existing stockholders of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  which included a special million scorporation dividend paid immediately prior to the closing of the ipo in in june  the company received proceeds of approximately  pursuant to an illinois revenue bond financing  which matures in these proceeds are being used to finance the acquisition of the new wide printing press and related plant additions to ensure capacity for the continued growth of the companys printed products line 
at december   million of this borrowing had not been used 
this unused portion of the borrowings was classified as restricted cash and was invested in short term investments 
the company incurred  of costs associated with the issuance of the bonds  which will be amortized over twelve years 
the companys revolving credit agreement with a bank the credit facility provides for borrowings under a revolving credit loan of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  with total borrowings not to exceed  the principal balance of the revolving credit loan was zero at december  the revolving credit loan expired february  and bore interest at the banks prime rate at december  or  at the companys option  at libor at december  plus 
the credit facility was renewed as an unsecured facility with total borrowings not to exceed  expiring april   and bears interest at the banks prime rate or  at the companys option  at libor plus 
a 
fee applies for undrawn funds 
the credit facility also provides for two term loans 
the outstanding principal balance of term loan a was  as of december  and was due april  term loan a was extended until february  interest on term loan a accrues at the banks prime rate plus  but not to exceed 
all amounts outstanding on the companys term loan b were repaid in the credit facility contains covenants which limit aggregate annual lease payments to  and capital expenditures to million and prohibit the declaration of dividends other than scorporation dividends and the million s corporation dividend and transactions between the company and its affiliates 
it is also an event of default under the credit facility if the company incurs any net losses for any fiscal period 
the bank waived the capital expenditure covenant for the purposes of acquisition of the new press and related property developments in the company believes that the net cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the credit facility are sufficient to finance the companys growth 
seasonality and impact of inflation historically  the company has experienced lower net sales levels during the fourth quarter and increased net sales levels during the following first quarter 
this is due to typical yearend depletion of inventories by the companys customers 
it is also due in large part to the holidays at the end of the year  as the companys customers have an increased number of holiday plant closings 
in addition  fourth quarter pharmaceutical product sales generally are lower as a result of the postponement of elective surgeries during holiday periods 
however  due to the strong growth of printed products  the fourth quarter sales have been greater than the third quarter sales in each of the last two years 
inflation has not had a material impact on the companys net sales or income to date 
however  there can be no assurance that the companys business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
recently issued accounting standards the fasb has issued statement of financial account standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which became effective in this statement establishes an alternative to the companys current method of accounting for compensation associated with stock issued to employees 
management did not adopt the alternative method allowed by sfas no 
accordingly  adoption of this statement required additional financial statement footnote disclosures to describe the companys stock based compensation 
special note on forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of a number of important factors could cause the companys actual results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
these factors include  among other things continuation of market growth trends  reliance on a single manufacturing facility  reliance on key personnel  control by the principal shareholder  the companys reliance on significant customers  the companys ability to develop new products and protect the proprietary formulae and technology related to its products  the companys ability to be competitive with other producers of specialty transferable coatings and alternative products  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and their impact on the level and profitability of foreign sales  and general economic conditions as they may impact the companys customers
