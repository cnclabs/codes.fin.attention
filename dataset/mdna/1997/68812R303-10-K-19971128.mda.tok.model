item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leader in the field of genomics based drug discovery the identification and functional characterization of genes 
the company has over ten years of experience in positional cloning  having served as one of the primary researchers under genome programs sponsored by the united states government  and has developed numerous techniques and tools that are widely used in the field 
the company s commercial gene discovery strategy capitalizes on its pioneering work in genomics by applying its high throughput sequencing technology and positional cloning  its experience and skills in functional genomics and its bioinformatics capabilities 
the two areas of focus are the discovery and characterization of i genes of pathogens that are responsible for many serious diseases and ii human disease genes 
the company believes that its genomic discoveries may lead to the development of novel therapeutics  vaccines and diagnostic products by it and its strategic partners 
the company has entered into several corporate collaborations in connection with its pathogen and human gene discovery programs 
the company does not anticipate revenues from product sales on a sustained basis until such time that products based on the company s research efforts are commercialized  if at all 
the company s product development strategy is to form collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies generating revenues from licensing fees  sponsored research and milestone payments 
additionally  the company will sell non exclusive access to its proprietary genome sequence database  pathogenome tm 
these collaborations are expected to result in the discovery and commercialization of novel therapeutics  vaccines and diagnostics  generating royalty payments to the company from product sales downstream 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on the company s research  it will be necessary for the collaborators to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  obtain regulatory clearances and make manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements 
accordingly  the company does not expect to receive royalties based upon product revenues for many years 
for the past several years  the company s primary sources of revenue have been government research grants and contracts and collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical company partners 
as of august   the company had three collaborative research agreements and one subscriber to its proprietary genome sequence database  pathogenome tm 
in september  subsequent to fiscal year end  the company entered into its fourth collaborative research agreement and added two additional subscribers to its pathogenome tm database 
the company entered into corporate collaborations with astra hassle ab astra relating to h 
pylori in august and with schering corporation and schering plough  ltd 
collectively  schering plough in december providing for the use by schering plough of the company s staph 
aureus genomic database to identify new gene targets for the development of novel antibiotics 
in december  the company entered into its second research collaboration with schering plough to identify genes and associated proteins that can be utilized by schering plough to develop new pharmaceuticals for treating asthma 
in september  subsequent to the fiscal year end  the company entered into its third research collaboration with schering plough to use genomics to discover and develop new pharmaceutical products to treat fungal infections 
in may  the company sold its first subscription to its proprietary genome sequence database  pathogenome tm to bayer ag bayer

government research revenue decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in government research revenue in both fiscal and was primarily attributable to a shift in personnel from government research programs to company sponsored research and development programs  in particular  the microbial genetic database program  pathogenome tm 
revenue derived from government research grants and contracts is generally based upon direct cost such as labor  laboratory supplies  as well as an allocation for reimbursement of a portion of overhead expenses
