liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital requirements are for inventory  store relocation and remodeling

also a new computer system was installed

historically  net cash used or provided by financing activities has resulted primarily from the advance or pay down of a revolving credit line 
for fiscal  and and  peak borrowings on that credit line were million  million  million  respectively 
prior to fiscal and through may  the company maintained a revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  na wells 
the wells credit line was paid off with the proceeds from the credit facility with bankamerica business credit  inc  an affiliate of bank of america babc  described below 
in may  the company obtained a credit facility from babc  that provided a new line of credit to borrow up to million less the amount of any outstanding draws on authorized letters of credit and or any applicable limitations on maximum borrowings 
maximum borrowings generally could not exceed of the value of eligible inventory and was also reduced to reflect reserves or other adjustments 
interest was at prime plus 
the initial million proceeds from this financing were used to extinguish all of the company s obligations under the credit facility with wells 
in march  a new credit facility from bank of america national trust and savings association  inc the new lender was established which provides for advances up to million less the amount of any outstanding draws up to a million maximum in authorized letters of credit 
maximum borrowings generally may not exceed of the value of eligible inventory  as defined  and may also be reduced under certain circumstances to reflect reserves or other adjustments 
interest accrues at prime or may be fixed for a period of time at the then current rate established under one of several indices  all at the company s option 
this credit facility expires august  proceeds from this loan were used to extinguish all obligations under the babc credit facility 
the company s obligation to the new lender is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the company s non real estate assets  and the company is subject to several restrictive covenants as set forth in the loan and security agreement with the new lender which is attached as an exhibit to this form k 
the principal operating covenants require the company to maintain certain minimum cash flow coverage  and restrict the level of losses and capital expenditures  calculated on a quarterly basis 
the company currently is in full compliance with these covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit facility 
however  unexpected conditions could cause the company to alter its plans to avoid a breach of the agreement with the new lender or could cause the company to violate a restrictive covenant or otherwise breach that agreement 
if a breach occurs  the new lender will have all rights customarily provided to a secured lender  including the right to foreclose on the secured collateral or to accelerate the maturity of the loan obligations 
no cash dividends have been declared on common stock in fiscal the company intends to retain earnings for use in the operation and limited expansion of its business and  therefore  does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations as noted previously  the months of november  december and january historically have accounted for the largest percentage of the company s net sales and a significant portion of its net income 
as is typical with other sporting goods retailers  the company s sales volume increases significantly during the christmas holiday season and the peak ski season generally corresponds to this three month period 
in the past  the company s operating results were also influenced by the amount and timing of snowfall at the ski areas frequented by those living in southern california  particularly the mammoth mountain ski resort in the eastern sierra nevada mountains 
an early snowfall at mammoth historically has influenced sales because it extends the demand for ski apparel and equipment while a late snowfall may have the opposite effect 
however  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  sales of winter related products were relatively weak despite early and substantial snowfall at mammoth 
management believes that this was the result of poor snow conditions at local southern california ski resorts and the maturing nature of the winter related products business 
management currently projects little or no growth in winter related product sales relative to other specialty product areas of the company s business 
accordingly  the effect of snow conditions on the company s operating results have been and are being mitigated by management s actions to diversify the company s product mix 
sales of ski apparel and equipment have decreased over the last five fiscal years from to of total company sales revenue 
suppliers in the ski industry require that commitments be made for purchases of apparel and equipment by april for fall delivery  and only limited quantities of merchandise can be reordered during the fall 
consequently  the company places its orders in the spring anticipating snowfall in the winter 
if the snowfall does not at least provide an adequate base or occurs late in the season  or if sales do not meet projections  the company may be required to mark down its ski merchandise
