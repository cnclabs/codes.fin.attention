the drilling segment anticipates capital expenditures of approximately  for fiscal to be funded from existing bank credit lines and cash flow from operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included as a part of item of this report 
due to numerous uncertainties regarding the availability  price and delivery of certain drilling equipment  the registrant s anticipated level of capital expenditures may fluctuate commensurate with the volatility of the industry 
management of the registrant believes that cash flows from operations and borrowings should be sufficient to fund continuing operations and adequately service the registrant s debt for the next twelve months 
however  the ability of the registrant to perform under the existing terms of its debt agreements and adequately extinguish certain other liabilities associated with its discontinued segments is contingent upon the registrant s ability to successfully negotiate with its creditors primarily creditors of the mri and nursery segments 
furthermore  the inherent macroeconomic risks associated with the oil and gas industry  such as the volatility of oil and gas prices  could adversely affect the registrant s operations

recent accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation which was issued in is not effective until fiscal year the statement defines a fair value based method of accounting ie  using an option pricing model such as black scholes for employee stock options or similar equity instrument plans  but also allows an entity to measure compensation costs for those plans using the intrinsic value the amount by the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the underlying price of the option based method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
the company plans to continue using the intrinsic value based method 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities was issued in and is not effective until fiscal year this statement provides standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities that are based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
preliminary analysis of this new standard by management indicates that it will not have a material adverse impact on the company
