sales in thousands of pounds by division swiss american    royal angelus    comparison of years ended december  and in  sales of  were up from sales of  as the result of increased sales at the swiss american meat division 
the meat division s sales were up about in dollars and in pounds in over and swiss had a substantial operating profit in versus a substantial loss in swiss s sales for the th quarter of were up in dollars and in pounds over the th quarter of sales increased proportionately more in dollars than in pounds because of higher selling prices reflecting higher meat costs 
the increase in sales and profitability at swiss resulted from special pizza chain orders and a reversal of a long term erosion in sales and profitability which began in the company continues to seek a meat processing business complementary to swiss which could be combined with swiss to enhance swiss s profitability  but currently has no likely prospect 
the royal angelus pasta division s sales decreased about in dollars and in pounds in over  after record annual sales in both dollars and pounds in the pasta division s sales for the th quarter of were down in dollars and in pounds over the same quarter of the percent decreases were higher in dollars than in pounds because of a higher proportion of sales of bulk products rather than retail packaged products 
the cost of semolina flour increased about in and has remained up since then  decreasing slightly in but remaining well above pre levels 
this cost increase puts pressure on margins and prices  because if passed on to consumers they might reduce consumption  and if passed on to customers  they might seek a cheaper supplier 
at the same time  increasing industry capacity is causing increased price competition  adversely affecting sales and prices 
the high flour prices and increased price competition caused royal s operating income to be lower in than the company s gross profit for was  or of net sales compared to  or of net sales for gross profit increased absolutely and as a percent of sales because swiss s sales increased but its production costs increased less than proportionate to its sales 
distribution  general and administrative expenses for were down about from distribution expense was up about  or despite increased freight on a increase in sales  because of decreases in swiss s salesmen payroll and sales commissions 
administrative expense was down about  because of lower bad debt expense and collections on doubtful accounts  partially offset by higher clerical payroll  consulting fees relating to swiss and other outside services 
other income decreased about  because a lease of a vacant lot being sublet and a space sharing arrangement at swiss both ended 
net interest expense increased about  because of interest on the term loan used to purchase the nd royal building 
comparison of years ended december  and in  sales of  were down from sales of  despite record sales by the royal angelus pasta division 
the swiss american meat division s sales were down about in dollars and in pounds in versus and swiss had an operating loss in substantially greater than in swiss s sales for the th quarter of were down in dollars but up in pounds compared to the th quarter of sales decreased proportionately more in dollars than in pounds because of a combination of lower meat costs and intense competition 
the decrease in sales and profitability at swiss was a continuation of a long term erosion in sales and profitability which began in and is attributed to over capacity to produce pepperoni for pizza  reduced growth in pizza consumption and intense competition 
the most likely way to improve swiss s performance would be to increase its sales 
management concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of growing swiss back to profitability and engaged a consultant to seek a specialty meat processing business complementary to swiss which could be combined with swiss to result in a profitable meat business by having a meat plant operating near capacity 
the royal angelus pasta division s sales increased about in dollars and in pounds in over  record annual sales in both dollars and pounds for royal 
the pasta division s sales for the th quarter of were up in dollars and in pounds over the same quarter of the percent increases were lower in dollars than in pounds because of sales of a higher proportion of high volume rather than specialty products and the continuing effect of the high cost of flour 
the cost of semolina flour began rising in and was up about from pre levels through this cost increase put pressure on margins and prices  because if the full increase was passed on to the consumer  less consumption might result and if it was passed on to the company s customers  they might seek a cheaper supplier 
this pressure on margins and prices caused royal s operating profit to be lower in than  despite increased sales 
the company s gross profit for was  or of net sales compared to  or of net sales for gross profit decreased absolutely and as a percent of sales because of continuing pressure on margins at both divisions and the inefficiency of operating at low volumes at swiss 
distribution  general and administrative expenses for were down about from distribution expense was down about  or compared to an decrease in sales  because salesmen payroll did not decrease and the company bore the freight on a higher proportion of sales at both divisions 
administrative expense was up about  primarily because of an increase in bad debt expense 
other income increased about  and net interest expense increased about  primarily because of rent from the building adjacent to the pasta plant purchased in and interest on the term loan used to purchase it

swiss american sausage division s san francisco meat processing plant has a theoretical production capacity estimated at  pounds per year  compared to about  pounds sold in the meat plant s present capacity is adequate for the currently contemplated needs of the division  but the plant does not have space to increase its capacity or the variety of meat products which can be produced 
the lease of the main production building expires in and in the company intends to move the plant into a newly leased or purchased building with the same capacity as the present plant  but with the capability of increasing capacity or product variety 
accomplishing the move requires locating and acquiring a suitable building  improving the building for use as a meat processing plant  installing meat processing equipment  arranging for a lessor or lender or both to finance the acquisition and improvement of the building and installation of equipment  and obtaining the consent of wells fargo bank  na to the transaction  all of which remain to be done 
the annual cost to swiss of the new plant building will exceed the annual cost of its two current buildings and swiss will bear the cost of rent on its nd building until the lease expires in  less any amount received from subletting the nd building
