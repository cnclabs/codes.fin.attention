the additional acreage is sufficient to expand the new plant by an additional  square feet 
production bays in the new plant have been designed to accommodate larger projects  while allowing for improved throughput and better efficiency in constructing newly designed and standardized automation equipment 
atlas operates out of three locations and  as of july   conducts final assembly in the new facility
