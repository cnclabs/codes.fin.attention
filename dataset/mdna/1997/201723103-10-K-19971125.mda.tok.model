most importantly  during the fourth quarter the company began to implement modest price increases in the united states on reinforcing bar and merchant shapes 
some improvement is being seen in overall pricing of fabricated steel 
construction markets in the us are strong  margins on copper plumbing tube should improve and ferrous scrap markets are steady 
the trends in nonferrous metal prices are diverse  but demand should remain active 
europe is improving  but most asian economies have slowed because of the currency turmoil 
the continued economic pickup in latin america  especially mexico  should be beneficial 
the outlook for public construction remains positive and  longer term  infrastructure spending should increase 
expenses related to the steel group computer migration in fiscal should continue in the million dollar range 
in connection with the aforementioned termination of its last defined benefit plan  the company estimates that total pension expense for will be million which includes both normal pension costs and a one time settlement liability

strong company earnings and record depreciation expense generated the cash flow

contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting its business  the company becomes involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental matters 
the company s origin and one of its core businesses for over three quarters of a century has been metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  the company has a continuing commitment to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are presently at odds with goals of greater recycling and expose the company and the industry to potentially significant risks 
such exposures are causing the industry to shrink  leaving fewer but more well financed operators as survivors to face the challenge 
the company believes that materials that are recycled are commodities that are neither discarded nor disposed 
they are diverted by recyclers from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
environmental agencies at various federal and state levels would classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
the company has received notices from the us environmental protection agency epa or equivalent state agency that it is considered a potentially responsible party prp at thirteen sites  none owned by the company  and may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
the company is involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which the company is contesting  or at the appropriate time may contest  its prp designation 
in addition  the company has received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
some of these environmental matters or other proceedings may result in fines  penalties or judgments being assessed against the company which  from time to time  may have a material impact on earnings and cash flows for a particular quarter 
while the company is unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with the above referenced matters  it makes accruals as warranted 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the outcome of these proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the business or consolidated financial position of the company 
in fiscal  the company incurred environmental expense of million 
this included the cost to staff environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessment  and remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
the company estimates that approximately million of its capital expenditures for fiscal related to costs associated with environmental compliance 
the nature and timing of these environmental costs is such that it is not practical for the company to estimate their magnitude in future periods 
at august  million remained in accrued expenses for environmental liabilities 
the november  final order of the united states district court for the southern district of texas against cmc oil company  a subsidiary of the company  is now a final  non appealable order 
this liability has been accrued in the financial statements of cmc oil company 
cmc oil does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the judgment 
no claim has been asserted against commercial metals company in connection with this litigation 
commercial metals company will vigorously contest liability should any such claim be asserted
