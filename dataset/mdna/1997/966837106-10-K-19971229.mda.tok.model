sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired 
comparable store sales in southern california in fiscal year  particularly the first three quarters  and the last quarter of fiscal were negatively impacted by the july name change from mrs 
gooch s to whole foods market 
comparable store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts  reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market 
additionally  net sales by amrion increased over the prior year by  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales increases by amrion resulted from improved customer acquisition programs and expanded retail and mass market distribution programs 
the company believes that historical sales trends may not necessarily be indicative of future results of operations 
gross profit gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs  plus contribution from non retail grocery distribution and food preparation operations 
the company s consolidated gross profit in fiscal year increased as a percentage of sales to from in fiscal year this increase reflects improved gross margins in the former fresh fields stores  increased national buying and private label initiatives which continue to lower the cost of product purchased on a national basis  and continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement and merchandising and controlling spoilage 
gross profit in fiscal decreased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal due primarily to a price reduction strategy which negatively impacted gross margin in the fresh fields stores prior to the merger with whole foods market 
in all years  gross profit margins were positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature 
relative to other stores in a region  gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature  reflecting increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams 
additionally  gross profit margins were positively affected in all years by the increased percentage of sales in certain regions and in departments such as prepared foods where the company achieves higher gross profits  and by continued reductions in product costs at amrion resulting from increased in house manufacturing and improved materials procurement 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased as a percentage of sales to from in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  direct store expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly over the prior year due to the growth of the company s retail operations in regions where the company experiences higher operating costs  offset by reduced direct store expenses as a percentage of sales for new stores as compared to historical new store results 
in direct store expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from the prior year  reflecting the impact of reductions in labor and other costs in the fresh fields stores related to the above mentioned price reduction strategy 
for all years  the decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales reflect increases in store sales without comparable increases in administrative staff  these decreases were offset by increased market development costs and increased administrative staff at amrion 
whole foods market has historically been able to expand without a significant increase in general and administrative costs 
however  in certain circumstances the company has increased the number of administrative and support personnel at the regional and national levels in connection with the implementation of new management information systems and to support current and planned growth 
pre opening and relocation costs whole foods market developed and opened five new stores in fiscal  nine new stores in fiscal  and ten new stores in fiscal the company relocated a store in the chicago area to a new  larger location in fiscal  three stores and the fresh fields corporate office in fiscal  and three stores and its national corporate office in fiscal in fiscal  the company also recognized estimated costs to close a store in san antonio in connection with the relocation of that store in the first quarter of fiscal pre opening and relocation costs in fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
pre opening costs include hiring and training personnel  supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store openings  and are expensed in the quarter of store opening 
pre opening costs are generally higher in locations which are some distance from an existing base of operations due to higher training  travel and moving costs 
relocation costs consist of losses on dispositions of fixed assets and inventories  remaining lease payments and other costs of holding replaced facilities and other related expenses 
merger and reorganization expenses merger expenses in fiscal include transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of amrion  inc merger and reorganization expenses in fiscal include severance  transaction expenses  duplicate system disposal costs and conforming accounting adjustments associated with the acquisition of fresh fields  and severance and other costs associated with the restructuring of the southern california region 
additionally  fiscal expenses include losses on the disposition of store assets  remaining rent and lease termination costs recognized pursuant to a plan initiated at the time of the fresh fields acquisition to close or relocate duplicate stores 
specifically  the plan included the following store changes the fresh fields elston store in the chicago area was closed in september and sales of the nearby whole foods market lincoln park and lakeview stores increased in fiscal as a result of the transfer of customers to those stores  the whole foods market oak street store in the chicago area was closed in september and sales of the nearby fresh fields evanston store increased as a result of the transfer of customers to that store  the fresh fields gaithersburg store in the washington dc area was closed in november just prior to the opening of the whole foods market vienna store 
the company believes that the initial sales of the vienna store were positively impacted by the transfer of customers from the gaithersburg store  and  the fresh fields naperville and evanston stores in the chicago area have been relocated in fiscal and early fiscal  respectively  to two nearby whole foods market stores 
the company believes that the two new stores service a trade area which overlaps with the trade area of the two fresh fields stores  and that the new stores will experience greater sales and profits as a result of the closing of these stores 
at september   the company has lease termination provisions remaining under the plan totaling approximately million 
the company does not expect the ultimate payment of these liabilities to materially affect its liquidity

interest expense related to the company s borrowings was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  net of capitalized interest associated with stores under development 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively  and a credit of in fiscal the income tax rate for fiscal reflects the utilization of approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the fresh fields merger on which a valuation allowance had previously been provided 
as of september   the company has remaining net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million related to net operating losses incurred by fresh fields from its inception until the fiscal acquisition by whole foods market which are available to offset certain future taxable income 
the fiscal effective tax rate reflects the non deductibility for federal income tax purposes of certain merger transaction costs that were expensed for financial accounting and reporting purposes in that year 
the income tax provision for fiscal is the expense associated with the company s income before taxes excluding the operating losses of fresh fields  which could not be utilized for income tax purposes to offset the company s taxable income in that year 
as of september   the company does not consider it more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized based on the limitations due to the application of certain tax laws 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards which the company does not currently consider recognizable
