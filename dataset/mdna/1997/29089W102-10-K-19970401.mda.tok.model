general overview in july   the company acquired substantially all of the assets pertaining to company owned stores and franchised locations then utilized by ipco in connection with the operation of its retail optical business 
the expansion of the company s franchise system was primarily attributable to the conveyance to franchisees  by the end of  of the assets of of the initially acquired company owned stores 
in october  august  november  and may  respectively  the company replenished its inventory of company owned stores with the acquisition of company owned stores as part of the sfse merger which stores were in addition to ten stores then franchised by sfse  the acquisition of eight of the stores previously licensed by ipco to pembridge  the acquisition of company owned stores in connection with the benson transaction  and the acquisition of company owned stores which stores were in addition to the stores franchised by vca in connection with the vca transaction 
the company currently derives its revenues primarily from i the sale of eye care products of which the sale of eyeglasses represented in excess of of total sales for each period since inception and by providing eye care services at company owned stores and in those franchised locations in which certain of the company s vcc operations are located  ii ongoing franchise royalties based upon the gross revenue of franchised stores  iii the conveyance of company owned store assets to franchisees  iv initial franchise fees  v interest income derived primarily from purchase money financing provided by the company on its conveyance of company owned store assets to franchisees and on the proceeds of the offering  until such time that the proceeds were expended  and  vi laser access fees paid by ophthalmologists utilizing the company s excimer lasers to perform prk procedures 
management s growth strategy is to transform the company from a retailer of optical products into a full service eye care company  including the management of its existing insight laser center and by developing affiliations with ophthalmologists to utilize the company s excimer lasers  while at the same time expanding the company s existing core business and customer base 
a key element of such strategy is to acquire existing retail optical chains  convert independently owned retail optical stores to franchised stores and open new stores 
average retail store sales and average ongoing franchise royalty information described below is computed based upon the weighted average of existing stores in each category 
since the benson transaction occurred in november  the number of benson stores and the retail store sales generated by such stores are not utilized in calculating the weighted average of existing stores and average retail store sales for the calendar year ended december  same store sales represent sales generated by company owned or franchised stores which were sterling stores in operation during the entirety of the one year periods 
net gains on the conveyance of the assets of company owned stores to franchisees vary depending upon the number of stores conveyed to franchisees  the consideration paid for the assets of each such store and the company s basis net book value in the assets of the stores conveyed 
results of operations for the calendar year ended december  compared to december  systemwide sales  which represent combined retail sales generated by company owned and franchised stores  as well as revenues generated by vca  increased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in on a same store basis for stores that operated as either a company owned or franchised store during the entirety of both of the calendar years ended december  and  systemwide sales decreased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in there were stores that operated as either a company owned or franchised store during the entirety of both of the calendar years ended december  and aggregate sales generated from the operation of company owned stores increased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in such increase was primarily due to the vca transaction in the second quarter of  which resulted in the company s acquisition  among other assets  of the assets and leases for company owned stores  which was partially offset by the decrease in aggregate sales resulting from the conveyance of the assets of company owned stores to franchisees 
historical comparisons of aggregate sales generated by company owned stores can become distorted due to the conveyance of company owned store assets to franchisees 
when company owned store assets are conveyed to franchisees  sales generated by such franchised store are no longer reflected in company owned store sales  however  the company receives on going royalties based upon a percentage of the sales generated by such franchised stores 
on a same store basis  aggregate sales generated by company owned stores in operation during the entirety of both of the calendar years and  decreased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in the company believes that such decrease resulted  in part  from general business conditions and from the company s change in its employment arrangements with certain of its optometrists from that of a salaried employee to an independent optometrist subleasing the professional office located within the sterling store in question 
this change resulted in the loss of eye examination fee income for the company of approximately  since such doctors now collect such fees as part of their income  although this contributed to the reduction in selling expenses as described below 
aggregate sales generated from the operation of franchised stores increased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  due primarily to an increase in the number of company owned stores conveyed to franchisees and certain franchised stores acquired in the vca transaction

the company s gross profit margin decreased by percentage points  to  for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in this decrease resulted primarily from the company having instituted  in the fall of  a promotional program in response to certain promotional incentives offered by certain major competitors of the company 
to match such incentives  the company offered similar types of promotional programs to its customers  which resulted in lower gross profit margins 
in the future  the company s gross profit margin may fluctuate depending upon the extent and timing of changes in the product mix in company owned stores  competition and promotional incentives 
selling expenses increased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  due to the inclusion of selling expenses of approximately  incurred by the stores acquired in connection with the benson and vca transactions  and the operations of insight  which were partially offset by a decrease in selling expenses of approximately  due primarily from the conveyance of the assets of company owned stores to franchisees  as well as a decrease in selling expenses of approximately  in connection with the change in the company s employment arrangements as described above with certain of its optometrists 
general and administrative expenses including interest expense  depreciation and bad debt expense increased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in this increase was due primarily to the following five factors i an increase in administrative costs of approximately  related to the business of insight  which incurred expenses of approximately  in  ii approximately  in administrative costs related to the benson transaction  iii approximately  in administrative costs related to the vca transaction  iv approximately  in occupancy and moving expenses related to the company s relocation  in the second quarter of  of its administrative offices  and v approximately  in costs related to operating as a publicly held company 
interest expense  which is included in general and administrative expenses  increased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in this increase was due to increased indebtedness incurred by the company in connection with the leasing  in  of five excimer lasers and  in  one additional excimer laser which are capital leases and  accordingly  such payments include interest expense  and an additional loan  at the end of the fourth quarter of  of  to fund the benson transaction 
the company s provision for doubtful accounts  which is included in general and administrative expenses  increased by  or  to  for the calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in this increase was due primarily to the reduction in the residual value of the cash collateral and franchise notes held by the cit group equipment financing  inc cit

aggregate sales generated from the operation of company owned stores decreased by  or  to  for calendar year  as compared to aggregate sales of  at company owned stores for the same period in  due to the conveyance of the assets of eight company owned stores to franchisees 
in addition  the company changed its employment arrangements with certain of its optometrists from that of a salaried employee to an independent optometrist subleasing the professional office located within the sterling store in question 
this change in status resulted in the loss of eye examination fee income for the company  since the independent doctors now collect such fees as part of their income  although this contributed to the decrease in selling expenses described below

to match such incentives  the company had offered similar types of promotional programs to its customers  which resulted previously in lower gross profit margins

selling expenses decreased by  or  to  for calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in although the company  in connection with the benson transaction  acquired an additional stores during the fourth quarter of  this decrease was primarily due to the change in the company s employment arrangement as described above with certain of its optometrists from that of a salaried employee to an independent optometrist subleasing the professional office located within the sterling store in question  and the conveyance of the assets of eight company owned stores to franchisees during the calendar year ended december  general and administrative expenses including interest expense  depreciation and bad debt expense decreased by  or  to  for calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the company s provision for doubtful accounts of  see explanation below which was partially offset by an increase in administrative costs of approximately  relating to insight  the company s investment by its wholly owned subsidiary  sterling vision of metro ny  inc in national optical services  inc nos  an entity engaged in the business of developing and administering third party provider agreements  and the company s construction and opening of an ophthalmic lens manufacturing facility  each of which had not incurred expenses until  as well as approximately  in administrative costs related to the benson transaction 
interest expense  which is included in general and administrative expenses  increased by  or  to  for calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in this increase was due to increased indebtedness incurred by the company in connection with its acquisition of eight retail optical stores from pembridge  in  and the leasing  in  of five excimer lasers which are capital leases and  accordingly  the payments under which are treated as interest expense  as partially offset by lower interest rates resulting from the refinancing  during  of the company s debt at more favorable interest rates 
the company s provision for doubtful accounts  which is included in general and administrative expenses  decreased by  or  to  as of december   as compared to  for december  this decrease resulted primarily from several factors i the company s election  in  to reserve an additional  and  against the residual value of the corresponding franchise notes held by sanwa and cit  respectively  ii the company s election to reserve  against the cash collateral held by cit see liquidity and capital resources  iii as part of the franchise system restructuring commenced by the company in the latter part of  the company wrote off  in   against certain franchise notes receivable which were subject to forgiveness upon a franchisee s compliance with certain financial covenants  and iv based upon historical performance  the company reduced its reserve against accounts and notes receivable by approximately  the company s income before extraordinary item and income taxes increased by  or  to  for calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in during  the company consummated the benson transaction and thereby acquired substantially all of the assets and certain continuing expenses of the sellers  began incurring costs in anticipation of establishing its insight laser center business  invested capital in nos  and opened an ophthalmic lens manufacturing facility 
the company believes that the costs associated with acquiring and establishing these businesses are nonrecurring 
as a result  certain aspects of the company s operations during were not comparable to its operation during income from the company s comparable operations increased by  or  to  for calendar year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to the  decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  as described above  and the net profit generated from the operations of vcc  in the amount of  this increase was offset primarily by the following four factors i the company incurred a  loss from the operation of the benson stores during the fourth quarter of  primarily due to losses generated by the stores the company ultimately closed and the costs incurred in maintaining benson s administrative office and warehouse facilities  which were eventually closed in the first quarter of  ii the company incurred a  loss in establishing the operations of insight  which has yet to generate revenues  although it incurred payroll costs and interest expense with respect to its leasing of five excimer lasers  iii the company incurred a  loss from the operation of nos  including the company s election to write off the  balance of its investment in such entity  and iv the company incurred expenses in the amount of  in connection with the initial operations of its lens manufacturing facility

the term loans are divided into two separate classes or tranches collectively  the tranches 
tranche a was in the original principal amount of  and is being amortized over five years with equal monthly payments of principal

on november   the bank i converted an existing bridge loan  in the principal amount of  into the term loan mentioned above  which will be amortized over the remaining term of the tranches  ii increased the company s line of credit by an additional  of which  was outstanding as of december   and iii extended the maturity date of the line of credit to april  on february   the bank amended the credit agreement as explained below which included  in part  a  payment and permanent reduction in the amount of the line of credit and an extension of the maturity date of such line of credit until may  loans outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at the prime rate in effect from time to time 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  the company must comply with certain financial covenants relating to i the ratio of total assets to total revenues  ii minimum net worth plus subordinated indebtedness  iii the ratio of total unsubordinated liabilities to net worth  iv its current ratio  v its debt service coverage ratio  vi maximum net loss  and vii the ratio of funded debt to net operating cash flow  all as such terms are defined in the credit agreement 
except for the quarter ended march   the company was not in compliance with certain of these financial covenants for the quarters ended june   september  and december   although  in each instance  the company was able to secure a waiver of such non compliance from the bank 
at june   the company was not in compliance with the covenants described in v and vii above  primarily due to the decrease in net income before taxes for the six months ended june  as compared to the same period in  and an increase in the company s then short term debt incurred as a result of the banks issuance of a  letter of credit in connection with the vca transaction  which was completed during the quarter ended june   at september   the company was not in compliance with the covenants described in v and vii above  primarily due to the decrease in net income before taxes for the nine months ended september  as compared to the same period in  and  at december   the company was not in compliance with any of the financial covenants described above primarily due to the net loss before tax provision incurred for the calendar year ended december  unless waived  such defaults would give the bank the right to accelerate the payment of the then outstanding balance under the company s term loans and line of credit 
on november   the company borrowed from each of drs 
robert cohen  alan cohen and edward cohen collectively  the cohen brothers the sum of  each of which loans was for a term of ninety days and bears interest at a rate of above the banks prime rate  in effect  from time to time 
as a condition to the company borrowings such funds  the bank amended the credit agreement which i permitted the company to borrow such funds from the cohen brothers  ii placed additional restrictions on the company s ability to acquire other retail optical chains without the bank s approval  iii expanded the default provisions contained in the credit agreement  and iv placed additional restrictions on the company s ability to sell its excess franchisee promissory notes 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding principal balance of such loans was  on february   the company repaid  of such loams together with the interest accrued to date thereof  and the cohen brothers orally agreed to extend the maturity date of the balance of such loans to may  on february   the company entered into convertible debenture and warrants subscription agreements see note subsequent events with certain investors in connection with the private placement of units consisting of an aggregate of  principal amount of convertible debentures collectively  the debentures and an aggregate of  warrants collectively  the warrants  which warrants entitle the holders thereof to purchase a maximum number of million shares of the company s common stock 
the company intends to use the net proceeds approximately  of the private placement i to repay a  portion of the loans made to it by the cohen brothers as discussed above  together with thereon  in the approximate amount of  ii to pay down the company s revolving line of credit with the bank  iii the balance of such proceeds is intended to be used by the company for general corporate purposes 
the debentures bear no interest and mature on august  in connection with the company s acquisition  which occurred in may  of substantially all of the assets of vca  the company delivered to norwest  the seller  a ninety day direct pay letter of credit  in the amount of  representing the purchase price for such assets  which letter of credit was drawn upon by norwest in the ordinary course of business 
in connection with the ipco acquisition  the company acquired ipco s right to cash collateral and certain franchise promissory notes pledged to  and securing loans made to  ipco and cit 
the residual value of such franchise notes receivable ie  the sums remaining payable on such franchise notes after payment  in full  of the indebtedness owed to cit and sanwa  which obligations were not assumed by the company represent notes acquired from ipco and are currently being held by sanwa and cit as collateral against obligations incurred by ipco 
the indebtedness payable to cit is scheduled to be repaid on or about july  at which time it is anticipated that the cash collateral and franchise notes pledged to cit will be returned to the company 
however  the company s residual value of the cash collateral underlying the franchise notes pledged to cit has been reduced as a result of the application  by cit  of such collateral to offset certain franchisee note forgiveness 
the company s right to the return of the notes pledged to sanwa after payment of the indebtedness incurred by ipco and subject to which the company acquired such notes is the subject of litigation between sanwa and the company 
the company maintains that it is entitled to a return of the franchise notes held by sanwa upon the repayment of the indebtedness owed to sanwa  based upon the advice given to it by its outside counsel 
the residual value of the franchise notes  net of reserves of  held by sanwa and cit as of december  was  and  respectively 
franchise and other accounts receivable increased by  or  to  as of december   as compared to  as of december   due primarily to slower collections of certain amounts owed to the company by a number of its franchisees  as well as an increase in royalties generated by an increase in the number of franchised stores acquired in the vca transaction the company is working with these franchisees in an attempt to obtain collection of outstanding receivables through the following means i restructuring of the repayment of such obligations  or ii if necessary  exercising its rights under the various documents pursuant to which each such franchisee occupies its sterling store  including the possible termination of the applicable franchise agreement 
franchise and other notes receivable as of december  were  which includes approximately  of franchise notes acquired in connection with the vca transaction 
in addition  such amount consists of approximately  of new franchise notes generated from the conveyance of company owned assets to franchisees  and is partially offset by approximately  of principal payments collected during the calendar year ended december  the company believes that the underlying value of the collateral securing its franchise accounts and notes receivable together  in most cases  with the personal guarantees of the principal owners of each of the company s franchised stores  will be sufficient to support the collectibility of these receivables 
inventories at company owned stores decreased by  or  to  as of december   as compared to  as of december  this decrease was due primarily to the conveyance  during the calendar year ended december   of the assets of company owned stores to franchisees 
as of december   insight had leased  with purchase options  six excimer lasers 
aggregate lease payments pursuant to such leases will approximate     and  for the years ended december     and  respectively 
in december   the company completed the offering and raised approximately  net of commissions and expenses  from the sale of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
in january   the company raised approximately  net of commissions and expenses  from the sale of an additional  shares of its common stock at per share pursuant to an over allotment option granted the underwriters in connection with the offering 
as of december  and december   the company had  and  respectively  in working capital  and  and  respectively  of cash and cash equivalents 
as of the date hereof  the company has ceased the construction of any new insight laser centers  including the one in san francisco  california which was anticipated to open during the first quarter of 
during the twelve months ending december   the company anticipates having the following capital requirements renovating of six existing company owned stores  and the continuing upgrade of the company s management information system in conjunction with the pos systems being installed in its company owned stores  in the aggregate  approximate amount of  acquiring retail optical stores  subject to the availability of qualified opportunities and which would require the approval of the bank  in furtherance of the company s business strategy  in amounts that cannot be projected by the company at this time  except for a  loan to be made by sterling in connection with a proposed acquisition see note subsequent events  and opening new retail optical stores in furtherance of the company s business strategy  also in amounts that cannot be projected by the company at this time 
the company experienced negative cash flow during the calendar year ended december  resulting  primarily  from losses attributable to the stores acquired in the benson transaction the benson stores and the operations of insight 
by the end of  the following measures were taken by the company which management believes will reduce the magnitude of the losses it sustained during and improve the company s operations and cash flow in i closing nine benson stores  some of which were unprofitable or where leases for which were not renewed ii franchising eleven benson stores which are currently producing royalty income  iii eliminating virtually all administrative overhead in connection with insight  iv reducing overhead at the company s insight laser center  and v reduced general and administrative expenses  exclusive of those incurred by insight  by approximately  although the company also anticipates a positive cash flow from its retail optical store operations  it nevertheless anticipates that insight will continue to operate at a loss for the twelve months ended december   therefore the company believes that such operating cash flow will be insufficient to result in a positive cash flow for the company for the twelve months ended december  however  in february  the company entered into a convertible debentures and warrants subscription agreement see note subsequent events which provided net proceeds of approximately  to the company 
except for approximately  of such amount  which was utilized to repay a portion of the company s debt  approximately  will be available to the company for general corporate purposes 
although the company believes that its financial condition will improve for the twelve months ended december   the company also anticipates that it may not be in compliance with certain of its existing financial covenants as contained in its credit agreement with the bank 
consequently  the company is required for the calendar year ended december   to reclassify  as a current liability  the long term portion of its debt to the bank 
in the event of a default  the bank has the right to accelerate the payment of the then outstanding principal under the company s term loans and line of credit 
in any event  the line of credit and loans due to the cohen brothers are due to mature on may  and two notes  in connection with the pembridge transaction  are due to mature in august accordingly  the company believes that its current cash resources and cashflow from operations would be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital expenditures in  unless the bank exercises its right to accelerate the repayment of the aforementioned term loans 
further  the credit agreement currently restricts the company s ability to obtain additional financing except in certain circumstances 
however  in the event of such acceleration of such term loans  the company believes it could meet its needs through either additional borrowings  the sale of franchise notes receivable or additional sales of equity  although there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in obtaining any such additional borrowings  selling any of its franchise notes receivable and or selling additional equity  or on what terms such transactions could be effected 
in addition  the company i is currently negotiating with a financial institution to finance its franchise notes receivable  ii is currently negotiating with its creditors to repay that portion of its short term debt  in connection with the pembridge transaction  in stock rather than in cash  iii intends to negotiate with the bank an extension renewal of the maturity date of its line of credit  and iv will request  from the cohen brothers  an extension of time to repay such loans  although there can be no assurance that any of such transactions will be consummated 
impact of inflation and changing prices although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe inflation has had a material effect on results of operations 
recent accounting requirements the company has not completed the process of evaluating the impact that will result from adopting sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilty 
the company is therefore unable to disclose the impact that adopting sfas  will have on its financial position and results of operations when such statement is adopted
