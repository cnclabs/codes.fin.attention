in nareit issued additional guidance for interpretation of the definition of ffo which provides that only depreciation and amortization of real estate assets should be added back to net income in calculating ffo 
at december   the company adopted this interpretation and restated ffo amounts previously reported

ffo  as ffo  as previously effect of currently defined revision defined item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law 
although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  there are certain factors such as general economic conditions  local real estate conditions  or weather conditions that might cause a difference between actual results and those forward looking statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows included in item of this annual report 
results of operations revenues 
the company s revenues come from two primary sources apartment rental income and restaurant rental income 
revenues in were million  an increase of percent over  primarily attributable to the impact of the acquisition of paces village apartments in april paces village generated apartment rental income of million in eight months of revenues in were million  an increase of percent over  again primarily attributable to the impact of apartment acquisitions and continued improvements in apartment operations 
apartment rental income accounted for percent of total revenues in compared to percent and percent in and  respectively  indicative of the company s focus on growth and improvement in apartment operations 
increases in income attributable to apartment operations were offset somewhat by declines in restaurant rental income in and and the creation of a property management subsidiary in may income from company owned apartments increased percent in compared to while these increases are primarily attributable to the acquisition of paces village in april  apartment operations reflect continued improvement 
income from apartments owned for the full year in both and increased by percent in  reflecting a percent decline in average occupancy at these apartments which was more than offset by a percent increase in average rental revenue per occupied unit 
average economic occupancy for the four properties owned for the full year in both and was percent for and percent for  average rental revenue per occupied unit was in and in from its acquisition in april through year end  paces village had average economic occupancy of percent and average revenue per occupied unit of the percent increase in apartment rental income in compared to is primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions of three apartment properties harris hill  latitudes and oakbrook during see discussion of apartment properties included in item of this annual report 
the company owns apartment properties in charlotte  north carolina  greensboro  north carolina  and virginia beach  virginia 
the company s apartments are priced in the moderate to moderately high range for apartments available within these markets 
despite a substantial amount of new construction  especially in charlotte and greensboro  these markets have remained relatively strong 
this strength is primarily attributable to demand for apartments created by continued population and job growth 
the company has experienced a nominal reduction in its average economic occupancy  but average monthly rent has continued to rise at a moderate rate 
while the company expects some continued weakness in its markets through  management does not expect this will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
increases in apartment rental income in and were partially offset by declines in restaurant rental income in those same periods 
in restaurant rental income declined by percent compared to related restaurant food sales declined by percent in the same period 
all stores were open throughout and the difference in restaurant rental revenue and related sales is the result of the minimum rent provision of the restaurant lease 
under the lease  as modified in december  restaurant rental is the greater of minimum rent million per year or percent of food sales 
for the rental was the million minimum rent 
restaurant sales and related rental income have been in decline since  attributed to an increasingly competitive environment in the fast food industry marked by widespread price discounting and the lack of a strong hamburger product on the hardee s menu 
severe weather in january also contributed to the decline 
boddie noell enterprises  inc enterprises  the restaurant operator  and hardee s food systems  the restaurant franchisor  are taking aggressive steps to improve restaurant sales 
this includes a new advertising campaign  the introduction of several new food items and a return to the charbroil cooking method 
there are signs that these actions are beginning to take effect 
during the quarterly sales comparisons to the same periods in were first quarter down percent  second quarter down percent  third quarter down percent  and fourth quarter down percent 
in restaurant rental income declined by percent compared to same store restaurant sales for locations open for the full periods in both years declined by percent for the year 
the difference in trends for rental income and same store sales can be attributed to closings for scheduled remodeling all stores were open throughout 
effective december   the company and enterprises entered into a modified and restated master lease which increased the required minimum rent from million per year to million per year and extended the primary term from may to december the percentage rent remained set at percent of gross food sales 
also offsetting the increase in apartment rental income was the elimination of property management fee income in  reflecting the formation of bnp management  inc management company in may the company accounts for its investment in the management company using the equity method of accounting  and percent of the net income of the management company flows through to the company s financial statements as a single line item 
throughout all third party management activities were conducted by the management company  which currently provides property management services for nine apartment properties and two shopping centers 
equity in the income of this subsidiary totaled approximately  for and  for management fee income earned prior to the formation of the management company totaled  in eight months of and  in three months of management does not expect the formation or operation of the management company to have a significant effect on the financial position  operating results  or cash flows of the company 
expenses 
increases in expenses generally reflect the impact of apartment acquisitions in and along with acquisition of management operations in total expenses in were million  an increase of percent over  primarily attributable to the impact of the acquisition of paces village apartments in april total expenses in were million  an increase of percent over  reflecting a full year s operations of four apartment communities of which three were acquired in and administrative functions 
increases in depreciation and amortization over the three year period are directly attributable to the impact of acquisitions of apartment properties in and and an intangible asset recorded in conjunction with acquisition of management operations in october restaurant rental property million and related depreciation charges  per year were unchanged throughout the three year period  while apartment rental property grew from million at the end of to million by the end of  with related depreciation increasing from approximately  in to approximately  in amortization of the intangible related to management operations totaled  in and  in the balance of amortization expense relates to loan costs 
operating expenses were generally in line with management s expectations 
apartment operations expense totaled percent  percent  and percent of apartment rental income in  and  respectively 
increases in apartment operating expenses are primarily attributable to increased costs associated with attracting and retaining residents in a softening apartment market as well as an increased emphasis on preventative maintenance 
operating expenses relating to restaurant properties are insignificant because of the restaurant properties triple net lease arrangement 
the percent decrease in administrative expense in compared to reflects the impact of transfer of third party property management operations to the management company in these costs declined in the last half of  during the last six months compared to  during the first six months 
the percent increase in administrative expense in compared to reflects the impact of assumption of management activities in october through third quarter of  the company paid property management fees percent of rental revenues collected to btvc for management of its apartment properties and advisory fees percent of net cash available for distribution as defined by the advisory agreement to an affiliate of enterprises 
with the acquisition of btvc  the company terminated its advisory contract and became self advised and self managed  thereby eliminating future property management and advisory fees 
increases in interest expense are primarily attributable to increases in outstanding indebtedness incurred in connection with acquisitions of paces village in million and btvc s management operations  oakbrook  latitudes  and harris hill in million 
during fourth quarter of and second quarter of the company refinanced all variable rate debt related to apartment properties to fixed rate loans  and in december the company refinanced its variable rate credit facility to a fixed rate loan 
with the exception of approximately million in debt related to the paces village acquisition  all notes payable secured by rental properties are at fixed rates 
see further discussion below included in discussion of liquidity and capital resources 
during the fourth quarters of and the company recorded non cash write offs of  and  respectively  related to deferred acquisition costs 
significantly all of these costs arose in and in conjunction with the roll up transaction the company began in and ultimately abandoned in december liquidity and capital resources capitalization 
prior to acquiring its first apartment community  the company s capital requirements were minimal  as all capital expenses related to the restaurants were borne by enterprises under the terms of the master lease 
in order to acquire paces commons  oakbrook  btvc  latitudes  harris hill and paces village  the company incurred additional debt and issued additional common stock 
the additional debt consists of first and second mortgages  secured by the acquired apartment communities  and draws against the company s credit lines 
as the company continues to acquire apartment properties  it is likely that the company will incur additional long term debt and seek additional equity capital 
from its inception in through september the company had  shares of common stock outstanding 
on october   an additional  shares were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of btvc 
during and the company issued a total of  shares of common stock to the former btvc shareholders in conjunction with an earn out provision of that acquisition agreement 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the former btvc shareholders are due additional consideration totaling  shares of common stock valued at  as of december  assuming the full contingent purchase price is earned and paid in common stock  it is anticipated that the company would issue approximately  additional shares of common stock in conjunction with the acquisition including shares earned  but not issued  at december  
in july the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drip plan was amended to allow the company  at its option  to issue shares directly to plan participants 
as amended  the plan provides for optional additional investment by participants of to  previously  per quarter 
during the company issued  shares through the drip plan  including  shares for reinvested dividends and  shares for optional additional investment 
consistent with management s plan to reduce the company s exposure to variable rate debt  during fourth quarter of and second quarter of the company refinanced million in variable rate debt related to apartment properties to fixed rate loans with maturities ranging from through in december the company established a credit line with southtrust bank of alabama in the amount of million at a fixed rate of percent for a term of three years 
the company used an initial draw of million to retire its existing short term variable rate credit facility 
during the company financed the purchase of paces village apartments through variable rate debt totaling million along with a draw of  from its existing credit facility 
in addition  deeds of trust related to two apartment properties were modified to extend the terms of each note by five years 
the balance of the credit line is available for general corporate purposes 
a summary of long term debt as of december  and has been included in the notes to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
at december   total long term debt was million  including million notes payable at fixed interest rates ranging from percent to percent  and million at variable rates 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was percent at december   compared to percent at december  a percent increase in variable interest rates would impact the company by increasing interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis  conversely  a percent decrease in variable interest rates would impact the company by decreasing interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis 
cash flow and liquidity requirements 
funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in nareit issued additional guidance for interpretation of this definition which provides that only depreciation and amortization of real estate assets should be added back to net income in calculating ffo 
at december   the company adopted this interpretation and restated ffo amounts previously reported 
management considers ffo to be useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions and measuring the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs  including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to shareholders 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo 
a reconciliation of net income to ffo is as follows all amounts in thousands net income    depreciation    amortization of management intangible write off of deferred costs funds from operations    funds available for distribution fad is defined by the company as ffo plus non cash expense for amortization of loan costs  less payments for scheduled amortization of debt principal and recurring capital expenditures 
a reconciliation of ffo to fad  along with summary cash flow information  is as follows all amounts in thousands funds from operations    amortization of loan costs scheduled debt principal payments recurring capital expenditures funds available for distribution    net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities    dividends and distributions paid to shareholders    nonrecurring capital expenditures acquisition improvements and replacements other apartment property improvements as discussed above  the addition of apartment properties and improvement in apartment operations have offset the decline in restaurant rental income  producing increases in ffo of percent in and percent in net income for increased by percent compared to this increase is attributable to the fact that during the company recorded write offs totaling  otherwise  net income for compared to would have declined and reflected the effect of depreciation and amortization of assets related to apartment property acquisitions 
as expected  net income declined percent in compared to  reflecting the effect of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of assets related to apartment property acquisitions in and as seen in the past  future additions to the apartment properties portfolio would likely result in a decline in net income due to significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  however  management anticipates that such additions would generate favorable increases in ffo 
the company capitalizes those expenditures relating to acquiring new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset 
in and the company capitalized all carpet and vinyl replacements including  in and  in included in acquisition improvements and replacements 
in apartment carpet and vinyl replacements were generally expensed as incurred  expensed in  except when those replacements were made in conjunction with a plan of acquisition  in included in acquisition improvements and replacements 
additions to apartment properties were generally funded from cash provided by operating activities 
in the company applied million proceeds of new debt to the acquisition of paces village apartments and related loan costs totaling million 
in the company applied million net proceeds of financing transactions to million in acquisition activities and related loan costs 
dividends paid per share remained stable at in  and  while weighted average number of common shares outstanding increased by  or percent  over the three year period 
the company s dividend payout ratio the ratio of dividends paid to ffo on a per share basis was percent in and  and percent in reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that they currently distribute at least percent of their ordinary taxable income as dividends 
the company intends to pay dividends quarterly  expects that these dividends will substantially exceed the percent taxable income test  and anticipates that all dividends will be paid from current ffo 
a summary of scheduled principal payments on long term debt is included in the notes to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
significant scheduled balloon payments include maturities of the company s credit line in december  million outstanding at december   two loans payable to affiliates in may  million  and the note payable secured by a deed of trust for latitudes apartments in january  balloon of approximately million 
the company continues to produce sufficient cash flow to fund its regular dividend and has positioned itself for future growth 
the company generally expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and utilization of credit facilities 
management believes that net cash provided by operations is  and will continue to be  adequate to meet both operating requirements and payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and the long term 
the company anticipates funding its acquisition activities  if any  primarily by using short term credit facilities or secured long term debt 
the company expects to meet certain of its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of short term financing of possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities of the company 
the company believes that it has sufficient resources to meet its short and long term liquidity requirements 
approximately percent of the company s revenue was derived from enterprises payment of rent for the use of the company s restaurant properties 
in addition  enterprises is responsible for all of the costs associated with the maintenance and operations of these properties 
as a result  the financial well being of the company is  to a large extent  dependent on enterprises ability to meet its obligations under the terms of the master lease 
the ability of enterprises to satisfy the requirements of the master lease depends on its liquidity and capital resources 
historically  enterprises has been able to meet its liquidity needs through cash flow generated from operations and through reliance on its credit facility 
enterprises principal line of business is the operation of approximately hardee s restaurants  of which are owned by the company 
the continued decline in its restaurant sales see revenues above has had a material negative impact on enterprises operating cash flow 
management has had extensive discussions with management of enterprises and has reviewed enterprises unaudited financial statements  cash flow analysis  restaurant contribution analysis  sales trend analysis and projections  and believes that enterprises will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its obligations under the master lease and credit facility as well as its general corporate operating needs 
the table below sets forth certain information with respect to the liquidity and capital resources of enterprises 
the information is derived from enterprises unaudited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   available as of march  enterprises is an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes  therefore  its cash flow generated from operations does not include a deduction for corporate income tax payments 
current assets  total assets  current liabilities  total debt  including current portion of   shareholders equity  net cash provided by operating activities  inflation 
management does not believe that inflation poses a material risk to the company 
the leases at the company s apartment properties are short term in nature  generally for terms of one year or less  with none longer than two years 
the restaurant properties are leased on a triple net basis  which places the risk of rising operating and maintenance costs on the lessee 
environmental matters 
phase i environmental studies performed on the company s apartment properties did not identify any problems that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
environmental transaction screens obtained for each of the restaurant properties in did not indicate existence of any environmental problems that warranted further investigation 
enterprises has indemnified the company for environmental problems associated with the restaurant properties under its master lease with the company
