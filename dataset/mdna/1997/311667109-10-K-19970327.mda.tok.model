item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal management believes the company operates in markets which are extremely competitive  and to some extent  affected by continuing after effects of recessions in the capital goods markets in western europe  as well as ongoing political and economic uncertainty in eastern europe and the middle east 
far eastern markets remain particularly competitive and difficult to penetrate 
many rubber and plastic manufacturers also continue to operate at less than full capacity 
the timing of receipt of customer orders will also impact the relative level of shipments in any financial reporting period 
management is encouraged by the recent improvement in the level of order intake and backlog  as discussed later 
it does  however  anticipate that the markets served by the company s products will remain extremely competitive and that those markets characterized by economic and political uncertainty will likely continue to be affected by such conditions 
gross margin was million in compared to the million generated in the percentage also declined in to percent from percent in the year to year comparison is attributed to the mix of products sold  which can differ significantly from one period to the next  and to continued stiff competition 
in addition  management has elected to pursue certain machinery rebuild markets more aggressively to increase market share  and has accepted lower margins in the near term to do so 
the market conditions discussed above continue to exert significant pressure on the level of margin percentage achieved  a trend which is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
in an effort to compensate for the significant pressure on margins  management has taken several measures to aggressively control costs in recent years including the consolidation of component manufacturing into the company s uk plant during the company s uk plant was selected for this cost effective consolidation into a single facility due to its more modern equipment and its greater supply of readily available skilled labor 
assembly operations continue to be performed in both the united states and the united kingdom 
the company has also reduced its worldwide workforce by roughly one third since becoming a public company in in addition  early in the company announced it will consolidate its domestic assembly  repair and spare parts operations  currently in two facilities in connecticut  to available space in one facility during the objective of the consolidation is to reduce operating costs and enhance efficiencies 
the cost of this project is expected to be between million and million  which includes expenditures to be capitalized and expensed as incurred 
company employees will be utilized in this project to the fullest extent possible to minimize the cost of the consolidation 
work is planned to be performed during periods which minimizes interference with production 
whether cost savings actually result from this consolidation  and the size of such savings  cannot be predicted with any certainty 
this consolidation will make the company s derby facility available for sale or lease 
whether this facility can be sold or leased  when it might be sold or leased  and the proceeds which might be realized cannot be predicted with any certainty 
the company has transferred the remaining book value of this facility and any remaining assets no longer anticipated to be used from property  plant  and equipment to other assets at the end of no loss on the disposal of the assets is anticipated at this time  and  as a result  no provision for loss has been made 
it is possible that proceeds actually received from the disposal of these assets may be less than the remaining book value in the near term  at which point in time a loss will be recorded 
the recoverability of these assets will be evaluated periodically as required by fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
page of total operating expenses were reduced approximately 
million to million in compared to million in savings were generated in all three categories of operating costs largely due to the elimination of selected executive and staff positions worldwide 
the reduction in selling expenses also reflects the consolidation of the company s marketing offices in continental europe to england 
administrative costs in included 
million of third party costs which were deferred in prior years in connection with efforts  ultimately unsuccessful  to identify  negotiate  and contract with several acquisition candidates  primarily outside the united states 
this non recurring write off of previously deferred costs has largely offset the other savings previously discussed 
no further costs were deferred during the income tax rate  as a percentage of pre tax income  was compared to in the relatively low rate is attributed to the combination of the pre tax loss in the united states and taxable income in the united kingdom 
the company provides for income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it pays income taxes at the statutory rates in effect in each jurisdiction adjusted for differences in providing for income taxes between financial reporting and income tax purposes 
material contingencies as described more fully in part  item  the company and black decker entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which black decker agreed to assume full responsibility for the investigation and remediation of any pre may  environmental contamination at the company s ansonia and derby facilities as required by the connecticut department of environmental protection dep 
as part of the settlement  the company transferred by quit claim deed a vacant surfaced parking lot to the city of ansonia 
as required by the settlement agreement  a preliminary environmental assessment of the company s properties in ansonia and derby  connecticut has been conducted by black decker 
on the basis of the preliminary data now available there is no reason to believe that any remediation activities which might be required as a result of the findings of the assessment will have a material effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or the competitive position of the company 
this forward looking statement could  however  be influenced by the results of any further investigation which the dep might require  by dep s conclusions and requirements based upon its review of complete information when such is available  unanticipated discoveries  the possibility that new or different environmental laws might be adopted and the possibility that further regulatory review or litigation might become necessary or appropriate 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
management believed this moderate increase in net sales  while positive  reflected the impact of extremely competitive conditions in the markets served by the company s products  by many of the company s competitors 
it further believed that the company operated in markets influenced  at least to some extent  by after effects of recessions in the united states and western europe  as well as ongoing political and economic instability in eastern europe and the middle east 
far eastern markets were extremely competitive and difficult to penetrate 
business potential in the largest far eastern market  the people s republic of china  had been severely restricted by internal economic controls 
gross margin of million in was approximately the same as the million in the margin percentage  however  declined in to percent compared to percent in the decline in percentage was partially attributed to the mix of products sold during each period and to intense competition and to continuing recessionary pressures  as previously mentioned 
the margin also included a benefit of approximately 
million from settling a dispute with a third party 
page of operating expenses  in total  increased approximately 
million to million in compared to this increase was largely attributed to increased sales and marketing efforts by the company around the world 
the company had capitalized approximately 
million and 
million of third party costs as of december  and  respectively 
these costs were incurred to identify  negotiate and contract with several acquisition candidates  primarily outside the united states 
it is possible that efforts related to individual acquisition candidates may prove unsuccessful in the near term  at which point in time the capitalized costs would be charged to current operations 
other income  net of other expense  of million in primarily reflected the elimination of postretirement medical benefits for future retirees under the renegotiated contract with domestic union employees 
this eliminated approximately million of the obligation previously recorded by the company in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the were no individually significant items included in other income or expense in the income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was compared to in orders and backlog orders received by the company during increased approximately million  or roughly  to approximately million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in orders compared to is distributed across product lines and geographically around the world with the largest regional increase occurring in the far east  despite the competitive challenges of penetrating that area of the world 
in the case of major equipment orders  up to twelve months are required to complete the manufacturing process 
accordingly  revenues reported in the statement of operations may represent orders received in the current or previous quarters during which economic conditions had been severely depressed in various geographic markets of the world 
further  the cyclical nature of industry demand and  therefore  the timing of order intake may effect the company s quarterly results in the current and future fiscal quarters 
the company s ability to maintain and increase net sales depends upon a strengthening and stability in the company s traditional markets 
there can be no assurance that the level of orders experienced in will continue  or that improvements in the company s traditional markets will lead to increased orders for the company s products 
the level of backlog considered firm by management at december  is million and is largely attributed to the increase in orders in compared to backlog at december  was million 
the contractual ship dates for substantially all of the december  backlog are in the backlog at march  and was million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures working capital and the working capital ratio at december  were million and to  respectively  compared to million and to at december   respectively 
the company paid a dividend of per share in the first quarter of the company s ability to pay dividends in the future is limited under the credit facility described below to the aggregate of a of net income during the most recently completed four fiscal quarters after deducting distributions previously made and b purchases by the company of its common stock during the same period 
due to the nature of the company s business  many sales are of a large dollar amount 
consequently  accounts receivable and or inventory may be at high levels from time to time resulting in a temporary decline in cash provided from operating activities 
historically  the company has not experienced significant problems regarding the collection of accounts receivable 
the company has historically financed its operations with cash generated by operations  with customer progress payments and borrowings under its bank credit facilities 
page of the company has a worldwide multi currency credit facility with a major us bank in an amount of million for direct borrowings and letters of credit and up to million for foreign exchange contracts 
interest varies based upon prevailing market interest rates 
the facility contains limits on direct borrowings and letters of credit combined based upon stipulated levels of accounts receivable  inventory and backlog 
the facility also contains covenants specifying minimum and maximum thresholds for operating results and selected financial ratios 
there were no direct borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  or there were million and million in letters of credit outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the company s cash balances remained relatively stable during fiscal management anticipates that its cash balances  operating cash flows and available credit line will be adequate to fund its anticipated capital commitments and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months including completion of the company s consolidation of assembly  repair and spare parts operations into one facility in connecticut and the expansion of its houston facility 
the company made capital expenditures of approximately million and million  during fiscal and  respectively 
the reduction in capital expenditures in is largely attributed to the completion of the certain improvements made to the company s manufacturing facilities and process laboratories which occurred in safe harbor statements under private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in the company s public documents  including in this report and in particular  in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may be forward looking and may be subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following pricing pressures from competitors and or customers continued economic and political uncertainty in certain of the company s markets the company s ability to maintain and increase gross margin levels the company s ability to generate positive cash other factors which might be described from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission changes in business conditions  in general  and  in particular  in the businesses of the company s customers and competitors
