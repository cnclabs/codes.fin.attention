the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview intelliquest is a leading provider of information  technologies  and analysis services that are designed to improve the marketing performance of technology companies 
the company also licenses custom proprietary software applications and associated services to technology manufacturers for customer registration 
in  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from continuous services and from the sale of proprietary project research and conferences 
see business products and services 
the company was founded in to provide fee for service project research on united states technology markets 
prior to  the company focused on conducting proprietary research for a limited number of technology companies 
in order to better leverage its expertise  expand its customer base and capitalize on the growing need for international market research  the company in began to increase its focus on providing renewable subscription based and renewable proprietary products and on expanding its research coverage to include key international technology markets 
in may  the company acquired intelliquest communications  a leading provider of electronic customer registration services 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests  as such  the company s results of operations for all periods and financial condition for all dates disclosed herein have been restated to include those of intelliquest communications 
due primarily to the company s strategic decision to substantially increase its emphasis on worldwide renewable products and services  and to a lesser extent to the company s acquisition of intelliquest communications  the company s total revenues increased from million in to million in revenues from continuous services increased from million in  or of total revenues  to million in  or of total revenues 
revenues from international market research  which the company first introduced in  grew to million in  or of total revenues 
overall  the number of customers for the company s products and services increased from in to in the company s continuous services are composed of renewable subscription based products as well as renewable proprietary products 
the company s renewable subscription based product revenues are derived substantially from three product families intellitrack iq  world wide internet tracking study wwits  and the computer industry media study cims 
intellitrack iq is a collection of fourteen distinct product modules covering a variety of technologies and geographic markets 
wwits is a quarterly study that measures size and growth information on internet and on line markets 
this study targets all relevant customer segments including non users as well as users 
payments for intellitrack iq and wwits contracts are generally made in advance of the subscription period or on a quarterly basis  and revenues are recognized pro rata over the period of the contract 
cims is an annual study that measures the readership and viewership habits of technology purchase influencers 
cims subscribers generally pay in advance and upon delivery of the final study 
substantially all cims revenues and related costs are recognized upon delivery of the final study  which typically occurs in the third quarter 
the company s renewable proprietary product revenues typically consist of revenues from proprietary recurring tracking studies and customer information products 
the proprietary recurring tracking studies provide the customer with longitudinal information for tracking designated metrics over a continuous period of time 
revenues from the customer information products are derived from a variety of sources  including proprietary customer registration products and proprietary customer satisfaction products 
renewable customer information revenues include data medium sales  processing fees and reporting fees 
these renewable proprietary products are furnished pursuant to contracts that are generally renewable annually and provide various payment terms including in advance and upon delivery  periodic units shipped processed  percentage of completion and advance deposits 
revenues for renewable proprietary products are recognized on a percentage of completion and actual units shipped processed basis 
the company s other services are composed of proprietary research and conferences 
traditional proprietary project research provides customized information to customers utilizing a variety of proprietary models  research techniques and data collection methods and typically lasts three to twelve months from start to completion 
the company is increasingly emphasizing proprietary research based on the intelliquest technology panel  which is both more timely and less costly than traditional proprietary project research and also allows the company to leverage a fixed investment in panel recruitment over several projects 
most proprietary projects are billed in advance and upon delivery 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the company hosts various conferences which provide a forum for presentation and discussion of technology related issues 
revenue for conferences is recognized in the period which the conference takes place 
attendee and sponsorship fees are typically paid in advance 
the company s exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations has been relatively low 
first  the company generally requires payment from its customers in us dollars 
second  the company controls vendor related foreign currency risk both through contractual clauses requiring clients to reimburse the company for any material losses on contracts caused by exchange rate fluctuations and by locking in forward currency contracts for vendor purchases 
these forward contracts substantially eliminate the company s exposure to exchange rate fluctuation risk by giving the company the right to purchase the required amount of foreign currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the time the contract is entered into rather than at the time the payments are due 
as of december   the company had entered into open forward contracts for us dollar british pound sterling transactions with a notional value of approximately million 
in recent years  the company has focused on increasing operating margins by leveraging fixed overhead costs and investments in new products and proprietary processes 
each subscription based product has a fixed annual cost associated with data collection and product development  with only nominal costs associated with adding incremental subscribers 
the customer information products also have fixed overhead components  although a significant increase in product registration revenues could actually decrease the company s overall gross margin due to the high level of direct costs associated with product registration  while increasing the company s operating margin 
in march  the company completed its initial public offering at a price of per share  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of million 
upon the closing of the initial public offering  each outstanding share of the company s series a and series b redeemable convertible preferred stock was automatically converted into one share of common stock 
in october  the company completed a follow on public offering at a price of per share  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of million

years ended december  and december  total revenues 
total revenues increased in to million from million in revenues from continuous services increased to million in from million in due primarily to the execution and new sales of customer information products as well as increased demand for proprietary tracking products and the increased number of subscribers for the three subscription based product families 
other revenues increased to million in from million in  due primarily to growth of the company s technology panel research 
revenues attributable to international market research increased to million in from million in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in cost of revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues reflects the company s efforts to leverage its fixed labor costs through its investments in new products and proprietary processes 
the company s development and expansion of subscription based products allow the company to sell substantially similar products to a greater number of clients  thus increasing revenues without similarly increasing cost of revenues 
furthermore  the company s improvements in its proprietary processes including more consistently applied research methodologies and faster and more accurate data processing reduce the costs of research and data processing 
sales  general and administrative expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and other costs associated with sales  marketing  administration  finance  information systems  human resources and general management 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million of total revenues during from million of total revenues during the increase was a result of several items including additional expenses associated with becoming a public company and the acquisition of intelliquest communications as well as expansion of the company s sales and marketing departments and its united kingdom facilities 
acquisition costs expensed during were  the decrease as a percentage of total sales was primarily due to the company s ability to leverage its fixed costs over a higher revenue base 
the company anticipates that sales  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue will increase in future periods due to its expansion of sales and marketing efforts 
product development expenses 
product development expenses are composed of resources  primarily labor and data collection charges  dedicated to the development of new products and proprietary processes 
product development expenses increased to million during from million during  an increase 
the increase was due to the company s increased development efforts on internet related products 
due to the fact that the company competes in a market characterized by rapid and continual technological change  it anticipates adding new products and services which address the increasingly sophisticated  rapidly changing and demanding needs of its customers and their evolving market strategies 
as a result of the uncertainty of these market demands  future product development expenses may fluctuate 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from  during to  during this increase was due to a high level of capital equipment acquisitions including establishing two new data collection facilities and installation of corporate wide standardized computer platforms  networks and software to accommodate more efficient data communications 
income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes represents and of income before income taxes for and  respectively 
the rate is below the company s combined federal and state income tax rates due to a combination of two factors 
the net proceeds from the company s initial and follow on public offerings in have typically been invested in tax free instruments and the company had not recorded any income tax benefit prior to resulting from operating losses generated by intelliquest communications 
years ended december  and december  total revenues 
total revenues increased in to million from million in revenues from continuous services increased in to million from million in due primarily to increased sales of customer information products and to increased demand for international proprietary tracking products as well as the increased number of new subscribers  the higher number of products sold per subscriber and revenues related to new international markets covered 
other revenues decreased to million in from million in due primarily to the company s continuing emphasis on continuous services 
revenues attributable to international market research increased to million in from million in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in cost of revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues reflects the company s efforts to leverage its fixed labor costs through its investments in new products and proprietary processes 
the company s development and expansion of subscription based products allow the company to sell substantially similar products to a greater number of clients  thus increasing revenues without similarly increasing cost of revenues 
for example  the release of cims did not require the same level of investment per customer as the release  resulting in improved margins 
similarly  intellitrack s cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues were lower in than in when the company expanded intellitrack to cover a number of international markets 
furthermore  the company s improvements in its proprietary processes including more consistently applied research methodologies and faster and more accurate data processing reduce the costs of research and data processing 
sales  general and administrative expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in but remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenues at and in and  respectively 
the aggregate increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits as well as intelliquest communications advertising costs and legal expenses associated with finalization of certain employee and vendor contracts 
in addition  the company incurred sales  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of of  to open its london and college station  texas offices 
product development expenses 
product development expenses increased to million in from million in but decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in  respectively 
the aggregate increase was due to the company s efforts to expand the technology panel  streamline proprietary software and enabling technologies and provide technological advancements to customers 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in from  in this increase was principally due to computer equipment purchases to improve communications and data processing systems required to support business growth and international expansion 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for the rate was in excess of the combined federal and state statutory rates because the company did not recognize any income tax benefit resulting from the net loss of intelliquest communications 
the provision for income taxes of  for resulted principally from not recognizing any income tax benefit for the net loss of intelliquest communications

liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash of  and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
during the twelve months ended december   the company generated  of cash from operations as compared to  during the prior year 
the decrease in cash flow from operations is due to a combination of offsetting factors 
although the company s increased earnings provided an increase in cash flow  an increase in its accounts receivable  which resulted from typical billing activity as discussed below  caused an offsetting decrease in cash flow 
the company generated  of cash from operations for the year ended december  as compared to  of cash from operations for the prior year 
this increase in cash flow from operations was the result of the company s leveraging of its subscription based products  returns from investments in customer information products and a prepayment for services on a certain contract received by the company during pursuant to the billing terms between the company and its customers  the company typically bills customers for products or projects before they have been delivered 
billed amounts are recorded as deferred revenues on the company s financial statements and are recognized as income when earned 
as of december  and  the company had million and million of deferred revenues  respectively 
in addition  when work is performed in advance of billing  the company will record this work as unbilled revenue 
as of december  and  the company had million and million of unbilled revenues  respectively 
substantially all deferred and unbilled revenues will be earned and billed  respectively  within months of the respective period ends 
for the years ended december  and  net cash used in investing activities was million and  respectively 
this increase in cash used was primarily due to the company s investment of the net proceeds from its initial and follow on public offerings that closed in march and october  respectively  in short term investments 
the increase also results from the relatively high level of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvement expenditures during resulting from the establishment and expansion of new data collection facilities and installation of corporate wide standardized computer platforms  networks and software to accommodate more efficient data communications 
the company anticipates emphasizing investments in internally developed software and data analysis products in net cash used in investing activities increased to  from  for the years ended december  and december   respectively  primarily for the purchases of furniture  equipment  computers and related software for use by the company s employees 
equipment and leasehold purchases in these years were approximately  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   approximately  of this amount was used in connection with the opening of offices in london and college station  texas 
the company expects to make additional purchases of equipment as necessary to accommodate future growth  if any 
the company periodically considers acquisitions of companies that provide products or services not offered by the company  have strategic customer relationships  are located in attractive geographic locations or have proprietary technologies 
the company may undertake such acquisitions during at present  however  it has no commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition other than its acquisition of zona research during february financing activities provided cash of  during fiscal and million during fiscal the increased cash flow was generated by net proceeds from the company s initial and follow on public offerings that closed in march and october  respectively 
the company maintains a million revolving bank line of credit to fund cash requirements from time to time 
borrowings under such line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate and are subject to compliance by the company with certain financial covenants 
at december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants and there was  outstanding under such line of credit 
the line of credit matures on november  the company believes that the cash flows from operations  together with existing cash balances  short term investments and the line of credit  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
beyond that time  if cash flows from operations and available borrowing under the line of credit are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  the company may seek additional funding through the sale of its securities  including equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such funding can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
risk factors reliance on key customers  technology industry consolidation 
the company has relied on a limited number of key customers for the majority of its revenues 
the company s largest customers in  and generated  and  respectively  of the company s revenues in each of those periods 
in  the company s two largest customers  ibm and microsoft  each accounted for over of the company s revenues and together accounted for of revenues 
the company expects that these two customers will each account for over of revenues in as well 
substantially all of the company s subscriptions and customer contracts are renewable annually at the option of the company s customers  although no obligation to renew exists and a customer generally has no minimum purchase commitments thereunder 
in addition  there is significant consolidation of companies in the technology industries served by the company  a trend which the company believes will continue 
consolidation among the company s top customers could adversely affect aggregate customer budgets for the company s products and services 
no assurances can be given that the company will maintain its existing customer base or that it will be able to attract new customers 
the loss of one or more of the company s large customers or a significant reduction in business from such customers  regardless of the reason  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
see business customers and sales and marketing 
dependence on subscription and contract renewals 
in  of the company s revenues were derived from subscriptions to the company s renewable subscription based products and contracts for renewable proprietary products 
the company expects that a material portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future will continue to be derived from such subscriptions and contracts 
substantially all such subscriptions and customer contracts are renewable annually at the option of the company s customers  although no obligation to renew exists and a customer generally has no minimum purchase commitments thereunder 
to the extent that customers fail to renew or defer their renewals from the quarter anticipated by the company  the company s quarterly results may be materially adversely affected 
the company s ability to secure renewals is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to deliver consistent  high quality and timely data 
in addition  the marketing and market research activities of the company s customers are dependent on the timing of their new product introductions  size of marketing budgets  operating performance  industry and economic conditions and changes in management or ownership 
as a result of such factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its historically high renewal rates 
any material decline in renewal rates from such levels would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
see business sales and marketing 
fluctuations in operating results  seasonality 
the company s operating results in any particular fiscal period have fluctuated in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly in the future due to various factors 
substantially all revenues and expenses attributable to the company s computer industry media study cims product for a particular year are recognized when the final study is completed and delivered  usually in the third quarter of that year 
delay in delivering the final study in any given year could postpone recognition of such revenues and expenses until the fourth quarter of such year  which would materially affect operating results for such third and fourth quarters 
furthermore  all costs related to cims are included in cost of revenues and none are allocated to sales  general and administrative costs  which tends to reduce the company s third quarter gross margin below that of other quarters 
many of the company s customers operate in industry segments that are becoming increasingly seasonal as technology vendors have increased their focus on consumer markets  with sales in the fourth calendar quarter constituting a growing portion of the annual sales of such customers 
this may translate into seasonal demand for the company s products  particularly the customer information products 
in addition  the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of orders from customers  the size and timing of orders for customer information products  response rates on customer information products  delays in development and customer acceptance of custom software applications  product or panel development expenses  new product or service introductions or announcements by the company or its competitors  levels of market acceptance for new products and services  the hiring and training of additional staff and customer demand for market research  as well as general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of the company s overhead is fixed in the short term and because spending commitments must be made in advance of revenue commitments by customers  the company s results of operations may be materially adversely affected in any particular quarter if revenues fall below the company s expectations 
these factors  among others  make it likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
competition 
overall  the technology focused market research industry is highly competitive 
the company has traditionally competed directly with relatively small  local providers of survey based technology focused market research 
the company also competes directly with third party providers of customer information software such as kao infosystems company as well as vendors own customer information software 
in addition  the company competes indirectly with significant providers of i analyst based  technology focused market research such as gartner group  inc  meta group  inc 
and forrester research  inc  ii survey based  general market research such as ac nielsen company  nfo research  inc  information resources inc 
and the npd group  inc  and iii analyst based  general business consulting 
although only a few of these competitors have to date offered survey based  technology focused market research that competes directly with the company s products and services  most of these competitors have substantially greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than the company and could decide to increase their resource commitments to the company s market 
moreover  each of these companies currently competes indirectly  if not directly  for funds available within aggregate industry wide market research budgets 
there are few barriers to entry into the company s market  and the company expects increased competition in one or more market segments addressed by the company  which could adversely affect the company s operating results through pricing pressure  required increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share  among other factors 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors 
see business competition 
rapid technological change and new product introduction 
the company s customers compete in markets characterized by rapid  continual technological change 
the company s success will depend in part upon its ability to anticipate and keep pace with rapidly changing technology and to add new products and services which address the increasingly sophisticated  rapidly changing and demanding needs of its customers and their evolving market strategies 
in particular  the company is expending significant resources to develop its proprietary customer information products to take advantage of certain market opportunities 
however  such software products may contain defects following customization or when new versions are released  the company has in the past discovered software defects in certain of its products and may experience delays or lost revenue to correct such defects in the future 
in addition  the significant growth in the use of the world wide web has created the opportunity to use the internet as an information transmission medium 
accordingly  the company is expending significant resources to develop internet based information collection tools 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis  these or other new or improved products and services that adequately and competitively address the needs of the marketplace 
any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely data in a manner that meets rapidly changing market needs could materially and adversely affect the company s future operating results 
see business products and services and product development and technology 
data collection risks 
the company currently collects information both telephonically and electronically 
in addition  certain of the company s new products and services involve the use of the internet and commercial online services to gather information from end users for processing and sale to customers of the company 
a number of legislative initiatives exist domestically and abroad that seek to regulate the telephonic or electronic collection of data about persons 
in addition  an increasing number of court cases have been brought seeking damages and injunctive relief for actions allegedly violating so called rights of privacy 
the law in this area  both statutory and case law  is highly unsettled 
no assurance can be given  therefore  that the company will be allowed to continue to pursue existing or proposed new products and services 
in addition  the company s ability to provide timely and accurate market research to its customers depends on its ability to collect large quantities of high quality data through interviews  customer registrations  product satisfaction questionnaires and certain other surveys 
if receptivity to the company s customer registration  interview and survey methods by respondents declines  or for some other reason their willingness to complete and return surveys  registrations  or other information declines  or if the company for any reason cannot rely on the integrity of the data it receives  it would reduce the quantity and or quality of the data the company seeks to disseminate and would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to market and sell its market research products and on its results of operations 
see business products and services 
risks related to cims 
cims is one of the leading databases of media readership and viewership habits of both business and household technology purchase influencers in the united states 
because many advertisers use cims data as a key component in their media buying decisions and because many media companies use cims data to promote their media properties  such data can have a significant impact on advertiser demand for  and advertising rates charged by  such media properties 
in the past  it has not been unusual for media companies with properties that have not performed well in the studies to be dissatisfied with the results of the studies or the manner in which such results have been used by their competitors 
furthermore  the company in revised data from a study that was inaccurate due to software defects  which it remedied and disclosed to its customers 
although neither media company dissatisfaction nor the inaccurate study has resulted in litigation against the company  there can be no assurance that the company will not face future litigation as a result of media company dissatisfaction with cims or the results thereof  and if initiated  that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
management of growth  possible acquisitions 
since inception  the company s growth has placed significant demands on the company s management  administrative  operational and financial resources 
in order to manage its growth  the company will need to continue to implement and improve its operational  financial and management information systems and continue to expand  motivate and effectively manage an evolving and expanding workforce 
if the company s management is unable to effectively manage under such circumstances  the quality of the company s products  its ability to retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s business will continue to expand 
the company s growth could be adversely affected by reductions in customers spending on market research or customer information products  increased competition  possible pricing pressures and other general economic trends 
although market research expenditures by technology companies have increased in recent years as such companies have adopted certain marketing strategies traditionally utilized by consumer goods manufacturers  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that technology companies will continue to rely on externally generated market research to enhance the marketing of their products 
the company hopes to achieve a portion of its future revenue growth  if any  through acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  although the company currently has no commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
as part of this strategy  the company acquired intelliquest communications in may and zona research in february the company s management has limited experience dealing with the issues of product  systems  personnel and business strategy integration posed by acquisitions  and no assurance can be given that the integration of the intelliquest communications acquisition  the zona research acquisition  or any possible future acquisitions will be managed without a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any possible future acquisition will not dilute the company s earnings per share 
see business growth strategy 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of key personnel who have expertise in developing  interpreting and selling survey based information for technology markets 
although customer relationships are managed at many levels in the company  the loss of one or more of intelliquest s corporate officers or senior managers could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s success may also depend on its ability to hire  train and retain skilled personnel in all areas of its business 
competition for qualified personnel in the company s industry is intense  and many of the companies with which the company competes for qualified personnel have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
furthermore  competition for qualified personnel can be expected to become more intense as competition in the company s industry increases 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel to compete successfully 
expansion of direct sales force 
the company has historically relied on customer referrals  supplemented by its own sales and marketing efforts  to generate the majority of its revenue growth 
although the company has a small number of dedicated account representatives  it only recently began to develop a formal sales management structure 
as the company develops new products and services targeted at broader based market segments  it intends to continue to expand its sales force 
the company s plans for future growth may depend in part on  among other things  its unproven ability to hire  train  deploy  manage and retain an increasingly large direct sales force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop or manage such a sales force 
see business sales and marketing 
history of net losses  uncertain profitability 
the company incurred net losses in each year from through before recording a net profit in each of and as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately  in view of the company s prior operating history  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that it will be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods 
limited protection of proprietary systems  software and procedures 
the company s success is in part dependent upon its proprietary software technology  research methods  data analysis techniques  and internal systems and procedures that it has developed specifically to serve customers in the technology industry 
the company has no patents  consequently  it relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and employee and third party non disclosure agreements to protect its proprietary systems  software and procedures 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior systems  software or procedures 
the company believes that its systems  software and procedures and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into materially adverse license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of such claims 
see business intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
risks associated with international operations 
revenues attributable to international market research represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenues for  and the company expects that revenues from international market research will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues and intends to continue to expand its international market research efforts 
however  the company s international data collection operations are subject to numerous inherent challenges and risks  including maintenance of an international data collection network that adheres to the company s quality standards  fluctuations in exchange rates  foreign political and economic conditions  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  demand for the company s international market research depends on the international sales and operations of its customers  which may increase or decrease over time 
the addition of market research coverage in new geographic territories can be expected to require the commitment of considerable management and financial resources and may negatively impact the company s near term results of operations 
any material decline in the company s ability to provide and market timely  high quality data that is consistent across international markets would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations
