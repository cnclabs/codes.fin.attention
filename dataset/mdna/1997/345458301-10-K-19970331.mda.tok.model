item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview since its organization in june  the company has been engaged principally in oil exploration in the great basin and range of nevada  an area that management believes is one of the most promising unexplored onshore domestic areas with potential for the discovery of major oil reserves 
in continuing to advance this exploration  the company s strategy is to generate exploration prospects with the most recent generally available scientific techniques  expand and improve the company s strategic land position  and establish arrangements with other oil exploration firms active in nevada to obtain additional scientific data  leases  and funding 
until  the company had only limited revenue  consisting of modest amounts of interest income earned on net proceeds from the sale of securities and revenue from producing properties 
in order to supplement its own exploration efforts  between and  the company acquired certain leases and properties in railroad valley  nevada  including the eagle springs field  and  in the eagle springs field  reworked and returned to production eleven acquired wells  drilled a new water injection well  drilled and placed into production eight additional wells  replaced and improved surface equipment to handle increased production and to lower long term operating costs  and undertook a d seismic evaluation program 
these efforts were funded in part between august and november  by barrett  which then held a working interest in the field 
in november  the company utilized proceeds from the sale of securities and its newly established bank credit facility to purchase barrett s working interest in the eagle springs field for approximately million  effective august  the eagle springs field has been the company s principal producing property since during  the company s production and reserves increased substantially as a result of its discovery of the ghost ranch field  in which it holds a working interest 
the company s reserves were also increased due to higher prices in and the company s acquisition of barrett s working interest in the eagle springs field 
the company s activities during the first half of were restricted due to shortages of working capital and cash  as a result of the failure of a financing planned for late to be completed 
this forced the company to implement certain cost containment measures and defer planned exploration and development 
following the receipt of net proceeds from the sale of securities  the company was able to resume its planned exploration and development program in nevada by the third fiscal quarter of to date  the company has funded its exploration and development program principally from the sale of its equity securities 
the company also benefits from capital provided by oil industry participants for drilling and other exploration and development of certain oil prospects through joint arrangements typical in the oil industry 
during  the company also obtained funds through a newly established bank credit facility 
the company s net daily oil production has increased significantly during recent months as newly drilled ghost ranch field wells commenced production  the first in the fourth quarter of and the second in the first quarter of  and following the purchase of barrett s interest in the eagle springs field in november 
based on current production and oil prices  the company s production revenue is now sufficient to meet its current fixed and recurring administrative  operating  and property maintenance costs 
however  production from current wells is inadequate to contribute substantially to costs of exploration 
there can be no assurance  however  that ongoing oil production in commercial quantities will continue  that oil prices will not decrease dramatically  or that additional oil reserves will be proved as a result of the company s exploration efforts 
the auditor s report on the financial statements of the company as of december   contains a qualification as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern because of its continuing losses from operations 
as discussed below  the company believes that its working capital as of december   of  together with cash expected to be provided from operations and from the  remaining available under the company s bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for  without relying on the receipt of additional revenues from development wells expected to be drilled during the year 
results of operations and oil sales increased  or  to  in as compared to  consisting principally of a  increase in eagle springs field revenue  including  from the purchase of barrett s working interest in the field on november   effective august   and  in revenue from the newly discovered ghost ranch well 
the increase in total oil revenue was the result of increases of in barrels produced and in the average sales price of oil 
subsequent to december   oil prices have declined  but total barrels produced continued to increase as an additional ghost ranch well began production 
operating and well service revenue decreased  or  to  in as compared to  due to the purchase of barrett s interest in the eagle springs field 
other income during decreased  or  to  as compared to  because of reduced equipment rental and reduced sales of equipment inventory 
oil and gas production costs for increased  or  reflecting the general increase in production during however  per barrel production expense declined per barrel  or  to in  as compared to per barrel in  as a result of the spread of fixed production costs over an increased number of barrels produced  utilizing previous excess field operations capacity 
oil and gas exploration costs increased  or  to  in as compared to a year earlier as a result of the company s increased exploration activity  particularly during the latter half of during  dry hole  abandonment  and impairment costs increased  or  to  as compared to  again reflecting the company s increased exploration activity during this item includes  in expenses during for test wells that were plugged and abandoned as well as an impairment charge of   of which was a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses were approximately equal for and  during early  the company implemented certain cost containment measures due to temporary shortages of working capital and in the last part of increased its general and administrative resources to manage increased activities following the receipt of proceeds from the sales of securities during the year 
shareholder investor services increased  or over four fold  during to  as compared to this increase relates to repositioning the company in the investment community in connection with the three to one reverse stock split effected june   the engagement of investor relations advisors  and the preparation and publication of company information 
of such amount   is a non cash expense resulting from the promulgation of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect that such expenditures in similar amounts will continue 
during  for the first time in any of the three most recent fiscal years  the company recognized expenses for the issuance of options with an exercise price below market as of the date of grant for a total of  depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased  or in  to  as compared to the previous year 
the decrease was due principally to unusually high depletion recognized in which related to a marginal property with relatively high costs and increased reserves in  which were the result of the discovery of the ghost ranch field and generally higher oil prices during during  net loss was increased by dividends of  related to preferred stock outstanding during the year 
these dividends were paid or are payable in common stock 
the company incurred no such dividends in either of the preceding years 
a portion of the shares of preferred stock on which dividends were incurred during remain outstanding  so additional dividends will be incurred in during  net loss applicable to common stockholders increased by dividends of  incurred on preferred stock outstanding during the year and imputed dividends of  as a result of convertibility of its outstanding preferred stock into common stock at below market prices 
these amounts are for earnings per share calculations and are not recorded in the company s financial statements 
and during  oil sales increased  or  to  when compared to  with sales from the eagle springs field increasing  or  to  during such period 
the revenues from the company s other interests increased  operating overhead revenue and well service revenue aggregately increased a net of  or  when compared to  consisting of an increase of  in operating overhead revenue in due to the increased number of eagle springs wells drilled and placed into production during and a decrease of  in well service income during as compared to as a result of reduced fees earned for water disposal services 
the increase of other income of  in as compared to was primarily a result of increases in value of new and used well equipment inventories used in the company s drilling program 
interest income increased  in to   of such increase attributable to interest earned on stock subscriptions receivable  while interest earned from excess cash investments decreased  in when compared to the company s oil and gas production expenses for decreased  or  to  when compared to  attributable principally to reduction in operating expenses of the eagle springs field of  in when compared to such expenses in these reductions were a result of increased efficiency and excess field operations capacity 
during  oil and gas exploration costs decreased  components of oil and gas exploration costs in were eagle springs d seismic program expenses of  and gravity and other surveys costing  for dixie flats   for the north humboldt prospect  and  for toano draw 
the company did not incur any similar expenses during dry hole  abandonment  and impairment costs aggregately decreased  when compared to such expenses during individually  dry hole expense decreased  when compared to dry hole costs for were primarily from the eldorado federal no 
of  the hot creek wash no 
of  and costs for the trout creek no 
well of  impairment and abandonment of leases decreased  or  when compared to major cost components during were abandonment of expired undeveloped leasehold costs of  impairment of undeveloped leases of  and impairment of well equipment inventory of  while the north willow creek nos 
and and the tomera ranch wells were impaired in at  general and administrative expenses decreased  in to  much of the reduction in general and administrative expenses was due to one time charges in that were not repeated in of  for relocation cost  and  as a reduction in securities offering costs that were required to be expensed because of delays in consummating the company s financing 
in the company incurred an increase of  in expenses related to financial public relations  information dissemination within the investment community and a decrease in certain salaries and benefits of  when compared to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased  or  when compared to such expenses attributable to the eagle springs field increased  primarily due to new wells being brought into production with high initial production rates  while such expenses attributable to the company s remaining properties increased  in when compared to interest expense increased  in to  primarily due to a full year of interest and amortization of loan fees associated with the company s  note payable  as opposed to nine months of interest and amortization of the same loan fees during accounting treatment of certain capitalized costs the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves  and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves  geological and geophysical costs  and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed 
included in oil and gas properties on the company s balance sheets are costs of wells in progress 
as of december   the company had net capitalized costs of approximately  related to a well in progress 
such costs are capitalized until a decision is made to plug and abandon or  if the well is still being evaluated  until one year after reaching total depth  at which time such costs are charged to expense  even though the well may subsequently be placed into production 
during the company was required to adopt a new accounting policy that requires it to assess the carrying cost of long lived assets whenever events or changes of circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when as assessment for impairment of oil and gas properties is performed  the company is required to compare the net carrying value of proved oil and gas properties on a lease by lease basis the lowest level at which cash flows can be determined on a consistent basis to the related estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows for such properties 
if the carrying value exceeds the net cash flows  then impairment is recognized to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
as a result of the adoption of this new accounting policy  at december   the company recognized an impairment charge of  during the first quarter of as a result of the foregoing policy  the company expects that from time to time capitalized costs will be charged to expense based on management s evaluation of specific wells or properties or the disposition  through sales or conveyances of fractional interests in connection with industry sharing arrangements  of property interests 
as part of the company s evaluation of its oil and gas reserves in connection with the preparation of the company s annual financial statements  the company completes an engineering evaluation of its properties based on current engineering information  oil and gas prices  and production costs  which may result in material changes in the total undiscounted net present value of the company s oil and gas reserves and may  therefore  result in an impairment allowance as discussed above 
see item properties 
certain costs the costs of exploring  drilling  producing  and transporting are higher in the geological province targeted by management than they would be in a more fully developed oil producing area 
access roads to drilling targets over relatively long distances frequently have to be completed  drilling equipment and services typically must be brought in from considerable distances  and there is no collection pipeline so that any oil that is produced must be trucked to a refinery  the nearest of which is in salt lake city  utah  a distance of several hundred miles 
liquidity and capital resources previous periods historically the company has obtained cash required for its operating and investing requirements from financing activities  principally the sale of equity securities 
during  operating activities used net cash of  when the company reported a net loss of  the loss included non cash expenses of  for abandonments and impairments including a  impairment resulting from the adoption of a new accounting policy   for depreciation  depletion  and amortization   for the issuance of stock options for services  and  for below market stock options 
components of working capital requiring cash expenditures included  used to reduce accounts payable and accrued expenses   for increases in accounts receivable  and  for payments of officers salaries payable 
the company s operations provided cash of  in when the company reported a net loss of  which included  in expenses due to abandonments and impairments  and  for depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was  operations used  of cash in  which included  in expenses due to abandonments and impairments   for the loss on the sale of the company s texas oil and gas properties  and  for depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
investing activities required cash of  in  including approximately  million for the purchase of barrett s working interest in the eagle springs field and approximately million for additions to oil and gas properties  principally the successful drilling in the ghost ranch field 
during investing activities used net cash of  principally due to  in additions to oil and gas properties 
in investing activities used net cash of  principally due to additions to oil and gas properties resulting from the acquisition of additional lease rights from kanowa in the eagle springs field and additional eagle springs drilling  including the completion of a water injection well 
as noted above  cash required for both operating and investing activities was provided from financing activities during each of the past three fiscal years 
financing activities provided cash of  during  including net cash of  from the issuance of equity securities and  in net proceeds from borrowings after  was repaid to retire previous indebtedness and  drawn from the company s newly established bank credit facility 
in  financing activities provided  from the issuance of equity securities 
in  financing activities provided  consisting primarily of a net of  from the issuance of equity securities and  in proceeds from new borrowings 
in november  the company established a  credit facility with a commercial bank  secured by the company s eagle springs and ghost ranch producing properties and related assets 
through march   the maximum loan amount permitted under the revolving credit arrangement is  subject to semi annual redetermination of the borrowing base  this amount is reduced on a quarterly basis by  through january    through january    through january   and  until maturity 
the credit agreement contains certain negative covenants  including those that limit or prohibit the company from paying dividends  selling assets  and incurring additional indebtedness  as well as certain affirmative financial covenants 
initially   was drawn under this bank credit facility to fund a portion of the purchase from barrett of its working interest in the eagle springs field in november in addition to the above  the company s oil and gas exploration and production activities were also advanced by approximately   and  provided during   and  respectively  by others under industry sharing arrangements related to specific drilling or other exploration 
current position future requirements the company believes that its working capital as of december   of  together with the cash expected to be provided from operations and from the  remaining available under the company s bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for  without relying on the receipt of additional revenues from development wells expected to be drilled during the year 
the company s net production revenue currently is sufficient to meet its cash requirements for oil and gas production costs  general and administrative expenses  ongoing shareholder investor relations  property maintenance expenditures  and payments of indebtedness 
of course  there can be no assurance that production quantities or oil prices will not decline significantly  which may contribute to operating cash shortages and require that funds budgeted for other discretionary purposes be used to supplement operations 
the company has formed an industry exploration group to conduct a d seismic study in pine valley  nevada  to define additional drilling targets and has budgeted  for this study during during the company intends to continue its development drilling program in the ghost ranch and eagle springs fields  as warranted 
the company currently estimates that there are approximately three locations in the ghost ranch field to be drilled to test horizons productive in existing wells at a net cost to the company for its share of drilling and completion costs of approximately  per well  for a total of approximately  for the year if all wells are drilled 
if the results of additional wells indicate that less than all three currently planned ghost ranch wells are warranted  the funds budgeted for the remaining wells will be available for other purposes 
after drilling the planned ghost ranch wells  the company intends to continue development drilling in the eagle springs field  selecting what appears to be the most promising of the several remaining development locations 
the company estimates that the cost of drilling and completing these wells will be approximately  each 
the company is budgeting approximately  for the above ghost ranch and eagle springs development drilling during the company is exploring the possible purchase of additional production to increase the company s financial security and stability as it continues its exploration 
as part of this effort  the company may seek to acquire the minority interest of barrett in the ghost ranch field 
the company anticipates that it would attempt to finance such a purchase through its existing bank credit facility 
the purchase of other producing properties may require additional debt and equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company can negotiate the acquisition of any properties or that the company will be able to obtain funds that may be required or that such funds can be obtained on terms favorable to the company 
the nature  extent  and cost of exploring prospects in the great basin province over several years cannot be predicted  but the total cost could amount to tens of millions of dollars 
because of the size of the total exploration possibilities and the company s limited resources  it is likely that the interest of the company s shareholders in the company and the interest of the company in its drilling prospects will continue to be diluted substantially as the company continues to obtain funding through the sale of additional securities or through sharing arrangements with industry participants 
there can be no assurance that exploration funds will be available to the company when required or  if available  that such funds can be obtained on terms acceptable or favorable to the company 
the company may also utilize funds available under its bank credit facility  cash now budgeted for exploration and development  as well as proceeds from the sale of additional equity securities or new borrowings to complete strategic corporate acquisitions 
no acquisition has been targeted  and there can be no assurance that any acquisition will be completed at all or on terms favorable to the company 
inflation the company s activities have not been  and in the near term are not expected to be  materially affected by inflation or changing prices in general 
the company s oil exploration and production activities are generally affected by prevailing sales prices for oil  however  and material price declines may make wells with low rates of production uneconomical to operate 
because of the size of potential discoveries in nevada  the company does not expect that short term declines in oil prices would materially affect its exploration activities
