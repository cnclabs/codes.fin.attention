all interest is payable at maturity or convertible into common stock upon conversion of the debentures 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million as a result of this placement

the fee paid to the placement agent consisted of an additional  units in lieu of cash compensation 
the net proceeds to the company were approximately million 
the aforementioned sales of stock and convertible debentures all represented significant dilution to existing stockholders 
however  because of the limited capital sources available to the company  management believes that it was in the best interests of the company and its stockholders to continue to raise money in this manner in order to continue operations 
the company s ability to generate additional cash from operations depends primarily upon signing research or licensing agreements  achieving defined benchmarks in such agreements  receiving regulatory approval for its products  and marketing hormones and enzyme products 
the company has one joint venture agreement in effect which contributed  to revenues 
however  there is no assurance that any additional revenues will be recognized or received under this agreement 
the company s cash requirements have increased by approximately million per year with the opening of its peptide manufacturing facility 
in addition  the company will face debt and interest obligations over the next several years 
however  because of the conversion prices of each of the issues of debentures  a substantial portion of such debentures has been  and a substantial portion of the remainder is expected to be  converted into common stock 
management believes that the company has sufficient financial resources to sustain its operations at the current level through at least the second quarter of the company will require additional funds through financing or licensing agreements to ensure continued operations beyond that time 
management is actively seeking licensing and or supply agreements with pharmaceutical companies 
the company is currently developing two calcitonin products an oral version and an injectable version for which it is seeking licensing partners 
the signing of one or more agreements will be necessary to fund operations and to repay its loans and interest thereon when due 
in the absence of or the delay in signing such agreements  obtaining adequate financing would be necessary 
however  there is no assurance that sufficient funds will be obtained 
the company believes that the implementation of a licensing transaction will satisfy the company s liquidity requirements over the short term 
satisfying the company s long term liquidity requirements will require the successful commercialization of one or more of its calcitonin products
