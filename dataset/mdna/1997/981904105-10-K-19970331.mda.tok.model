at december   worldcorp and mhs owned  shares  or  and  shares  or  respectively  of world airways outstanding common stock 
the remaining balance was publicly traded 
the managements of worldcorp and world airways are currently exploring ways to maximize value for the shareholders of each company 
worldcorp is currently evaluating the feasibility of a disposition of its interest in world airways through a secondary offering or a sale to a third party 
there can be no assurances  however  that any such transactions will ultimately be consummated 
on march   world airways announced that charles w 
pollard departed as president and chief executive officer

in august  us order and colonial data technologies corp 
colonial data entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which us order and colonial data would be merged with and into a new public company  intelidata technologies corporation intelidata 
pursuant to this merger  which was consummated on november   intelidata became the successor corporation to us order 
the merger was treated as a purchase of colonial data by us order 
intelidata concentrates on three markets consumer telecommunications  electronic commerce  and interactive services 
at december   worldcorp owned  shares of intelidata  or an ownership interest of approximately 
following this merger  the company reports its proportionate share of intelidata s financial results using the equity method of accounting 
during the third quarter of  the company announced its intention to purchase up to million shares of its publicly traded common stock pursuant to open market transactions

the private securities litigation reform act of the act was recently passed by congress 
the company desires to take advantage of the new safe harbor provisions in the act 
therefore  this report contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the impact of competitive products  product demand and market acceptance risks  reliance on key strategic alliances  fluctuations in operating results and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
these risks could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
overview worldcorp owns positions in companies that operate in two distinct business areas 
world airways nasdaq wlda provides worldwide passenger and cargo air transportation to major international airlines  the us air force  and international tour operators  with a fleet of md and dc aircraft 
intelidata nasdaq intd concentrates on three markets consumer telecommunications  electronic commerce  and interactive services 
the company is a highly leveraged holding company 
as a holding company  all of worldcorp s funds are generated through its positions in world airways and intelidata  neither of whom intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  world airways ability to pay dividends is currently restricted under a borrowing arrangement 
as of december   worldcorp has substantial parent company debt service obligations 
in order to meet these obligations and its general and administrative costs in  the company must use its existing cash and either sell shares of world airways or intelidata  or issue additional debt or equity 
under the terms of certain borrowing arrangements  worldcorp has pledged all of its shares of world airways and intelidata as collateral for the borrowings 
world airways world airways is a leading global provider of long range passenger and cargo air transportation outsourcing services to major international airlines under fixed rate  multi year contracts 
world airways passenger and freight operations employ wide body aircraft which are currently operated under contracts  primarily with pacific rim airlines 
these contracts generally require world airways to supply aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance acmi or wet lease  while it s customers are responsible for a large portion of the other operating expenses  including fuel 
world airways airline customers have determined that outsourcing a portion of their wide body passenger and cargo requirements can be less expensive  and offer greater operational and financial flexibility  than purchasing new aircraft and additional spare parts required for such aircraft 
world airways also leads a contractor teaming arrangement that is the largest single supplier of commercial airlift services to the united states air force s air mobility command us air force or usaf 
in july  world airways restructured its business to focus on the growing and profitable acmi contract services 
as such  world airways ceased all scheduled passenger and scheduled charter services as of october   taking a one time charge of million 
world airways generally charges customers on a block hour basis rather than a per seat or per pound basis 
block hours are defined as the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power at the point of origin to the time it comes to rest at its final destination 
world airways provides most services under two types of contracts wet lease contracts and full service contracts 
under wet lease contracts  world airways provides the aircraft  cockpit crew  maintenance and insurance and the customer provides all other operating services and bears all other operating expenses  including fuel and fuel servicing  marketing costs associated with obtaining passengers and or cargo  airport passenger and cargo handling fees  landing fees  cabin crews  catering  ground handling and aircraft push back and de icing services 
under full service contracts  world airways provides fuel  catering  ground handling  cabin crew and all related support services as well 
accordingly  world airways generally charges a lower rate per block hour for wet lease contracts than full service contracts  although it does not necessarily earn a lower profit 
because of shifts in the mix between full service contracts and wet lease contracts  fluctuations in revenues are not necessarily indicative of volume trends or profitability 
it is important  therefore  to measure world airways business volume by block hours flown and to measure profitability by operating income per block hour 
as is common in the air transportation industry  world airways has relatively high fixed aircraft costs 
while it believes that the lease rates on its md aircraft are favorable relative to lease rates of other md operators  world airways md aircraft have higher lease costs although lower operating costs than its dc aircraft 
therefore  achieving high average daily utilization of its aircraft particularly its md aircraft at attractive yields are important factors to it financial results 
in addition to fixed aircraft costs  a portion of its labor costs are fixed due to monthly minimum guarantees to cockpit crewmembers and flight attendants 
customers historically  world airways business has relied heavily on its contracts with malaysian airline system berhad malaysian airlines  pt garuda indonesia garuda and the us air force 
these customers provided approximately   and  respectively  of world airways revenues and   and  respectively  of total block hours from continuing operations during for  these customers provided approximately   and  respectively  of its revenues and   and  respectively  of total block hours from continuing operations 
in  world airways commenced operations for philippine airlines  inc philippine airlines providing four md aircraft under year round wet lease contracts 
these operations provided approximately and of world airways revenues and block hours from continuing operations  respectively  during world airways expects that the agreement with philippine airlines will continue to have a substantial impact on its revenues and block hours in malaysian airlines 
world airways has provided wet lease services to malaysian airlines since  providing wet lease services for malaysian airlines scheduled passenger and cargo operations as well as transporting passengers for the annual hadj pilgrimage 
mhs  which owns of world airways as of december   also owns of malaysian airlines 
in late  world airways entered into a series of multi year contracts  with expiration dates ranging from to  to provide aircraft to malaysian airlines 
in  world airways provided three aircraft for hadj operations 
world airways recently entered into a new month agreement for year round operations including the hadj with malaysian airlines whereby it will provide two aircraft with cockpit crews  maintenance and insurance to malaysian airlines newly formed charter division through may world airways is currently in preliminary discussions with malaysian airlines regarding a potential eleven month reduction in the utilization of one of these aircraft during the month term of the contract 
until recently  world airways operated four passenger aircraft for malaysian airlines under the multi year agreements described above 
the contract for two of the four passenger aircraft for malaysian airlines expired in march while world airways is deploying these two aircraft in the hadj  and will actively re market the aircraft thereafter  world airways can provide no assurance that it will be able to redeploy the two aircraft  beginning june  at price and utilization levels at least as favorable as under the terms of the malaysian airlines contracts 
world airways originally operated three md cargo aircraft for malaysian airlines 
however  beginning in july   and as mutually agreed by the parties  world airways redeployed two cargo aircraft  which had been operating under these contracts  into the philippine airlines contract 
world airways and malaysian airlines are currently discussing the future redeployment of these aircraft back into malaysian airlines operations in order to meet the contracts original obligations 
world airways can provide no assurances  however  that it will  in fact  be able to redeploy these two aircraft back into malaysian airlines operation to meet the contracts original obligations 
revenues associated with these contractual obligations are included in world airways backlog amount included herein 
garuda 
world airways has flown for garuda periodically since and yearly since since  world airways has been one of the largest providers of passenger services to indonesia for the hadj pilgrimage 
the indonesian hadj pilgrimage is the world s largest due to the size of indonesia s islamic population 
in  approximately  indonesians traveled to jeddah for the hadj pilgrimage 
during the hadj pilgrimage  world airways provided passenger service to garuda with seven aircraft  flying approximately  indonesians on company aircraft 
due to world airways capacity constraints during the period of hadj flying  world airways reached an agreement with garuda to operate six aircraft during the pilgrimage 
philippine airlines 
in may  world airways entered into a new acmi contract with philippine airlines  thereby further expanding its presence in the pacific rim 
world airways presently operates four md passenger aircraft for philippine airlines under an agreement  with high minimum monthly utilization levels 
world airways  however  has recently received a written communication from philippine airlines in which the airline contends that its leases for all four aircraft expire on november  world airways believes that this position is contrary to the understanding of the parties that each of the md s are to be leased by philippine airlines for a period of months from delivery of each aircraft 
the parties are currently discussing the length of the lease term for these aircraft 
world airways can provide no assurances  however  that philippine airlines will agree to lease any of the four md passenger aircraft beyond november   or that world airways will be able to secure other business at as favorable price and utilization levels 
also  subsequent to year end  at philippine airlines request  world airways agreed to a payment plan with respect to philippine airlines wet lease obligations for several months beginning in march although philippine airlines is current on this payment plan to date  if philippine airlines defaults on this payment plan  or fails to meet its monthly aircraft lease obligations  this development  if not offset by other business  would have a material adverse effect on the cash flows  financial condition and results of operation of world airways 
us air force 
world airways has provided international air transportation to the us air force since the overall downsizing of the us military  combined with a need to respond quickly to the growing number of global regional conflicts places a premium on the mobility of the us armed forces 
this is reflected in the stable size over the past several years of the usaf s procurement of commercial airlift services 
although world airways agreements with the usaf provide for full service contracts with certain minimum performance requirements  world airways has risks similar to an acmi agreement because the usaf agreements are cost plus contracts at attractive rates 
the usaf awards points to air carriers acting alone or through teaming arrangements in proportion to the number and type of aircraft such carriers make available to craf 
world airways utilizes such teaming arrangements to maximize the value of potential awards 
world airways leads a contractor teaming arrangement that enjoys a market share of the usaf s overall commercial airlift requirement 
during a period in which the us military downsized substantially  world airways portion of the fixed usaf award increased from million for the government s fiscal year  to million for the government s fiscal year 
the current annual contract commenced on october  and expires on september  these contracts provide for a fixed level of scheduled business from the us air force with opportunities for additional short term expansion business on and ad hoc basis as needs arise 
due to the utilization of a significant number of world airways aircraft under multi year contracts and other contractual commitments  it is unlikely that it will be able to accept all of the available expansion business 
although overall defense department spending is being reduced  the level of the us air forces contract awards has remained relatively constant in recent years 
world airways  however  cannot determine how future cuts in military spending may affect future operations with the us air force 
although world airways s customers bear the financial risk of filling the world airways aircraft with passengers or cargo  world airways can be affected adversely if its customers are unable to operate its aircraft profitably  or if one or more of world airways customers experience a material adverse change in their market demand  financial condition or results of operations 
under these circumstances  world airways can be adversely affected by receiving delayed or partial payments or by receiving customer demands for rate and utilization reductions  flight cancellations  and or early termination of their agreements 
as a result of these and other contracts  world airways had an overall contract backlog at december  of million  compared to million at december  approximately million of the backlog relates to operations 
world airways backlog for each contract is determined by multiplying the minimum number of block hours defined as the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power at the point of origin to the time it comes to rest at its destination guaranteed under the applicable contract by the specified hourly rate under such contract 
approximately and of the backlog relates to its contracts with malaysian airlines and philippine airlines  respectively 
while the percentage of its block hour capacity that is currently under contract exceeds the comparable percentage in the past several years  world airways still has substantial uncontracted capacity in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  a significant portion of world airways current contracts expire near the end of although there can be no assurance that it will be able to secure additional business to reduce this excess capacity  world airways is actively seeking customers for and beyond 
world airways financial results and financial condition would be affected adversely if it is unable to secure additional business to reduce this excess capacity 
the information regarding major customers and foreign revenue is contained in note segments and major customers of the company s notes to financial statements in item competition the market for outsourcing air passenger and cargo acmi services is highly competitive 
certain of the passenger and cargo air carriers against which world airways competes possess substantially greater financial resources and more extensive facilities and equipment than those which are now  or will in the foreseeable future become  available to world airways 
world airways believes that the most important bases for competition in the acmi outsourcing business are the age of the aircraft fleet  the passenger  payload and cubic capacities of the aircraft  and the price  flexibility  quality and reliability of the air transportation service provided 
competitors in the acmi outsourcing market include martinair holland  tower air and american transair and all cargo carriers  such as atlas air  gemini air cargo  polar air cargo and kitty hawk  and scheduled and non scheduled passenger carriers which have substantial belly capacity 
the ability of world airways to achieve the growth anticipated by its strategic plan depends upon its success in convincing major international airlines that outsourcing some portion of their air passenger and cargo business remains more cost effective than undertaking passenger or cargo operations with their own incremental capacity and resources 
the allocation of military air transportation contracts by the usaf is based upon the number and type of aircraft a carrier  alone or through a teaming arrangement  makes available for use in times of national emergencies 
the formation of competing teaming arrangements comprised of larger partners than those sponsored by world airways  an increase by other air carriers in their commitment of aircraft to the emergency program  or the withdrawal of it current partners  could adversely affect the size of the usaf contracts  if any  which are awarded to world airways in future years 
cyclical nature of air carrier business world airways operates in a challenging business environment 
the air transportation industry is highly sensitive to general economic conditions 
since a substantial portion of passenger airline travel both business and personal is discretionary  the industry tends to experience severe adverse financial results during general economic downturns and can be adversely affected by unexpected global political developments 
the financial results of air cargo carriers are also adversely affected by general economic downturns due to the reduced demand for air cargo transportation 
in and  the combination of a generally weak global economy and the depressed state of the air transportation industry adversely affected its operating performance 
although world airways recently has experienced a growth in demand  such that block hours flown from continuing operations increased in by over  there can be no assurance that this level of growth will continue 
seasonality historically  world airways business has been significantly affected by seasonal factors 
during the first quarter  world airways typically experiences lower levels of utilization and yields due to lower demand for passenger and cargo services relative to other times of the year 
world airways experiences higher levels of utilization and yields in the second quarter  principally due to peak demand for commercial passenger services associated with the annual hadj pilgrimage 
in  world airways flight operations associated with the hadj pilgrimage will occur from march to may because the islamic calendar is a lunar based calendar  the hadj pilgrimage occurs approximately to days earlier each year relative to the western gregorian calendar 
as a result  revenues resulting from future hadj pilgrimage contracts will continue to shift from the second quarter to the first quarter over the next several years 
world airways believes that its contracts with malaysian airlines and the usaf should lessen the effect of these seasonal factors 
geographic concentration world airways derives a significant percentage of its revenues and block hours from its operations in the pacific rim region 
while it believes the pacific rim region is a growth market for air transportation  any economic decline or any military or political disturbance in this area may interfere with world airways ability to provide service in this area and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
utilization of aircraft due to the large capital costs of leasing and maintaining its aircraft  each of world airways aircraft must have high utilization at attractive rates in order for it to operate profitably 
although world airways strategy is to enter into long term contracts with its customers  the terms of its existing customer contracts are substantially shorter than the terms of world airways lease obligations with respect to the aircraft 
there can be no assurance that world airways will be able to enter into additional contracts with new or existing customers or that it will be able to obtain enough additional business to fully utilize each aircraft 
world airways financial results could be materially adversely affected even by relatively brief periods of low aircraft utilization and yields 
in order to maximize aircraft utilization  world airways does not intend to acquire new aircraft unless such aircraft would be necessary to service existing needs or it has obtained additional acmi contracts for the aircraft to service 
world airways is seeking to obtain additional acmi contracts with new and existing customers  to which such new aircraft would be dedicated when placed in service  but it can provide no assurance that it will obtain new acmi contracts or that existing acmi contracts will be renewed or extended 
maintenance engine maintenance accounts for most of world airways annual maintenance expenses 
typically  the hourly cost of engine maintenance increases as the aircraft ages 
world airways outsources major airframe maintenance and power plant work to several suppliers 
world airways has a year contract expiring in august with united technologies corporation s pratt whitney group for all off wing maintenance on the pw engines that power its md aircraft 
under this contract  the manufacturer agreed to provide such maintenance services at a cost not to exceed specified rates per hour during the term of the contract 
its maintenance costs associated with the md aircraft and pw engines have been significantly reduced due in part to manufacturer guarantees and warranties which began to expire in and which will fully expire by in addition  the specified rates per hour are subject to annual escalation  increasing substantially in accordingly  while world airways believes the terms of this agreement have resulted in lower engine maintenance costs than it otherwise would incur  engine maintenance costs will increase substantially during the last five years of the agreement 
world airways will begin to accrue these increased expenses in therefore  world airways expects that maintenance expenses will continue to increase during the remainder of the term of the contract as its aircraft fleet ages 
operating losses while world airways generated operating income each year from through and in  it sustained operating losses in and of million and million  respectively  and net losses of million in each of these two years 
for the year ended december   world airways incurred a net loss of million  which resulted from operating losses incurred in its scheduled service operations  which were discontinued in  and the related estimated loss on disposal 
earnings from continuing operations were million for there can be no assurance that world airways will be able to generate operating income in or future years 
intelidata intelidata was incorporated in order to effect the mergers of us order and colonial data 
the merger was announced on august   when us order and colonial data entered into an agreement and plan of merger merger agreement 
on november   the merger was consummated with each share of outstanding us order and colonial data common stock being exchanged for one share of intelidata common stock 
the merger was treated as a purchase of colonial data by us order 
at december   worldcorp s ownership in intelidata was approximately 
following this merger  worldcorp reports its proportionate share of intelidata s financial results using the equity method of accounting 
on october   us order acquired the business of braun  simmons co  braun simmons  for approximately million consisting of cash and us order common stock and including us order transaction costs 
braun simmons was an information engineering firm specializing in the development of home banking and electronic commerce solutions for financial institutions 
the acquisition expands intelidata s product line for both large and small financial institutions 
the business of intelidata consists of the businesses previously conducted by us order  colonial data and colonial data s subsidiaries 
intelidata develops and markets products and services for the telecommunications and financial services industries through its three business divisions consumer telecommunications  electronic commerce and interactive services 
the consumer telecommunications division designs  develops and markets telecommunications products that support intelligent network services being developed and implemented by the regional bell operating companies rbocs and other telephone companies telcos 
intelidata has concentrated its product development and marketing efforts on products that support caller id and other emerging intelligent network services  including a smart telephone  the telesmart intelifonetm  which provide consumers call management features and the ability to access numerous network services and interactive applications via telephone 
intelidata currently offers a line of caller id adjunct units and telephones with integrated caller id  small business telecommunications systems and high end consumer telecommunications equipment 
intelidata also repairs and refurbishes telecommunications products for commercial customers and provides other services that support the development and implementation of intelligent network services 
the electronic commerce division develops and markets products and services to assist financial institutions in their home banking and electronic bill payment initiatives 
the products are designed to assist consumers in accessing and transacting business with their banks and credit unions electronically  and to assist financial institutions in connecting to and transacting business with third parties  including data processors and billers 
the services focus on a financial institution s back office  offering outsourcing for data entry  telemarketing  customer service and technical support 
intelidata currently receives its electronic commerce revenues largely from the sale of products and services to visa international service association  inc visa member banks 
the interactive services division was established to provide interactive applications for use on smart telephones and other small screen devices  such as alpha numeric pagers  personal communication systems pcs telephones and personal digital assistants pdas 
intelidata intends to sell interactive applications directly to end users and through other companies  including telcos and wireless communications companies 
intelidata s current interactive applications include electronic national directory assistance lookup  one way alpha numeric paging  one way internet e mail  a personal directory data save and restore function and information services such as news  weather  sports scores  stock quotes  lottery results and horoscopes 
uncertainty as to future financial results intelidata believes that the merger will offer opportunities for long term efficiencies that should positively affect future operating results of the combined companies 
however  the combined companies will be more complex and diverse than either us order or colonial data individually  and the combination and continued operation of their distinct business operations will present difficult challenges for its management due to the increased time and resources required in the management effort 
while the management and the board of intelidata believe that the combination can be effected in a manner that will realize the value of the two companies  neither management group has experience in combinations of this size or complexity 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the process of effecting the business combination can be effectively managed to realize the operational efficiencies anticipated to result from the merger 
following the merger  in order to maintain and increase profitability  the combined company will need to successfully integrate and streamline overlapping functions 
the two predecessor companies had different systems and procedures in many operational areas that must be rationalized and integrated 
there can be no assurances that integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
the integration of certain operations following the merger will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of the combined companies 
failure to effectively accomplish the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on intelidata s results of operation and financial condition 
developing marketplace home banking and smart telephones are developing markets 
consumer preferences in interactive technologies are difficult to predict 
intelidata s future growth and profitability will depend  in part  upon consumer acceptance of electronic home banking and smart telephone technologies and a significant expansion in the consumer market for telephone based interactive applications technologies 
even if these markets experience substantial growth  there can be no assurance that intelidata s products and services will be commercially successful or benefit from such growth 
much of intelidata s success in the smart telephone market depends on intelidata s ability to meet design specifications and delivery requirements for its products and services 
there can be no assurance of the timing of introduction of  necessary regulatory approvals for  or market acceptance of these services and applications 
intelidata faces competition in these markets from other emerging interactive applications delivered through personal computers  cable television and integrated service digital network isdn 
fluctuations in operating results historically  us order and colonial data have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results  and accordingly  intelidata may experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond intelidata s control 
these include the size and timing of customer orders or the royalty payments from visa interactive  if any  changes in intelidata s pricing policies or those of its competitors  new product introductions or enhancements by competitors  delays in the introduction of new products or product enhancements by intelidata or by its competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products  market acceptance of new products  the timing and nature of sales  marketing  and research and development expenses by intelidata and its competitors  the timing of programs offering caller id or other intelligent network services by a telco  disruptions in sources of supply  the effects of regulation on caller id and other intelligent network services  the timing and extent of promotional activities by a telco  changes in service charges by a telco  other changes in operating expenses  personnel changes and general economic conditions 
additionally  certain regional bell operating companies have entered into merger agreements 
intelidata is unable to assess the future effect on the company of these mergers  if consummated  and of other possible consolidations in the telecommunications industry 
no assurance can be given that such quarterly variations will not occur in the future and  accordingly  the results of any one quarter may not be indicative of the operating results for future quarters 
reliance on caller id revenues a substantial majority of intelidata s revenues are derived from sales and leases of its caller id products 
the sale or lease of these products is directly linked to the implementation and promotion of caller id service by telcos 
the timing of such implementation may be affected by government regulation  by changes in the telecommunications industry resulting from changes in the regulatory and competitive environment  by switch and software upgrades and by other factors 
there can be no assurance that telcos will continue to introduce and promote this service successfully or that it will gain widespread market acceptance 
delays in the introduction of caller id service in local markets or failure of this service to gain widespread market acceptance would materially and adversely affect intelidata s business  operating results and financial condition 
concentration of distribution of products and services intelidata sells its telecommunications products and services to telcos  individual telephone subscribers  other equipment manufacturers on a private label basis private label customers and retail chains 
in addition  intelidata leases its products to individual telco subscribers 
sales and leases to individual telco subscribers are largely dependent on direct fulfillment distribution arrangements with certain rbocs and other telcos 
since intelidata views the telcos with which it maintains direct fulfillment relationships as its customers  it considers its customer base to be highly concentrated 
intelidata s current telco fulfillment arrangements are not exclusive and may be terminated by either party 
the loss of any one or more of intelidata s major customers or the termination of its distribution arrangements with any telco or the failure to be selected for significant orders or programs by a telco could materially and adversely affect intelidata s business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  consolidation in the telecommunications industry or changes in the telecommunications regulatory environment could result in the loss of such customers or business 
technological considerations intelidata s business activities are concentrated in fields characterized by rapid and significant technological advances 
there can be no assurance that intelidata will remain competitive technologically or that its products  processes or services will continue to be reflective of such advances 
failure to introduce new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance on a timely basis could materially and adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that intelidata will not encounter unanticipated technical  marketing or other problems or delays relating to new products  features or services which it has recently introduced or which it may introduce in the future 
moreover  there can be no assurance that its new products  features or services will be successful  that the introduction of new products  features or services by its competitors will not materially and adversely affect the sales of intelidata s existing products or that it will be able to adapt to future changes in the telecommunications industry 
most of intelidata s competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technological and research and development resources than intelidata 
dependence on foreign production intelidata s caller id units and certain other products  including the smart telephone  the telesmart intelifonetm  are manufactured by companies with facilities in hong kong  malaysia  and the people s republic of china 
these facilities are supplemented  in part  by other manufacturers in asia for certain integrated telephone and small business system products and by limited manufacturing facilities in connecticut 
the availability or cost of these caller id units and smart telephones may be adversely affected by political  economic or labor conditions in hong kong  malaysia or the people s republic of china  including the return of hong kong to china  and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  a change in the tariff structure or other trade policies of the united states or countries from which intelidata will import products could adversely affect intelidata s foreign manufacturing strategies 
restrictions from the visa agreement as a condition of visa s acquisition of intelidata s bill payment operations and technology the visa bill pay system  intelidata has agreed to work exclusively with visa in certain areas and to refrain from certain activities that are in competition with visa and its affiliates 
these covenants may increase its reliance upon visa 
intelidata s dependence on visa  and the terms of the agreement between the parties  may have a material adverse effect on intelidata 
importance of strategic alliances one of intelidata s business strategies is to manufacture or sell its products and services through strategic alliances 
the success of this strategy will depend to an extent both on the ultimate success of its strategic partners as well as on the ability of its partners to successfully market intelidata s products and services 
there can be no assurance that any alliance partners will view their alliance with intelidata as significant for their own businesses or that they will not reassess their commitment to intelidata at any time in the future 
competition consumer telecommunications 
the market for intelidata s products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
at present  intelidata s principal competitors are cidco  lucent and northern telecom 
intelidata s caller id products also compete with caller id telephones offered by panasonic  sony  thomson and us electronics 
marketing of intelidata s smart telephone is subject to competition from smart telephones marketed or developed by philips  northern telecom and cidco as well as other emerging platforms for interactive applications delivered through personal computers and cable television 
intelidata expects competition in the markets for its consumer telecommunications products and services to increase in the future and expects competition from existing and new competitors  possibly including rbocs  other telcos or other current customers  as well as from network switch based services and from the increased application of cellular technology 
intelidata s primary current and potential competitors in the market for its consumer telecommunications products and services have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than itself 
competition could materially and adversely affect intelidata s results of operations through price reductions and loss of market share 
intelidata competes with a large number of competitors for its repair services and other services supporting the development and implementation of intelligent network services 
several of its competitors in the market for such services have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than intelidata 
there can be no assurance that intelidata will be able to continue to compete successfully against its existing competitors or that it will be able to compete successfully against new competitors 
electronic commerce 
the market for interactive products and services is highly competitive and subject to rapid innovation and technological change  shifting consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions 
intelidata s home banking products and services compete with services offered by a number of competitors and competition may intensify as a result of new market entrants 
banks have developed home banking products for their own customers and  in the future  may offer these services to other banks 
non banks also may develop home banking products to offer to banks 
computer software and data processing companies also offer home banking services 
visa competes with other organizations  including mastercard international  inc mastercard  which offers its masterbanking home banking service through checkfree corporation 
many competitors exist for its various banking products including other manufacturers of touch tone response systems  other financial software companies and financial services software and service companies 
intelidata believes that its primary competition for its customer support services will come from financial institutions and third parties that choose to offer customer support services either directly through visa s customer support messaging standard csms product or on their own 
intelidata expects that competition in all of these areas will increase in the near future 
interactive services 
the industry for interactive services is emerging and there is potential for a number of companies to enter the marketplace 
currently  intelidata s primary competitor is smartserve online  inc relationship with visa us order sold the visa bill pay system to visa on august   for approximately million in cash  the assumption of certain liabilities and rights to a month royalty period commencing january  and ending december  the royalty period 
visa subsequently transferred these assets to visa interactive  its wholly owned subsidiary 
the royalty obligation is based on the number of customers who use the visa bill pay system during the royalty period 
the agreement with visa expressly provides that the royalty will apply only if the means by which a customer makes an electronic bill payment involves the use of a significant portion of the visa bill pay system 
royalties to intelidata are calculated and paid by visa interactive quarterly during the royalty period 
because the amount of the royalties to intelidata is dependent upon the number of customers that use the visa bill pay system on a monthly basis during the royalty period  intelidata cannot provide any assurances of the amount of royalties  if any  that will be payable by visa interactive to intelidata 
the royalty payment will be reduced for each quarter through december   by an offset amount the visa offset which was initially set at  if the royalty payment that would otherwise be due in respect of a quarter is smaller than the offset amount for that quarter  no royalty payment will be made to intelidata  and the difference between  and the royalty otherwise due will increase the size of the visa offset for the next quarter 
the aggregate amount of the visa offset for the royalty period is  intelidata did not receive any royalty revenue from visa in due to the visa offset and does not expect to receive any royalty revenue after application of the visa offset through at least the end of the second quarter of in addition  under the terms of its agreement with visa  visa interactive is not obligated to pay royalties to intelidata for active bank customers who utilize home banking and bill payment technology independently developed by visa interactive 
if visa interactive independently develops or acquires its own home banking and bill payment technology which does not use or build upon its technology  this could have a material adverse effect on the amount of royalties payable by visa interactive to intelidata 
as a condition of visa s acquisition of the visa bill pay system  intelidata has agreed to work exclusively with visa in certain areas and to refrain from certain activities that are in competition with visa and its affiliates 
these covenants may increase intelidata s reliance upon visa 
dependence on key employees intelidata is highly dependent on certain key executive officers and technical employees to manage the operations and business of intelidata as well as to implement the business plans of intelidata on an ongoing basis 
the loss of any such key employees could have an adverse impact on the future operations of intelidata 
regulation the telecommunications act of and regulations or orders promulgated thereunder may result in or accelerate changes in various aspects of the telecommunications industry  including the competitive environment  the delivery and pricing of various telecommunications products and services and possible consolidation 
although intelidata is unable to predict what effect  if any  the telecommunications act of or other regulatory developments may have upon the telecommunications industry or intelidata s business  any such effects could have a material adverse impact on the future operations of intelidata 
in the united states  caller id and other intelligent network services are subject to federal and state regulation 
caller id and other intelligent network services may in the future be subject to further regulation by the federal government  state public utility commissions and other regulatory authorities  as well as court challenges  including possible challenges due to protests from special interest groups that object to such services on the basis of privacy concerns 
an order issued by the fcc effective december   requires all united states telephone service providers with signaling system switching architecture to transmit to each other without charge caller id number information on interstate calls within the united states except for public pay phones and party lines 
the fcc s order also requires that telcos that offer caller id service must provide to their telephone subscribers without charge a per call blocking mechanism to block the transmission of their caller id information on interstate calls and must inform subscribers that their telephone numbers may be identified to a called party and how to use this blocking capability 
volatility of stock price the market price of intelidata s stock has experienced significant volatility 
the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology and developmental stage companies and that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
factors such as announcements of the introduction of new products or services by intelidata or its competitors  announcements of joint development efforts or corporate partnerships in the interactive applications industry  market conditions in the banking  telecommunications and other emerging growth company sectors and rumors relating to it or its competitors may have a significant impact on the market price of intelidata s stock 
limited proprietary protection intelidata possesses limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to its technology 
intelidata depends in part upon its proprietary technology and know how to differentiate its products from those of its competitors and works independently and from time to time with third parties with respect to the design and engineering of its own products 
intelidata also relies on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance  however  that intelidata will be able to protect its technology or successfully develop new technology or gain access to such technology or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently or that competitors will not obtain unauthorized access to its proprietary technology  that third parties will not misuse the technology to which intelidata has granted access  or that intelidata s contractual or legal remedies will be sufficient to protect intelidata s interests in its proprietary technology 
certain of lucent s caller id patents are licensed by lucent to intelidata and others  including its competitors 
if the lucent license were terminated and intelidata were unable to negotiate a new patent license agreement with lucent  intelidata would no longer be authorized to manufacture or sell caller id products in the united states other than to the rbocs and to lucent  and intelidata s business would be materially and adversely affected 
limited sources of supply the key components used in intelidata s products are currently being purchased from multiple sources  except for its application specific integrated circuit asic chips  which are purchased from a single source 
although it believes it could develop other sources for each of the components for its products  the process could take several months  and the inability or refusal of any such source to continue to supply components could have a material adverse effect on intelidata pending the development of an alternative source

the amount of any increase will depend on the products and services offered by intelidata and its alliances and strategic partners 
in particular  intelidata expects that these expenses will increase as it upgrades its systems and operations in anticipation of the potential for increased business in intelidata also expects its advertising and promotion expenses will increase substantially in due to the further marketing efforts within the consumer telecommunications and interactive services division 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue 
us order s operating revenues increased by million from million in to million in the increase was primarily related to the sale of us order s products  such as its smart telephones  which it began selling through its preferred provider relationship with visa in operating expenses 
us order s operating expenses decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease was primarily from a one time payment to certain employees in august of million made in conjunction with the august  sale of us order s bill pay operations where visa required that all us order employees who became employees of visa interactive cancel their vested options to eliminate any potential conflict of interest 
the decrease was also due to reduced advertising and promotion expenses in worldcorp general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  to million from million in the comparable period 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in legal and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  to million from million during the comparable period

on november   us order and colonial data were merged with and into intelidata 
as described above  following the merger  worldcorp reports its share of intelidata s financial results under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of the merger  intelidata reported one time  noncash merger related charges of approximately million  of which worldcorp recorded its share  or million 
these charges related to the write off of in process research and development expenses for purchased in house technology that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the merger with colonial data and did not have alternative future uses

as a holding company  all of worldcorp s funds are generated through its positions in world airways and intelidata which have not paid dividends on common stock since at december   world airways has a working capital deficit of million and has substantial debt and lease commitments 
at december   intelidata has working capital of million  with no long term debt 
world airways ability to pay dividends is currently restricted under a borrowing arrangement 
additionally  the provisions of the indenture governing worldcorp s debentures causes world airways not to pay dividends upon the occurence of any events of default by worldcorp under such indenture 
world airways and intelidata currently intend to retain their future earnings  if any  to fund the growth and development of their business and  therefore  do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
of the million in cash and cash equivalents at december   approximately million is held by world airways and  therefore  is not available to satisfy worldcorp s obligations 
as of december   worldcorp had parent company repayment obligations  including principal and interest  of approximately million for in order to meet these obligations and its general and administrative costs  the company must use its existing cash and either sell shares of world airways or intelidata  or issue additional debt or equity 
under the terms of certain borrowing arrangements however  worldcorp has pledged all of its shares of world airways and intelidata as collateral for the borrowings 
the company is currently evaluating the feasibility of a disposition of its interest in world airways through a secondary offering or a sale to a third party 
any such transaction would require the approval of certain other parties see notes  and 
additionally  management believes it will be successful in reducing the amount of collateral securing its borrowings  either by renegotiating the terms of the loan or by entering into a new loan with another financial institution 
although there can be no assurance that worldcorp will be successful in consummating these transactions  management believes that its existing cash and the anticipated proceeds from a combination of sales of stock of world airways or intelidata  renegotiations of its existing borrowing arrangements  or new financing arrangements  will be sufficient to allow the company to meet its operating requirements and repayment obligations for at december   based on quoted market prices  the market value of the company s  shares of world airways and  shares of intelidata  approximated million and million  respectively  although these values have declined since year end 
world airways is also highly leveraged 
world airways incurred substantial debt and lease commitments during the past three years in connection with its acquisition of md aircraft and related spare parts 
at december   world airways had total long term indebtedness of approximately million and notes payable and current maturities of long term obligations of million 
in addition  world airways has significant future long term obligations under aircraft lease obligations relating to its aircraft 
world airways has historically financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements out of cash flow from operating activities  public and private sales of its common stock  secured borrowings  and other financings from banks and other lenders 
the degree to which world airways is leveraged could have important consequences to holders of common stock  including the following i its ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  ii its degree of leverage and related debt service obligations  as well as its obligations under operating leases for aircraft  may make it more vulnerable than some of its competitors in a prolonged economic downturn  and iii its financial position may restrict its ability to pursue new business opportunities and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business conditions 
world airways cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
as is common in the airline industry  world airways operates with a working capital deficit 
at december  world airways current assets were million and current liabilities were million 
world airways believes that the combination of the financings consummated to date  income from continuing operations and certain additional financings will be sufficient to allow it to meet its cash requirements related to the remaining phase out of its discontinued operations and the operating and capital requirements for its continuing operations for the next twelve months 
at december   intelidata had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
intelidata has generated operating losses since its inception 
intelidata s smart telephone and home banking products and services are subject to the risks inherent in the marketing and development of new products 
the market for these products and services is relatively new and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards  changes in end user requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
however  the acquisition of colonial data has provided intelidata with established product lines and sales channels in large telecommunications markets 
the industry for intelidata s products and services is intensely competitive 
intelidata experiences direct competition from manufacturers of smart telephones  caller id units  and cordless phones and from companies that develop transaction processing software for interactive applications and customer support services 
the acquisition of colonial data has provided intelidata with a revenue stream that totaled approximately million and million  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and the nine months ended september  there can be no assurance as to what level of future sales or royalties  if any  that intelidata will receive from visa  visa member banks and retail markets for its smart telephone and home banking products and services 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to providing million of cash in the comparable period in this decrease in cash in resulted primarily from an increase in losses  and increase in accounts receivable  and a decrease in unearned revenue  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable during cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to using million in the comparable period in this decrease in cash used resulted primarily from the purchase of rotable spare parts required for the integration of two md aircraft and incremental dc aircraft in  as compared to the acquisition of engines and spare parts which were financed in in addition  the company s consolidated cash was reduced as a result of the merger and the company s change to the equity method of accounting for its investment in intelidata
