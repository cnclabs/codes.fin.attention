general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  the description of the company s business operations  and the financial statements and related notes and schedules included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see item business  forward looking statements 
the company reports its results of operations using a fiscal year which ends on the last sunday in december 
most fiscal years have weeks but some consist of weeks 
fiscal was a week year  while fiscal    and were week years 
this variation in time periods most affects revenues and related costs of sales and salary costs as other expenses such as rent and utilities are usually recorded on a monthly basis 
however  differences in the number of weeks in a fiscal year should be considered in reviewing financial data 
compared with the company s total revenues increased  in over this increase was the result of a  increase in motor fuel sales offset by a  decline in merchandise sales 
miscellaneous revenues were essentially flat between the two years 
the increased fuel revenues resulted from increased prices and an increase of  gallons of fuel sold at retail offset by a  gallon decline in wholesale gallons sold 
the increase in retail fuel gallons sold parallels the increase in the average number of locations selling fuel in as compared to the decrease in wholesale fuel gallons resulted from the absence of large spot sales to certain customers in the majority of the company s wholesale sales are to smaller independent retailers  many of which are contractually committed to purchase from the company 
however  the company also markets to operators of larger convenience store chains and other retail outlets but such customers are primarily motivated by price 
due to increases in wholesale fuel prices in  the company was not able to be as aggressive in its pricing to these customers as in prior years 
although fuel sales increased  fuel margin declined significantly    from the prior year 
this decline was caused by substantially reduced retail fuel margins in as compared to the retail fuel margin was cents per gallon  a drop of from the cents per gallon realized in the reduced margin resulted from increases in wholesale prices that could not be fully passed on to retail customers due to competitive pressures from non traditional fuel retailers in the company s market areas  such as grocery stores that have installed fuel islands 
the reduced retail margin was experienced by the company throughout with the exception of its second fiscal quarter 
although the volumes of fuel sold on a wholesale basis declined  the wholesale margin per gallon increased by  from cents in to cents in the  decline in merchandise sales primarily relates to the decline in the average number of convenience stores and truck stop restaurants operated during the year 
the company continued its program of selling the merchandise operations of selected convenience stores to independent operators  with such sales in under this program  begun in mid  the company sells the merchandise operations of outlets that it believes will contribute more to its earnings if operated by independent operators than by the company 
the independent operators  because of their different overhead structure  are able to operate the stores less expensively than can the company 
these sales are structured such that the company retains the real estate or leasehold interest in the property and leases or subleases the land  building  and equipment to the operator 
the company also retains the motor fuel concession at these outlets  which become self service fuel outlets for the company 
the sales of these stores  offset to some extent by the conversion of certain gas only outlets to convenience stores  reduced the average number of convenience stores operated during the year by 
in addition  the company leased the restaurant facilities at two of its truck stops to independent operators in early total merchandise gross profit also declined due to the sales declines  however  the margin on merchandise sales increased slightly in  to from 
shortly after year end  the company reorganized its retail operations placing convenience stores and truck stops  and their related food service operations  under the supervision of one executive 
management believes this supervisory structure will increase the focus on improving merchandise margins and sales levels in its outlets 
although miscellaneous revenues in total were relatively unchanged between and  the composition of the revenues shifted 
gains on the sales of merchandise operations at convenience stores increased to  from  while check cashing fees  food stamp commissions  and other revenues related to check cashing booths declined  due to closing eight such outlets 
in addition  the company recognized a one time gain of  from the sale of a fleet fueling franchise in other items included in miscellaneous revenue  such as lottery commissions and money order fees  were relatively unchanged between the periods 
direct store expenses consist of those costs directly attributable to the operation of the company s retail outlets  such as salaries and other personnel costs  supplies  utilities  repairs and maintenance  and commissions paid to the operators of the self service motor fuel outlets 
these costs declined  in from this decline was due to the reduction in the average number of convenience stores operated during and to the closure of the eight check cashing outlets  both discussed above  offset by increased fuel commissions paid to operators of the company s self service fuel outlets due to an increase in the number of this type of outlet 
the company leases the land or land and buildings at of its retail locations from affiliates of the general partner 
as is customary in these types of agreements  these leases provide for adjustments in the monthly rent based on the change in the consumer price index 
the adjustments are made every five years with the next adjustment to be effective beginning in may although the index on which the upcoming adjustment will be based has not yet been published  the company anticipates that the rents paid for these locations will increase by approximately  annually beginning in may general and administrative expenses declined  in as compared to the prior year principally due to declines in salaries and bad debts although all categories of costs except legal and professional fees declined slightly or were flat compared to the modest increase in depreciation and amortization expense relates to the increases in the company s fixed assets over the last few years 
because of the significant asset additions during the current year  principally related to environmental upgrades at the company s retail locations and to improvements at the fuel terminal acquired in early  which is expected to begin operating in the first quarter  it is expected that depreciation and amortization in future years will increase from the current level 
interest expense was relatively unchanged in from the prior year  increasing  
although the company s total debt long and short term and capital leases increased by a total of  interest rates were somewhat lower in than  much of the additional indebtedness was incurred late in the year  and a significant portion of the debt was incurred to finance renovation of the fuel terminal and the interest expense related thereto was capitalized 
the company expects that its interest expense will increase in over due to the rise in its debt levels  and  when the fuel terminal begins operating  the debt incurred to finance its renovation will begin to be expensed 
if general interest rate increases occur  such increases will  of course  increase the company s interest expense as much of the company s debt carries a floating rate 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for income taxes sfas at the beginning of fiscal as a result of adopting this accounting principle  the company is required to record deferred income tax expense attributable to changes arising in the current period in the temporary differences between financial and tax reporting which are expected to reverse after  when the company will become taxable as a corporation 
these differences are due primarily to temporary differences between the financial reporting amounts and tax bases of the company s property and equipment 
in  the company recorded deferred income taxes of  an increase of  over the previous year 
of the total for the current year   was related to a change in the lives used by the company to depreciate certain buildings for income tax reporting purposes 
in august  congress passed legislation clarifying that certain buildings used in connection with the retail sale of motor fuel qualified for a substantially shorter depreciable life for tax purposes than was being utilized by the company 
substantially all of the buildings owned by the company qualified for this shorter life 
in january  the internal revenue service issued a notice explaining how the tax deduction related to the change in the depreciable lives on these assets should be determined 
as a result  the company will take a tax deduction for the difference between the tax depreciation previously recorded and the depreciation available using the shorter life 
however  it must record deferred taxes on this timing difference 
if the company were a taxable entity  the deferred tax charge would have been offset by a current tax credit of an equal amount with no impact on the company s reported net income 
however  since the company is a partnership and does not report any current income tax expense or credit  the current tax benefit of this deduction will be allocated to the company s unitholders 
the deferred tax expense not related to the above described clarification in the tax law  was  an increase of  over the expense reported in and is principally due to additions to fixed assets which are depreciated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes 
the deferred tax expense is expected to grow in as the date at which the company will become taxable as a corporation grows closer since fewer of the differences between tax and financial reporting will reverse prior to such date and because of the significantly increased tax deduction available for the deprecation of many of the company s buildings 
however  the  expense related to the catch up in depreciation discussed above will not recur 
the company s reported a net loss of  in  as compared to net income of  in primarily due to significant impact of reduced retail fuel margins and to the non recurring deferred tax provision related to the change in the depreciable lives of certain buildings for tax purposes 
compared with the company s motor fuel revenues for increased over the period by  due to increased wholesale fuel sales 
wholesale fuel sales increased  gallons over this increase resulted from a full year of sales from a marketing arrangement begun in mid that emphasizes sales to contractors and other commercial users of fuel as well as from growth in these sales 
however  the increase in wholesale fuel sales was offset by a decline in retail fuel sales 
motor fuel sales at the company s retail outlets declined by  gallons as a result of lower sales volumes at the company s truck stops due to increased competition from new outlets in several of the company s markets 
the margin on fuel sales increased  in over this increase resulted from improved retail fuel margins cents in vs cents in and the additional margin from the increased wholesale activity 
merchandise sales in declined by  from the previous year due principally to the sale of the merchandise operations at ten convenience stores under the company s program of selling these operations to independent operators 
the merchandise sales decline was also affected by the absence of a full year s sales at the outlets whose merchandise operations were sold in the third and fourth quarters of the company also experienced a decline in its average weekly per store sales for convenience stores of in as compared to and a decline of in sales at the truck stops combined with their associated restaurants 
these declines are attributable to the company s efforts to increase the margin on merchandise sales at all of its outlets 
total merchandise margin declined by  due to the reduced merchandise sales but the gross profit percentage on merchandise sales increased to from reflecting the company s program of selectively increasing prices on less price sensitive items 
miscellaneous revenues were up  in over this increase resulted primarily from increases in excise tax handling fees due to increased fuel volumes and money order fees due to increased numbers of items sold and an increase in the per item fee and a gain recognized from the sale of the company s fleet fuel franchise offset by declines in food stamp commissions due to the adoption in texas of a debit card for this activity and in commissions on the wholesale sale of cigarettes due to a more competitive market 
direct store expenses in declined  from the prior year 
this reduction was due to the elimination of payroll and related costs  utilities  and other operating expenses at the convenience stores whose merchandise operations were sold to independent operators offset by increases in the fuel commissions paid to the operators of those stores  and increases in wage and other personnel costs at the stores operated by the company 
general and administrative expenses increased  in over this increase was caused by increased professional fees  principally attributable to the cost of consultants assisting in reorganizing certain of the company s back office processes  increased rental expense  associated with the company s increased use of leases to provide vehicles and to finance certain equipment  increased insurance costs  and increases in bank charges  associated with the trial use of a deposit pick up service at the company s convenience stores and truck stops 
these increases were offset by a reduction in bad debt expense due to better monitoring of receivables 
the  decline in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the continued full depreciation of assets acquired upon the company s formation in and the somewhat limited additions to property and equipment over the past few years 
even though the company s long term bank debt declined by  from to  interest expense was flat between the two years due to increased use of capital leases  which carry a somewhat higher but fixed interest rate  to fund capital expenditures 
the increase in the deferred tax expense in as compared to is principally due to additions to fixed assets which are depreciated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes 
the  decline in the company s total margin in as compared to was offset by significant reductions in operating expenses and depreciation and amortization such that income before income taxes and other items increased  
however  due to the increase in deferred income taxes  discussed above  and the occurrence in of a  gain from the early extinguishment of debt in connection with the refinancing of the company s bank debt in early  net income increased by  between the two years 
liquidity and capital resources the company has a credit agreement with a major bank under which it has a  revolving credit line to be used for working capital purposes and two term loans 
the revolving credit line bears interest at the bank s prime rate and matures on april   but the agreement requires that the outstanding balance be paid down to  or less for three consecutive days during each calendar quarter 
one of the term loans had a balance at year end of  and is due in quarterly installments of  through march  the other term loan had a year end balance of  and is due on a payment schedule which requires aggregate payments of  in and  in payments in subsequent years increase to a maximum of  annually in the final year of the loan which matures on march  both term loans bear interest at libor plus fixed at approximately day intervals 
although the interest rates on the term loans are variable  the credit agreement provides the company with the ability to fix the rates on all or a portion of the loans for varying periods of time up to their maturity 
the credit agreement contains various requirements and restrictive covenants  including a pledge of the company s accounts receivable and inventories  a negative pledge of its fixed assets  limits on capital expenditures  and limits on cash distributions to of net income as reported for generally accepted accounting principles  and the requirement to maintain certain financial ratios 
at year end  the company was not in compliance with certain of the financial ratios and covenants in the credit agreement 
however  the bank has waived compliance with these ratios or amended the credit agreement with respect to these items 
during  the company made aggregate cash distributions to its unitholders of  per unit 
however  the distributions were not made at regular  periodic intervals nor at fixed amounts 
the company anticipates that it will make cash distributions to unitholders in however  no determination has made with respect to the amount of any such distributions  or the date s on which such distributions might be made 
any future distributions will be dependent upon the profitability of the company  its debt service requirements  needs for capital expenditures  and compliance with the restrictions in its credit agreement 
beginning in  the company will become taxable as a corporation unless alternative structures are implemented 
accordingly  funds available for distribution will be reduced by any income taxes that may be incurred by the company 
see change in structure of company 
the company s cash flows from operating activities were  less in than in this decline was due principally to the  decline in net income offset by the significant increase in deferred taxes related to the change in depreciable lives for certain buildings for tax purposes and the increased gain on the sales of the merchandise operations of certain convenience stores 
cash used to purchase property and equipment increased  in due to expenditures to acquire and renovate the fuel terminal acquired by the company in early and to continued environmental upgrades at the company s retail outlets 
the company will invest additional funds to complete the renovation of the terminal in  although the amount expended should be substantially less than was spent in expenditures for environmental upgrading at the retail outlets should continue at about the same pace in and as in but should decline significantly thereafter as all environmental upgrading must be completed by year end the company has contracted with a firm to install the necessary equipment and or to modify existing installations to meet current environmental requirements by the december deadline 
the cost of this upgrading is expected to be between  to  and will be incurred during and the company will pay for some of its expected capital expenditures from operating cash flow and expects to finance a portion of the expenditures by utilizing lease lines of credit  as it has in the past 
the company s financing activities provided  of cash in this amount represents a change of  from levels due to a net increase of  in aggregate debt balances due on the company s revolving credit line  its long term debt  and its capital lease obligations and a reduction of  in the amount of distributions paid to unitholders 
the reduced distributions to unitholders resulted from the decline in the company s earnings in the company is party to commodity futures contracts and forward contracts to buy and sell fuel  both of which are used principally to satisfy balances owed on exchange agreements 
both of these types of contracts have off balance sheet risk as they involve the risk of dealing with others and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts and the risk associated with unmatched positions and market fluctuations 
the open positions under these contracts were not significant at year end see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had negative working capital at year end of  an increase of  from this change resulted primarily from increases in the current portion of the company s short and long term debt and capital leases 
the company has received a proposal to refinance its debt which would provide for an increase in the term debt available to the company and a longer amortization of such debt 
the company believes that this or a similar refinancing of its debt will be accomplished during and that such refinancing will enhance its working capital position 
the company has tradtionally been able to operate its business with negative working capital  principally because most sales are for cash and it has received payment terms from vendors 
consequently  even if a refinancing is not completed  the company believes that the availability of funds under its revolving line of credit and its traditional use of trade credit will permit operations to be conducted in a customary manner 
inflation and seasonality the company believes inflation has not had a material effect on operating results in recent years except for the upward pressure placed on wages  primarily store wages  by the federal minimum wage increase which took effect in the additional increase in the minimum wage scheduled for october will again place pressure on the level of store wages 
however  the company expects that operating margins will be adversely affected for only a limited time as it believes that prices can be increased fairly quickly in order to pass along this increased cost to customers 
the company does not believe it will be at a competitive disadvantage as it believes its wage structure is in line with that of other convenience store operators 
apart from the impact of the minimum wage increase and the scheduled rent increases discussed earlier  operations for the foreseeable future are also not expected to be significantly impacted by inflation 
generally  increased costs of in store merchandise can be quickly reflected in higher prices to customers 
the price of motor fuel  adjusted for inflation  has declined over recent years 
however  significant increases in the retail price of motor fuels could reduce fuel demand and the company s gross profit on fuel sales 
the company s businesses are subject to seasonal influences  with higher sales being experienced in the second and third quarters of the year as customers tend to purchase more motor fuel and convenience items  such as soft drinks  other beverages  and snack items  during the warmer months 
change in structure of company under current tax law  the company will become taxable as a corporation beginning in this change  which was included in revisions to the internal revenue code  would mean that the company would begin paying taxes and that any distributions made to the unitholders would be treated as corporate dividends 
in connection with this change  the company has been studying various alternative structures 
the options available to it include converting its current operations to a corporate form  which will in effect occur if the company takes no other action  placing its retail and other operations that do not generate qualifying income as defined in the tax code in a separate corporate subsidiary and continuing the operation of its remaining activities as a publicly traded limited partnership  or placing its retail operations and its real estate holdings into separate corporations  distributing the interests in those corporations to its unitholders  and qualifying the company holding the real estate interests as a real estate investment trust reit 
as stated above  a decision has not yet been made regarding restructuring the company and management is continuing to evaluate the foregoing and other alternatives available to it 
one of the primary considerations affecting any decision is that the restructuring be accomplished in a manner so as to qualify as a tax free transaction for the company and its unitholders
