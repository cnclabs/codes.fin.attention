the corporation s loan portfolio largely reflects the profile of the communities in which it operates 
the corporation essentially makes four types of loans agricultural  commercial  real estate  and installment 
the corporation has no foreign loans 
the following table summarizes the corporation s loan portfolio 
december of of of of of amount total amount total amount total amount total amount total agricultural      commercial      real estate family residences      agricultural      construction     commercial      real estate total      installment      total loans      total assets      loans to total assets total loans increased million or in as compared to an increase of million or in as in  loan growth occurred through demand in existing markets rather than through acquisitions 
the agricultural loan portfolio increased million or in from the agricultural portfolio grew as customers updated equipment  purchased additional farmland  and borrowed additional operating funds due to increased production costs 
from to  the portfolio increased million in volume 
as of year end  the corporation had million in agricultural loans guaranteed by the farm service agency formerly farmers home administration 
was a year of extremes in corn production economics as short supplies  strong demand  and weather concerns for the crop resulted in corn prices at all time record highs  above per bushel 
soybean prices  to a lesser degree  also experienced favorable prices 
due to the corporation s market area s quality land  the majority of our customers experienced average or above yields 
profitability in the livestock sector continued to be pressured by high feed costs 
strong pork prices offset the feed costs  but cattle feeders experienced another difficult year 
while agricultural loan volume has continued to increase over the past few years  the percentage of total loans in agricultural production and agricultural real estate loans has decreased from in to in this reflects the increased diversification of the portfolio 
short term commercial loans increased million or in this compares to a reduction of million or in while business activity remains strong in markets served by the corporation  a large share of the commercial loan demand has been for the acquisition or construction of longer term assets  such as real estate loans 
competition for high quality commercial and agricultural customers remains strong 
real estate loan volume continued to increase in  posting an million or increase over during  residential loans increased million to million 
these loans comprise the largest single component of the portfolio at 
agricultural real estate loans posted an increase of million or in a very competitive market 
commercial real estate loans grew million or 
construction loans increased million  primarily in the commercial sector 
increased loan volumes reflect the high level of business expansion in the corporation s market areas and successful sales efforts on the part of the staff 
direct and indirect installment loans loans to consumers reflect little change in volume in the portfolio in this follows an increase of in to the corporation implemented new products and marketing programs during the past three years to increase penetration into its market areas 
long term  these products and programs are expected to provide increased diversification of risk and enhanced profitability 
increased focus on underwriting quality and awareness of general consumer debt levels has tempered growth in this area of the bank s portfolio 
although the risk of non payment for any reason exists with respect to all loans  certain other more specific risks are associated with each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans are quality of the borrower s management and the impact of national economic factors 
with respect to agricultural loans  the primary risks are weather and  like commercial loans  quality of borrower s management 
risks associated with real estate loans include concentrations of loans in a loan type  such as commercial or agricultural  and fluctuating land values 
installment loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan 
installment loans additionally face the risk of a borrower s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
the corporation s strategy with respect to addressing and managing these types of risks  whether loan demand is weak or strong  is for the subsidiary bank to follow its conservative loan policies and underwriting practices  which include i granting loans on a sound and collectible basis  ii investing funds profitably for the benefit of the stockholders and the protection of depositors  iii serving the legitimate needs of the community and the bank s general market area while obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk  iv ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan  v administering loan policies through a directors loan committee and officers loan committees  vi developing and maintaining adequate diversification of the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each loan category  and vii ensuring that each loan is properly documented and  if appropriate  secured or guaranteed by government agencies  and that insurance coverage is adequate  especially with respect to certain agricultural loans because of the risk of poor weather 
non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans amounted to 
of total loans at year end compared to 
at year end the overall low level of non performing loans is a reflection of the bank s lending staff  credit policies and management s emphasis on asset quality 
potential problem credits are closely monitored by the lending staff  and an independent loan review staff provides further assistance in identifying problem situations 
loans over days past due are normally either charged off  or if well secured and in the process of collection  placed on a non accrual status 
reflecting the corporation s sound credit policies  the allowance for possible loan losses was of non performing loans at year end the corporation does not have any significant concentration of commercial real estate loans or commitments in areas which are experiencing deteriorating economic conditions 
total other real estate owned as of december  was the corporation had no other real estate owned as of december  the following table provides information on the corporation s non performing loans since december non accrual  days past due and accruing restructured total non performing  loans non performing loans to total loans net of unearned interest table as of december  and  loans which the corporation s management had serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms that were not carried as non performing loans totaled approximately or 
of the total loan portfolio  and or 
of the total loan portfolio  respectively 
allowance for possible loan losses 
the allowance shown in the following table represents a general allowance available to absorb future losses within the entire portfolio 
year ended december amount of loans outstanding at end of period net of unearned interest      average amount of loans outstanding for the period net of unearned interest      allowance for possible loan losses at beginning of period      allowance of bank acquired charge offs agricultural commercial real estate mortgage installment  total charge offs  recoveries agricultural commercial real estate mortgage installment total recoveries net loans charged off recoveries provision credit for possible loan losses allowance for possible loan losses at end of period      net loans charged off recoveries to average loans allowance for possible loan losses to non performing loans allowance for possible loan losses to total loans at end of period net of unearned interest the allowance for possible loan losses is based on factors that include the overall composition of the loan portfolio  types of loans  past loss experience  loan delinquencies  potential substandard and doubtful loans  and such other factors that  in management s best judgment  deserve evaluation in estimating possible loan losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses is monitored monthly during the ongoing  systematic review of the loan portfolio by the loan review staff of the audit department of the subsidiary bank 
the results of these reviews are reported to the board of directors of the subsidiary bank on a monthly basis and to the board of directors of the corporation on a quarterly basis 
monitoring and addressing problem loan situations are primarily the responsibility of the subsidiary bank s management and its board of directors 
more specifically  the corporation calculates the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses on a monthly basis using historical charge offs for each loan type  substandard loans  and anticipated losses with respect to specific loans 
the amount in the allowance is based on the amount of outstanding loans for each loan type multiplied by the ratio of actual charge offs to total loans for each loan type for the preceding five years  plus the amount of anticipated losses with respect to specific loans  plus a percentage of identified substandard or delinquent loans for each loan type 
in addition to management s assessment of the portfolio  the corporation and the subsidiary bank are examined periodically by regulatory agencies 
although the regulatory agencies do not determine whether the subsidiary bank s allowance for possible loan losses is adequate  such agencies do review the procedures and policies followed by management of the subsidiary bank in establishing the allowance 
reflecting the corporation s emphasis on asset quality  net charge offs were 
of average total loans in  and the allowance for possible loan losses at year end was million  
of total loans  net of unearned interest  and of non performing loans 
management considers the allowance for possible loan losses adequate to meet potential losses as of december  during the period through  the subsidiary bank charged off a significant dollar amount of loans as a result of aggressive growth during the late s and early s and a severe recession in the agricultural sector of the economy in the mid s 
strict implementation of conservative credit policies that emphasize stringent underwriting criteria for new loans  in conjunction with vigorous collection efforts  resulted in recoveries on loans previously charged off exceeding charge offs in and in  for the first time in seven years  the corporation took a provision for possible loan losses  a result of direct and indirect installment loan charge offs during while the significant increase in installment loan volume the past three years led to somewhat higher dollar losses  management has strengthened installment loan underwriting practices thereby reversing this trend 
investment securities 
the objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide the corporation with a source of liquidity and a source of earnings 
the following table provides information on the book value of investment securities as of the dates indicated 
december us treasury    us government agencies    obligations of state and political    subdivisions other securities    total    total investment securities decreased by million to million or at december  compared to december  the major reason for the decrease is due to the need to respond to increased loan demand 
increases totaling million occurred in the us treasury category while decreases totaling million occurred in the us government agencies category 
the lack of adequate spread on non callable us government agencies was the major reason for the shift to us treasuries from us government agencies 
primarily as a result of loan demand  securities decreased by million  to million or  at december  compared to december  deposits 
total average deposits increased million or from to as a result of the sandwich acquisition during interest bearing demand deposits were the only type of deposit to decrease in million 
this reflects a continued trend by customers to invest liquid funds into securities and other non bank products 
average time deposits increased approximately million in  primarily a result of the sandwich acquisition  in spite of approximately million of out of the area brokered deposits acquired from hoiic being allowed to run off in during  average non interest bearing demand deposits rose million  a increase 
non interest bearing demand deposits have grown steadily since  increasing by million or as a result of acquisitions and continued efforts by the subsidiary bank to develop core deposits 
the average interest rate paid on deposits in decreased to  down from in  primarily as a result of the decline in the rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits 
average deposits decreased million from to 
the following table sets forth the classification of average deposits and rates from the indicated periods 
for the year ending december average average average balance rate balance rate balance rate non interest bearing demand  n a  n a  n a interest bearing demand now and money market    savings    time deposits    total the following table summarizes time deposits in amounts of or more by time remaining until maturity as of december  these time deposits are made by individuals  corporations  and public entities 
three months or less  over three through six months  over six months through one year  over one year  total  liquidity 
liquidity is measured by a financial institution s ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital  or the sale of assets 
additional sources of liquidity  including cash flow from both the repayment of loans and the securitization of assets  are also considered in determining whether liquidity is satisfactory 
the funds are used to meet deposit withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  fund loans  and operate the organization 
liquidity is achieved through growth of core funds including core deposits defined below  of non public entity certificates of deposit over  and repurchase agreements issued to commercial customers and liquid assets  and accessibility to the money and capital markets 
the ratio of temporary investments those maturing within one year  plus twelve months projected payments on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations to volatile liabilities of non public entity certificates of deposit over  repurchase agreements issued to public entities  and deposits of public entities was at december  compared to at december  core deposits  defined as demand deposits  now accounts  total savings  and certificates of deposit less than  were of total deposits at december   and of total deposits at december  money market accounts of approximately million at december   are classified by the corporation as core deposits 
the corporation experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million in net cash provided by operating activities of million provided a degree of liquidity 
financing activities provided net cash of million 
a net increase of million in deposits  the result of the sandwich acquisition  was a major component of the financing activities 
increases in the operating and financing activities were offset by net cash used for investing activities of million 
net loan growth of million in was the major component of this decrease  with payment for the sandwich acquisition representing another million of the net cash used for investing activities 
net cash of million provided by securities transactions million in proceeds from sales of securities and million from maturities of securities  less million in purchases of securities partially offset the cash used by the aforementioned categories of investing activities 
cash and cash equivalents of million at december   are deemed adequate to meet short term liquidity needs 
the cash flows generated by the operating and investing activities and used by the financing activities of the corporation in resulted in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
investing activities contributed million toward the increase in cash and cash equivalents 
proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities of million more than offset the purchase of investment securities of million  and the substantial growth of million experienced in the loan portfolio 
financing activities used million of the funds generated  with the growth of short term borrowings most notably repurchase agreements only partially offsetting the decrease in deposits during the course of the long term liquidity needs of the corporation will be driven by the necessity to grow and change in the marketplace to meet the needs of its customers and to offset strategies of its competitors 
the corporation s equity base  along with its low debt level and common stock available for issuance  provide several options for future financing 
proceeds from the sale of securities were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
proceeds from maturing securities were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
asset liability management 
the corporation actively manages its assets and liabilities through coordinating the levels of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize changes in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates 
the corporation defines interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as any instrument that can be repriced within days  either because the instrument will mature during the period or because it carries a variable interest rate 
changes in net interest income occur when interest rates on loans and investments change in a different time period from that of changes in interest rates on liabilities  or when the mix and volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities change 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the dollar amount of difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities within a given time period gap 
a gap ratio is determined by dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
a ratio of indicates a perfectly matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements would be zero 
the corporation s strategy with respect to asset liability management is to maximize net interest income while limiting the corporation s exposure to risks associated with volatile interest rates 
the subsidiary bank s funds management committee is responsible for monitoring the subsidiary bank s gap position 
as a general rule  the subsidiary bank s policy is to maintain gap as a percent of total assets within a range from to in any given time period 
based on the simulation of various rising or falling interest rate scenarios in comparison to one considered to be the most likely interest rate scenario  management seeks to operate with net interest income within a range of to of budgeted net interest income during any twelve month period 
the funds management committee monitors the effect of changes in yields and rates paid on a monthly basis 
the committee considers the subsidiary bank s current and anticipated positions during the next twelve months and the effect of rising and falling interest rate scenarios on net income 
the committee considers various contingency plans if the results of this analysis with regard to the following key ratios indicate a deviation from the funds management policy loans to assets  net loans to core funds  net loans to total deposits  equity capital to total assets  rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities  gap  temporary investments to total assets  and temporary investments to volatile liabilities 
the contingency plans considered by the committee include generating funds through internal and external sources  adjusting maturities within the investment portfolio  repricing of assets  purchasing or selling loans  secondary mortgage activity and liability rate adjustment 
the committee reports the results of their meetings to the subsidiary bank s board of directors on a monthly basis

management of the corporation considers one half of the now account balances one of the components of interest bearing demand deposits and all savings deposits as core  or non rate sensitive deposits  primarily since interest bearing demand and savings deposits historically have not been rate sensitive 
as a general rule  the subsidiary bank s policy is to maintain rsa as a percent of rsl within a range of to within a day time period 
at december   one half of the now account balances totaled approximately million and savings deposits totaled approximately million 
if the amounts reflected in the month timeframe are adjusted to exclude these amounts  rate sensitive liabilities would be approximately million for a negative gap of approximately million

effects of inflation 
the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation
