the company was formed in as an authorized reseller of computer hardware and software products  and since  has been developing and offering related it services 
to date  most of the company s net sales have been derived from it product sales 
in  net product sales were and services and support revenue was of the company s net sales 
the company has entered into distribution agreements with microage and ingram  two of the nation s largest aggregators  to acquire most of its it products for resale 
the company s relationship with microage commenced in  and as customer demand for it products grew  the company initiated its relationship with ingram in the distribution agreements with microage and ingram give the company access to such aggregators extensive inventories and provide the company with electronic ordering capability  product configuration and testing  warehousing and delivery 
in general  the company orders it products  including workstations  servers  microcomputers  networking and communications equipment  and applications software from such aggregators on an as needed basis  thereby reducing the company s need to carry large inventories 
during  the company acquired approximately and of its products for resale from microage and ingram  respectively 
in general  there are no ongoing written commitments by customers to purchase products from the company and all product sales are made on a purchase order basis 
furthermore  as the market for it products has matured  price competition has intensified and is likely to continue to intensify 
the company s gross profits  margins and results of operations could be adversely affected by such continued product pricing pressure  a significant reduction in product purchase orders from the company s customers  or a disruption in the company s sources of product supply 
the company offers network consulting including systems integration  workstation support  education  communications installation and it staffing services 
services and support revenue is recognized as such services are performed 
the company s network consulting  workstation support and communications installation services are billed on a time and materials basis 
the company s education and it staffing services are fee based on a per course and per placement basis  respectively 
generally  the company s service arrangements with its customers may be terminated by such customers with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
the most significant cost relating to the services component of the company s business is personnel expenses which consist of salaries  benefits and payroll related expenses 
thus  the financial performance of the company s service business is based primarily upon billing margins billable hourly rates less the costs to the company of such service personnel on an hourly basis and utilization rates billable hours divided by paid hours 
the future success of the services component of the company s business will depend in large part upon its ability to maintain high utilization rates at profitable billing margins 
the company s utilization rates for service personnel likely will be adversely affected during periods of rapid and concentrated hiring 
in addition  the competition for quality technical personnel has continued to intensify resulting in increased personnel costs for the company and many other it service providers  which has adversely affected the company s billing margins 
the company s cost of sales includes primarily  in the case of product sales  the cost to the company of products acquired for resale  and in the case of services and support revenue  salaries and related expenses for billable technical personnel 
the company s selling expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including sales commissions earned by employees involved in the sales of it products  services and support

sales commissions are recorded as revenue is recognized 
general and administrative expenses consist of all other operating expenses  including primarily salaries and occupancy costs for administrative  executive and finance personnel 
commencing with the fourth quarter and year end results  certain indirect costs which previously were classified as costs of services and support have been reclassified to general and administrative expenses to conform with current industry practices

the company believes that its ability to provide a broad range of technical services  coupled with its traditional strength in satisfying its clients it product requirements and its long term relationships with large clients  positions the company to continue to grow the services component of its business  while further strengthening its product sales 
as such  the company anticipates that an increasing percentage of its gross profits in the future will be derived from the services and support component of its business 
however  in the near term  the company believes that product sales will continue to generate a significantly larger percentage of the company s gross profit  particularly due to the acquisition of certain assets and the business of lior in july see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of such acquisition  the company s sales of it products increased substantially in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  the company has begun to provide services and support to the lior customers  which previously had purchased primarily computer products from lior 
the company believes that its ability to be a single source provider of it products  services and support enables it to earn margins higher than it would earn if it sold products only

net sales increased by  or million  from million in to million in product sales increased by  or million  from million in to million in this increase was attributable primarily to increased demand from the company s established customer base and to product sales resulting from the company s july acquisition of certain assets and the business of lior 
services and support revenue increased by  or million  from million in to million in this increase was attributable primarily to increased demand for the company s service and support offerings  particularly its network consulting services  due to an increase in the number and size of client projects

the company expects that downward pricing pressure on products will continue and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain its margins on product sales in the future 
in addition  gross profit margin on product sales in the first half of was positively impacted by certain higher margin product sales 
gross profit margin attributable to services and support revenue decreased from of services and support revenue in to in the decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable primarily to the fact that services and support revenue increased at a slower rate than related personnel and recruiting costs  as the company accelerated the hiring and training of technical personnel in anticipation of the increased demand for its services

many factors  some of which are not within the company s control  have contributed and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include the short term nature of the company s customers commitments  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing  size  and mix of product and service orders and deliveries  the timing and size of new projects  including projects for new customers  pricing changes in response to various competitive factors  market factors affecting the availability of qualified technical personnel  timing and customer acceptance of new product and service offerings  changes in trends affecting outsourcing of it services  disruption in sources of supply  changes in material  personnel  and other operating costs  and industry and general economic conditions 
the company also believes that  to a limited degree  its business is seasonal with a greater proportion of the company s product sales occurring in the fourth quarter due to the capital budgeting and spending patterns of some of its larger customers 
operating results have been and may in the future also be affected by the cost  timing and other effects of acquisitions  including the mix of product and service revenues of acquired companies 
the company believes  therefore  that past operating results and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future operating performance 
the company experienced a decline in its results of operations during the quarter ended june  primarily due to a decrease in gross profit margin on product sales attributable to industry wide downward pricing pressure on product sales and increases in certain volume discounts and to a decrease in gross profit margin on services and support revenue resulting from the fact that such revenue increased at a slower rate than related costs due to the accelerated hiring and training of technical personnel and lower utilization rates 
product sales in the third and fourth quarter of increased significantly due  in part to  the acquisition of lior 
the company  however  does not expect product sales to continue to increase in to the same extent as they did in the third and fourth quarters of the company s operating results have been and in the future will continue to be impacted by changes in technical personnel billing and utilization rates 
many of the company s costs  particularly costs associated with services and support revenue  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed costs 
the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
technical personnel utilization rates have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected during periods of rapid and concentrated hiring 
depending upon the availability of qualified technical personnel  during periods of rapid growth the company has utilized and in the future is likely to utilize contract personnel  which also adversely affects gross margins 
due to these and other factors  if the company is successful in expanding its service offerings and revenue  periods of variability in utilization are likely to reoccur 
in addition  during such periods the company is likely to incur greater technical training costs 
quarterly results also may be impacted due to the fact that certain compensation based employment taxes are limited per employee per calendar year and  as a result  the company experiences a decrease in employment taxes as a percent of revenue during the calendar year 
backlog the company normally ships products within days of receiving an order and  therefore  does not customarily have a significant backlog

the company s cash used in operations was  for the year ended december  during  cash flow provided by operations was million 
however  during  cash used in operations was million which was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable arising from increased sales and  to a lesser extent  to an increase in inventories at december  the increase in inventories is attributable primarily to the purchase of computer equipment subject to firm purchase orders and then shipped to customers
