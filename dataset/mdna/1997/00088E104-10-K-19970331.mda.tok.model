actv s strategy is to generate revenues from the sale of actv programming that it either owns  has licensed or that has been created by a third party under a license from actv  including fees paid by subscribers to premium cable networks in which the company has an ownership interest 
the chief markets presently targeted by the company for actv s individualized programming are in home entertainment  education with an emphasis on distance learning and internet applications and site based entertainment 
the company seeks to exploit these markets  principally in the us  through licensing its individualized programming  by creating joint venture relationships  and by direct sales 
in december the company and fox sports net entered into a master programming agreement that extends through june  and covers all fox sports net programming 
the agreement grants the company the right to license fox sports net programming from each fox sports net regional sports network 
the company intends to enhance fox sports net s professional and college sports programs with its individualized programming 
under terms of the agreement  the company has the right to offer enhanced fox sports net programming to any distributor that carries the corresponding regional fox sports net channel 
in each region  the company and fox sports net will work together to develop innovative sports programming  which will be the basis for differentiated programming services offered by the company 
fox sports net will receive a share of subscriber fee and advertising revenue generated by future actv individualized television networks located within fox sports net regions 
fox sports net is the domestic telecasting arm of the worldwide sports alliance recently formed between news corporation  liberty media and telecommunications inc the network consists of seven owned and operated regional sports affiliates from coast to coast

sports and news programming for the trial were supplied to actv by fox sports west and cable news network  inc cnn  respectively 
the cable operator for the trial was tci of ventura county 
viewers participating in the trial were able to individualize cnn s primenews program  as well as fox sports west offerings such as la lakers basketball  la kings hockey  and california angels baseball 
based on the success of the los angeles trial  the company plans a commercial launch of two individualized networks the regional networks over the next twelve months within fox sports regions in texas and southern california 
fox sports southwest has million homes in texas  louisiana  arkansas  oklahoma and nine new mexico counties  while fox sports west reaches million subscribers in the region from los angeles to san diego and phoenix 
the planned regional networks  like the recently completed trial  will feature individualized fox sports regional programming

although the company s intention is to launch the regional networks over the next twelve month period  there is no assurance that it will secure the funding necessary to effect such launches  or that other factors might not delay or prohibit the successful implementation of the plan 
the company will direct initial marketing of the regional networks toward the cable operators in each respective fox sports net regional market who are buying digital set top boxes 
expansion could follow in either additional fox sports net regions or in other regional sports markets 
the company has established four new wholly owned subsidiaries that would serve as operators of additional regional individualized networks covering the san francisco  chicago  new york  and atlanta regions in the event that the company decides to expand and provide the individualized television programming to other regions across the us to date  the four new wholly owned subsidiaries have not engaged in any business activities 
the recently complete trial  and the projected regional network expansion  is part of the company s plan to develop the entertainment division of its business  which to date  does not generate any revenue for the company 
there can be no assurance that the regional networks  even if launched  will generate significant revenues for the company
