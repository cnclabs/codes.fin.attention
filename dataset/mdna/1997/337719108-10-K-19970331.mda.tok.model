the company s newest products are directed towards medical specialties in which image guided  minimally invasive therapies are replacing open surgical procedures 
these products are used primarily in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer  heart disease and vascular disease 
the company also designs and manufactures specialty x ray imaging components and subsystems for several leading medical products companies as an oem and sells general radiology systems for use in hospitals  clinics and physicians offices 
the company experienced break even operating results in with losses in the second half of the year 
the company cannot predict when it will return to profitability  although it has taken significant steps to reduce costs and improve sales during improvement in the company s results of operations will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products and the ability of the company to maintain or increase gross margins  reduce its manufacturing and other costs  particularly at its chicago facility  enter into distribution arrangements for its mammotest products and other products  implement its marketing and sales strategies in the united states and internationally  maintain orders under oem agreements  renew oem agreements on favorable terms and develop and introduce new products that compete successfully 
the company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in net revenues  operating results and net income  depending on such factors as the timing of large system shipments to customers  the timing of orders under oem contracts and related manufacturing and shipment scheduling  new product introductions and new marketing programs by the company and its competitors  delays in contract development projects  the effect of economic conditions on the company s markets  the effects of managed healthcare on capital expenditures and reimbursement  increases in marketing and research costs in relation to sales  regulatory clearance of new products  seasonal purchasing patterns of hospitals and the timing of purchasing decisions by customers 
additionally  because the timing of the occurrence of such factors is difficult to anticipate and many of the company s costs are fixed  the company may not be able to sufficiently reduce its costs in periods when its revenues are less than anticipated and may suffer unexpected losses or lower income in these periods 
the company is attempting to expand its international sales and marketing efforts  which can be expected to result in losses from its international operations until its international revenues reach sufficient levels 
additionally  the company s exposure to the risks of international business  including foreign currency risks  may increase as its international business grows 
the company attempts to minimize these risks through measures including  but not limited to  requiring payments in u 
s 
dollars and the use of dollar denominated letters of credit 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in its international sales efforts or in minimizing any associated risks 
during the last six months of  the company s sales of its mammotest breast biopsy systems were flat when compared to the comparable six month period of the company faced aggressive and successful competition within the surgical stereotactic core needle breast biopsy market from u 
s 
surgical corporation 
u 
s 
surgical introduced a millimeter inch diameter tissue removal system which is sold with a stereotactic table manufactured by lorad on a private label basis 
these competitive actions limited the company s ability to increase sales of its stereotactic tables 
additionally  orders from oem customers were lower than expected  resulting in lower sales and lower absorption of the company s fixed manufacturing costs 
improving factory utilization and further reducing operating expenses will be key elements in efforts to restore the company to acceptable levels of profitability 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the timing or ultimate success of such efforts 
the company expects to continue to face aggressive competition in the stereotactic breast biopsy market and is experiencing further decreases in the sales of its mammotest systems in the first quarter of the company may not regain momentum in this market until it enters into a distribution partnership that adequately addresses this market 
the company also expects sales under its oem arrangements to be less in early than in comparable prior periods 
due to severance and other factors  it is also unlikely that the company s efforts to reduce its operating expenses will have a favorable impact on its operating results until after the first quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net revenues represented by certain data included in the company s statements of operations for the periods indicated percentage of net revenues year ended december  net revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  marketing and service general and administrative restructuring provision total operating expenses earnings loss from operations interest expense interest income other income  net
