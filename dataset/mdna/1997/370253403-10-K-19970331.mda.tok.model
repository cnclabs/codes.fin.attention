overview general magic has developed two platform technologies  magic cap and telescript 
the market for devices incorporating magic cap has been slow to develop and the company has not generated significant royalty revenues in connection with its magic cap licensing efforts to date 
in addition  the internet has emerged as the public data communications network of choice  thereby reducing the market opportunity for the proprietary telescript platform 
to respond to these developments  general magic has redirected its business strategy 
it is developing and marketing an advanced network service based on internet  computing and telecommunications standards 
the network service is designed to provide an integrated communications and information management solution to mobile business professionals and other consumers 
the company continues to work with its licensees to deliver products that incorporate magic cap technology  and to develop its agent technology for internet applications 
as a result of the redirection of its strategy  general magic believes it will derive future revenues principally from the sale of its products and network services 
the company is at an early stage of development in its new business strategy and is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  establish technical feasibility and complete development of its software technology  enter into key partnering arrangements  respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the company s decision to focus its efforts as a provider of an advanced network service is predicated on the assumption that in the future  the number of users of the company s network service will be large enough to permit the company to operate profitably 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumption will be correct or that the company will be able to successfully compete as a network service provider 
any failure to achieve these goals could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
results of operations the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   and compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in in the fourth quarter of  the company announced and began to implement a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and achieve long term profitability in the company s operations 
as a result of the lack of demand for the company s products  primarily attributed to the emergence of the internet and the failure of the pic market to develop  the company adopted a new strategic direction and executed its restructuring plan 
the company expects that its operating results will fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to changes in the composition of the company s revenues  the timing of new product and service introductions by the company  its competitors and licensees  changes in the company s level of operating expenses  including the company s expenditures on research and development and promotional programs  development  production or quality problems on the part of the company or any of its licensees  and the amount and timing of recognition of one time license fees and royalties by licensees  as well as support and maintenance fees 
as a result of the change in the company s strategy  the timing of new customers for its products and services and the possible refund by the company of certain prepaid royalties  significant period fluctuations in the company s operating results  liquidity and capital resources may occur 
the company expects that the fluctuations in its revenue will result in inconsistent margin trends affected by changes in its revenue composition and the associated cost 
revenue total revenue was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower license fees for magic cap and telescript technologies 
the increase in compared to was due to increased license fees for both technologies to new customers in japan and europe 
the company s revenues currently consist of license fees and royalties for magic cap  telescript and software modem technologies and other revenue 
licensing revenue primarily represents revenue from nonrefundable  nonrecoupable licensing fees for the company s technologies and royalty revenue from original equipment manufacturers oem shipments of devices incorporating the company s technology 
licensing revenue associated with oem licensees is recognized upon shipment of the product incorporating the company s technology to the oem s customers provided that the collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
royalties associated with potential oem product returns is estimated and provided for in the period of sale 
other revenue represents fees earned under customer specific engineering  maintenance and support services contracts 
fees from customer specific engineering projects are recognized under the percentage of completion method based on achievement and acceptance of milestones or as services are performed 
support and maintenance fees are recognized over the period the service or maintenance is provided 
as the company redirects its efforts to the development and implementation of a network service business  the company expects its revenues will remain low throughout cost of other revenue cost of other revenue was million  million and none in  and  respectively 
cost of other revenue is related to revenue attributable to customer specific engineering projects  maintenance and support services 
it consisted primarily of personnel and equipment costs and fluctuates due to variable customer specific services 
research and development research and development expenses increased in to million from million in which represented a increase from expenses of million 
these increases supported the company s product development efforts and are primarily attributable to staffing needs  fees to outside contractors  depreciation  maintenance  and prototype development expenses 
to date  the company has expensed all software development costs as incurred 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in which represented a increase from expenses of million 
this increase was primarily due to increased marketing programs  expanding the company s domestic and international sales efforts and providing more licensee support 
additional administrative expenses related primarily to increased staffing and facility costs required to support headcount growth in through mid as a result of the restructuring plan  the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenditures in will decrease compared with levels 
write off of acquired technology and in process research and development in april  the company purchased rights to two internet applications from active paper  inc at that time  the purchase cost of million associated with this acquisition was capitalized 
on september   the company determined an impairment of this asset had occurred and recorded a million write off of the asset 
in july  the company acquired certain assets from conterra  inc for million  a significant portion of which was charged to in process research and development 
restructuring for information regarding the company s restructuring actions  see note to consolidated financial statements in item other income  net and income taxes for the years ended december   and  total other income  net was million  million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of interest income and expense 
the decrease in compared to was due to the company s declining cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances 
in addition  in the company began accruing for interest due under certain master license agreements 
the increase from to was due to interest income earned on short term investments of cash proceeds from the company s initial public offering of common stock in february future interest income is likely to decrease as cash equivalents and short term investments are consumed by the company s normal operating requirements  unless additional cash  if any  is generated through future financings 
income taxes  which amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to foreign withholding taxes on revenue generated from the company s japan based customers 
as of december   the company had available net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the loss carryforwards expire at various dates through as described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements in item  the utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards against taxable income in future periods may be subject to an annual limitation if a cumulative change in ownership of more than of the company occurs 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity are its cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances which totaled million as of december   down approximately from million as of december  the decrease is due to operating losses and capital expenditures in in conjunction with licensing magic cap technology  the company receives prepayments of royalties as it achieves certain product milestones 
the company generally accounts for prepayments of royalties as deferred revenue 
as such  future revenues recognized by the company will not generate cash to the extent of the recoupment of these deferred royalties 
such deferred royalties are generally recouped at the rate of of each dollar of royalties earned 
under the company s five original magic cap license agreements  if the royalty prepayments are not fully recouped by the fifth anniversary of the agreements november   the licensees are entitled to repayment of the unrecouped amount plus accrued interest 
in june  the company negotiated with one of its licensees to accelerate repayment of unrecouped prepaid royalties in exchange for the licensee waiving certain rights granted to it by the company in a separate agreement 
the payments are due on a quarterly basis beginning july  in equal installments of million plus accrued interest 
the final payment less any recouped advances  is due october in addition  further recoupment of royalties against prepayments is not anticipated for three of the five original magic cap licensees 
as a result  in the company reclassified  in the aggregate  approximately million from current and noncurrent deferred revenue to accrued expenses for the repayment of prepaid royalties associated with the four licensees 
less payments made in and with accrued interest  million is accrued as of december  in september  the company entered into an agreement with the fifth original magic cap licensee which  among other things  permits the licensee to recoup of any royalties owed to the company under a software modem license agreement against the magic cap royalty prepayment  amends the magic cap license agreement to provide for recoupment of any royalties due thereunder  extends the date for refund of unrecouped prepaid royalties to november   and provides that no interest shall be due upon any refund 
as a result of this new agreement  the unrecouped prepaid royalty of million remains in noncurrent deferred revenue as of december  additionally  in and  three stockholders entered into license agreements for certain magic cap technology 
these license agreements provide for the payment of a million up front  nonrefundable  nonrecoupable technology fee 
these license agreements also provide for the payment of up to million in prepaid royalties in the event the company meets certain technology milestones 
these prepayments are to be offset at a rate of for every dollar of royalties payable by the licensees upon shipments of products incorporating the company s technology 
if the company fails to deliver on the final technology milestones  the licensees may terminate the agreement and obtain a refund of only unrecouped royalties in two equal annual installments of principal  plus interest from the termination date 
during the fourth quarter of  each of the licensees demanded delivery of the final milestone due under the terms of the agreements 
in subsequent correspondence  one of the licensees further asserted that changes in the magic cap product strategy made by the company to address the internet resulted in substantial but unspecified damages  for which it seeks compensation 
on or about january   the company delivered the final product milestone  which is currently being evaluated by the licensees 
the company believes that the delivery of the final product milestone was timely and that the deliverable complies with the requirements of the agreements 
if any of the licensees ultimately rejects the final deliverable  however  the sole and exclusive remedy available under each agreement is termination of the agreement and refund of any advance royalties paid thereunder 
such a refund would be payable in two equal annual installments of principal and interest at the prime rate  with the first payment due one year following termination of the agreement 
the advance royalties paid to date by the licensees total million and are classified in noncurrent deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
there is no assurance that any of the company s licensees will continue to develop magic cap products 
therefore  it is uncertain when prepaid royalties will be recognized as revenue or if they will be fully recouped 
the company expects that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances of million as of december  will be adequate to fund the company s operations through the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the rate at which the company s magic cap licensees develop and introduce their products and services  the market acceptance and competitive position of new products and services  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch and market such products and services and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  the extent to which the company invests in new technology and management and staff infrastructure to support its business  and the response of competitors to the products and services based on the company s technologies 
to the extent that the company needs additional public and private financing  no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms favorable to the company or its stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short or long term capital requirements  the company may be required to significantly limit its operations 
as part of its business strategy  the company assesses opportunities to enter into joint ventures  to acquire businesses  products or technologies and to engage in other like transactions 
the company has made no significant commitment or agreement with respect to such transactions at this time 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business before purchasing shares of the company s stock 
change in strategy the company is developing an advanced network service for mobile business professionals and other consumers 
since commencement of operations  the company has been developing two platform technologies  magic cap and telescript  which were designed to be incorporated into products and services of the company s licensees 
as a result  a large percentage of the revenue earned by the company to date has been attributable to up front license fees and customer support fees 
in the future  the company expects to derive revenues from sales of its products and network services 
the company is at an early stage of development in its new business strategy and is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  establish technical feasibility and complete development of its software technology  enter into key partnering arrangements  respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the company s decision to focus its efforts as a provider of an advanced network service is predicated on the assumption that in the future  the number of users of the company s network service will be large enough to permit the company to operate profitably 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumption will be correct or that the company will be able to successfully compete as a network service provider 
any failure to achieve these goals could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
minimal revenues  history of and anticipation of losses the company has generated minimal revenues  has incurred significant losses and has substantial negative cash flow 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million  with net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
a large percentage of the revenue earned by the company to date is attributable to up front license fees and customer support fees  as opposed to recurring royalty revenue 
as a consequence of the company s change in strategy  the company does not currently anticipate significant revenues in see change in strategy 
in addition  under the terms of four of the company s original five magic cap license agreements  the licensees are entitled to repayment of unrecouped prepaid royalties in the company expects to continue to incur substantial losses at least through the year ending december  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain significant revenues or become cash flow positive or profitable at any time in the future 
rapid technological change the communications technology market is characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s products and services obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce new products and services including its advanced network service on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the user 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  or that its new products and services will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or consumer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
technology development the company s future success is based substantially upon its ability to develop new technology to enable it to provide an advanced network service  and to enhance its existing products and technologies 
software product development schedules are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools and the learning processes associated with development for new technologies  as well as other factors 
moreover  because of its complexity  software frequently contains undetected errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
there can be no assurance that despite testing by the company  errors will not be found in new software developed by the company 
to provide an advanced network service  the company also will require technology developed by third parties 
the company has limited control over whether or when such technologies will be developed or enhanced 
the failure to timely develop the software technology  or the occurrence of errors in such technology  could prevent or delay market acceptance of the company s advanced network service  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
distribution risks in connection with the company s change in business strategy  it must establish and maintain relationships with new distribution channels which will deliver access to the company s network service 
there is intense competition in establishing such relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in establishing such relationships  or that if established  the company will be able to maintain these relationships 
the failure of the company to successfully establish and then maintain these relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
to date  the company has distributed its magic cap and telescript platforms directly to its licensees 
only sony with its magic link product  motorola with its envoy product and matsushita with its neonet product developed commercial products based on the first generation of magic cap 
matsushita marketed the neonet only to customers of ntt s paseo service 
only at t with the at t personalink services offered a commercial on line service based on the company s first generation of telescript technology  at t terminated the personalink service in august in japan  ntt offered a telescript based english language pilot service known as paseo and fujitsu offered a telescript enabled pilot service called the imi service based on the company s first generation telescript technology 
the paseo service was terminated in january the company is currently working with certain of its licensees to deliver magic cap devices  and to develop its agent technology for internet applications 
however  there can be no assurance that these licensees will develop commercial products or services based on the company s technologies 
the company released mcw to the retail channel in october while initial channel pick up was good  the performance of the channel did not ultimately meet expectations 
the company believes it must establish distribution channels for magic cap products with independent distributors  oems  value added resellers vars and system integrators sis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish and maintain distribution channels with independent distributors  oems  vars and sis 
failure to timely establish these channels would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on emerging markets the company s future financial performance will depend on the growth in demand for an advanced network service by mobile business professionals and other consumers 
this market is new and emerging  is rapidly evolving  is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants and will be subject to frequent and continuing changes in customer preferences and technology 
as is typical in new and evolving markets  demand and market acceptance for the company s technologies are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
furthermore  the markets for pics and agent technology are not yet established 
sales of sony magic link  motorola envoy and matsushita neonet communicators were modest  and manufacture of each of these products has been discontinued 
it is not clear if  or when  the market for the pics will become substantial 
the company does not believe that its telescript derived tabriz products are likely to achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the markets for pics or for agent technology will grow to commercially significant volumes or that products or services incorporating the company s technologies will offer sufficient price and performance advantages to be commercially successful 
because the markets for the company s technologies are new and evolving  it is difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the size or growth rate  if any  of these markets 
there can be no assurance that the markets for the company s technologies will develop  or that they will not develop more slowly than expected or attract new competitors 
if the company s technologies do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
limited resources building an advanced network service based on software technology is a complex process that requires significant engineering and financial resources 
among other things  to implement its network service  the company must develop certain technology and license other technologies from third parties  and establish distribution channels and strategic partnering relationships 
in part as a result of reductions in personnel in october and january  the company currently has limited technical and sales staff 
furthermore  because the company has generated minimal revenues to date and does not expect to generate revenues from its network service in  if at all  the company must conserve its remaining cash reserves 
there can be no assurance that given the limited resources of the company it will be able to develop or implement its advanced network service 
failure to do so would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
personnel the company must continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
silicon valley remains a highly competitive job market  and there can be no assurance that key company management and engineering personnel will remain employed by the company  or that the company will be able to attract sufficient additional personnel to execute its business plan 
the company has experienced significant attrition of engineering  marketing  administrative and sales personnel in the past fifteen months  including an approximate one half reduction in its workforce between october and january these reductions have adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  development schedules and sales activities 
there can be no assurance that the company s current employees will continue to work for the company or that the company will be able to obtain the services of additional personnel necessary for the company s growth 
failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on magic cap licensees although the company views its relationship with magic cap licensees as a strategic factor in the development and commercialization of its magic cap technology  the level of commitment to the development and commercialization of the company s magic cap technology varies among these licensees 
the company provided these licensees with the next generation of its magic cap in january there can be no assurance that the company s licensees will accept the new release  or that  if they accept it  they will incorporate it into any of their products 
in addition to developing and manufacturing magic cap devices  some of the company s licensees make competitive products or have strategic relationships with competitors of the company 
failure of a significant number of magic cap licensees to successfully commercialize products utilizing the company s technologies and the failure of licensees to commit sufficient resources to the marketing of the company s technologies would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
reliance on tools development and third party applications developers the company must create new developer tools for the second generation magic cap platform  including new compilers and debuggers which will work with the second generation technology 
any delay in the availability or adoption of such tools will delay the development of applications for magic cap based communicators based on the second generation of the magic cap software  which could in turn severely limit or eliminate their chances for commercial success 
in addition  there can be no assurance that communicating applications developed by third parties will achieve market acceptance 
further  the limited success of initial products and services incorporating the company s technologies to achieve market acceptance could result in third party software developers and electronic merchants and publishers discontinuing development and support of products and services based on the company s technologies 
dependence on and responsiveness to the internet the company believes that its future success is in part dependent upon continued growth in the use of the internet 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a recent phenomenon 
the internet may prove not to be a viable means of conducting commerce or communications for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  potentially unreliable network infrastructure  or untimely development of performance improvements including high speed modems 
in addition  to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use  there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed on it by any such growth 
failure of the internet as a mode of conducting commerce and communications could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
potential security issues the implementation of a network service poses several security issues  including the possibility of break ins and other similar disruptions 
the company intends to incorporate authentication technology into its advanced network service 
however  there can be no assurance that such technology will be adequate to prevent break ins in the service 
in addition  as is generally known  weaknesses in the medium by which users may access the company s network service  including the internet  telephones  cellular phones and other wireless devices  may compromise the security of the confidential electronic information accessed from the company s network service 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide a safe and secure network service 
the company s failure to provide a secure network service may result in significant liability to the company and may deter potential users of the service 
the company intends to limit its liability to users  including liability arising from failure of the authentication technology that will be incorporated into the network service  through contractual provisions 
however  there can be no assurance that such limitations will be effective 
the company currently does not have liability insurance to protect against risks associated with forced break ins or disruptions 
there can be no assurance that security vulnerabilities and weaknesses will not be discovered in the company s network service or licensed technology incorporated into such service or in the mediums by which subscribers access the network service 
any security problems in the network service or the licensed technology incorporated in such service may require significant expenditures of capital and resources by the company to alleviate such problems  may result in lawsuits against the company  may limit the number of users of the network service and may cause interruptions or delays in the development and completion of  or the cessation of the company s network service 
any such expenditures  lawsuits  reduction of users  interruptions or delays in the development and completion of the network service  or the cessation of such service by the company  would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
critical issues concerning the security of the internet remain unresolved at this time 
if the internet proves to be unreliable with respect to the information distributed on or the transactions conducted over it  the rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet may cease  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see dependence on and responsiveness to the internet 
competition many of the companies with which the company or its licensees compete  or which are expected to offer products or services based on alternatives to the company s technologies  have substantially greater financial resources  research and development capabilities  and sales and marketing staffs and distribution channels than the company 
there can be no assurance that products incorporating the company s technologies will achieve sufficient quality  functionality or cost effectiveness to compete with existing or future alternatives 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing products or services which are more effective and lower cost than those based on the company s technologies  or which render the company s technologies obsolete 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends on factors both within and outside its control 
the principal competitive factors affecting the market for the company s services and technologies are the availability of the company s technologies and the products and services of its licensees and their competitors  the functionality and architecture of the company s technologies  the quality  ease of use  performance and functionality of the products and services developed and marketed by the company and its licensees  the effectiveness of the company and its licensees in marketing and distributing their products and services  and price 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new technologies or products introduced by existing competitors and by new companies entering the market
