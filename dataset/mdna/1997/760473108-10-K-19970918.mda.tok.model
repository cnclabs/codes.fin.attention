recycled paperboard operations compared to segment results for the company s recycled paperboard operations include both the company s recycled paperboard mills and reclaimed paper recycling operations 
shipments of recycled paperboard increased to  tons from to  a new record  due principally to a increase in shipments to unaffiliated customers 
shipments of reclaimed paper fiber also increased from year to year to  tons  also a new record  with the improvement due to a higher level of vertical integration 
net sales for the segment prior to intercompany eliminations decreased 
this was caused primarily by a decline in net selling prices of recycled paperboard and a decrease in net selling prices of reclaimed paper fiber during the year 
this decline in net selling prices of both products was partially offset by a decrease in raw material per unit costs 
raw material costs  which is primarily reclaimed paper fiber  utilized in the production of recycled paperboard declined from to per unit variable costs  other than raw materials  in the production of recycled paperboard also decreased from to the company s reclaimed paper recycling operations had a similar experience 
net selling prices eroded during the year  while the cost of baled and unbaled paper also declined but not to the full extent of net selling prices 
during fiscal  of the company s total consolidated net sales before eliminations were contributed by the recycled paperboard segment 
operating profits for the segment were  in and  in compared to shipments of recycled paperboard increased from to the increase in shipments was primarily due to the acquisition of halltown paperboard company  halltown  west virginia  on june  shipments of reclaimed paper fiber increased from to due essentially to the start up of a new production facility in denver  colorado in early fiscal net sales of the recycled paperboard segment as a whole increased from to the halltown paperboard company acquisition was  again  the primary factor influencing net sales 
during  one factor which affected adversely net sales was a reduction in net selling prices of reclaimed paper fiber sold by the company s paper recycling centers 
operating profits for the segment were  in compared to  in the contribution provided by the halltown mill as well as improved operating margins at the company s other mills were two principal factors for the improved results in additionally  the spread between net selling prices of recycled paperboard and variable per unit manufacturing costs improved significantly from to trends and developments during  variable recycled paperboard manufacturing per unit costs  a majority of which is reclaimed paper fiber  increased 
the company was able to raise its recycled paperboard selling prices during  however there was a time lag between rising material costs and subsequent selling price increases 
this time lag reduced overall margins 
during  this trend reversed and the company became the beneficiary of slowly declining selling prices and rapidly declining raw material costs 
this resulted in operating margins for the recycled paperboard segment of in fiscal compared to in during  raw material costs declined more slowly early in the year and actually began to increase again later in the year 
meanwhile  net selling prices continued to decline to make up for the more rapid decline of raw material costs in early indications are that reclaimed paper fiber costs will rise in accordingly  the company will have to increase net selling prices in to maintain or improve upon the operating margin of achieved by the recycled paperboard segment in capital expansion a five year capital expansion plan was implemented in fiscal to improve product quality and to increase the productive capacity of its hutchinson  kansas and commerce city  colorado mills by one third or approximately  tons per year 
the mills have been operating at near capacity the last two years and approximately of the goal has been realized 
the expansion will be completed as production schedules and time permit 
gypsum wallboard operations compared to the company s gypsum wallboard operations include gypsum wallboard manufacturing facilities located in duke  oklahoma as well as remote public warehouses located in birmingham  alabama and cincinnati  ohio 
additionally  the company operates a short line railroad which connects to major carriers miles from its plant  enabling the company to ship economically to distant markets 
shipments of gypsum wallboard increased from to  or from mmsf in to mmsf in  a new record for the company 
the manufacturing facility operated at near capacity during and with the increase in due essentially to incremental manufacturing improvements 
the following table denoting housing starts from to suggests a robust construction industry which significantly influences the demand for gypsum wallboard industry in millions year ended housing december starts net sales for the gypsum wallboard segment increased from fiscal to this was attributable to a increase in net selling prices and an increase in shipments of gypsum wallboard from year to year 
gypsum wallboard per unit variable manufacturing costs were essentially unchanged from to segment operating profit margins increased from in to in in  the company experienced strong demand for its gypsum wallboard products 
this precipitated rising selling prices and with stable manufacturing costs  provided excellent results for the company and the gypsum industry as a whole 
compared to gypsum wallboard shipments increased from fiscal to shipments grew from mmsf in to mmsf in the facility operated at near capacity both years 
the increase in shipments was due to an upgrade to the production process in fiscal with other adjustments in net selling prices of gypsum wallboard were virtually unchanged from to manufacturing per unit costs were higher in compared to materials  labor  and fixed manufacturing costs all increased slightly from year to year 
segment operating profit margins declined from in to in due primarily to those aforementioned cost increases 
operating profits were million in compared to million in capital expansion on february   the company announced plans to double the productive capacity of its gypsum wallboard manufacturing facilities in duke  oklahoma from the current capacity of approximately million square feet 
construction is progressing satisfactorily and is scheduled to be completed by july  expenditures are estimated to total approximately  for production equipment improvements and  for additional railcars 
the update and expansion complements the company s strategy to grow its recycled paperboard segment both by internal and external means while maintaining an adequate level of integration 
trends and developments low interest rates and a strong domestic economy caused demand for gypsum wallboard to be very strong throughout  and new construction activity has continued to be robust while repair and remodel demand for wallboard also has remained very good 
several gypsum plant expansions by other manufacturers either were completed recently or are scheduled for completion during the next two years 
in addition  the construction of four new gypsum plants by other manufacturers has been announced with completions scheduled during and the addition of a significant amount of gypsum wallboard capacity could have a materially adverse impact on gypsum selling prices 
rising interest rates and a weakening in the economy also could adversely affect wallboard demand and selling prices 
other selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were in  and in and the increase in fiscal was primarily caused by the acquisition of halltown paperboard company in june  and the start up of a reclaimed fiber production facility in denver  colorado in early fiscal interest expense totaled  in and  in the company repaid all interest bearing debt prior to june  the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal  in  and in the company believes its effective tax rate for fiscal will be in the range experienced the prior three years

due to the complexity of the environmental laws  rules and policies currently applicable to the company and the uncertainty about future changes in such laws and regulations  the company maintains accounting reserves for future unexpected expenses of the nature and magnitude incurred during the past three years 
effect of inflation management believes that general inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or operating income the last three fiscal years 
the cost of reclaimed paper fiber  which is the principle raw material component utilized in the manufacture of recycled paperboard  rose significantly during fiscal years and conversely  the cost of reclaimed fiber decreased substantially during fiscal and was relatively stable through fiscal the company believes these shifts were caused by changes in supply and demand and not general inflation or deflation

these include  but are not limited to  the following in the recent past the company and the industry as a whole have seen  due to supply and demand extremes  severe fluctuations in the cost of reclaimed paper fiber 
a rapid rise in the cost of this raw material would restrict margins at the company s recycled paperboard mills 
this is due generally to a to day time lag between increased raw material costs and subsequent selling price increases 
additionally  selling price increases may only be achievable if recycled paperboard demand allows industry operating rates to remain at or above historical levels 
the company s recycled paperboard mills and gypsum wallboard manufacturing facilities utilize large amounts of either natural gas or coal 
increases in either of these two commodities may be detrimental to sustaining the profit margins experienced in fiscal the company s manufacturing operations are located in areas of the country where natural gas and coal are plentiful 
the company believes  discounting a short term variation  that over the long term its fuel costs will at least be comparable to its competitors 
construction or expansion of new gypsum wallboard plants or recycled paper mills which compete in the company s product and market areas can be expected to have a negative impact on the company s results 
substitution of other raw materials such as plastics  aluminum or even virgin paperboard for recycled paperboard or other substitutions for gypsum wallboard could affect the company s future results 
the company believes it has sufficient reserves of gypsum ore but there are still risks associated with mining the ore such as removal costs  quality of ore  and possible future environmental regulations 
impact on the company due to industry consolidation is unknown 
the company s future results could be affected negatively by unknown consequences of present and future governmental laws and regulations  including those relating to environmental compliance 
the company s business segments could be affected by recessive and expansionary trends in the economy  as well as increases in prevailing interest rates
