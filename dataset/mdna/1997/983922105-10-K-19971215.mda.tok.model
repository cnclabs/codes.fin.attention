item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the trend analysis and other forward looking statements contained herein  as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
results of operations in thousands change change net sales    net sales versus net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to increased net sales of lan adapters  modems and multifunction lan and modem cards combo cards collectively client products  which connect portable pcs to networks  the internet and on line services such as america online 
the increase in net sales of client products was primarily due to growth in overall market demand for local and wide area network connectivity products and an increase in unit sales of the company s client products by its distribution and oem customers 
the growth in channel sell through may be indicative of several factors an increased growth rate in shipments of portable pcs  which in turn require network connections  a more competitive pricing strategy adopted by the company during fiscal  continuing increased market acceptance of the company s combo cards and fast ethernet cards  and increased sales of the company s modem only pc card products 
unit shipments of client products increased in over but average selling prices and gross profit declined due to increased competition in the pc card lan adapter market and to the continued shift in product mix to pc card versions from higher margin parallel port versions 
the increase in net sales was offset partially by a reduction in shipments by the company to its distributors during the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to reduce the levels of inventories at its distributors and enable the company to quickly react to market changes 
the company s credit card ethernet modem and creditcard ethernet adapter accounted for and  respectively  of sales and and  respectively  of sales 
international sales 
total international sales shipments to customers located outside the us increased as a percentage of total sales to in from in pc card sales in europe and asia pacific grew at a faster rate than in the us during primarily because of greater market growth in asia and shorter delays in as compared to between initial shipment of new products in the us and the shipment of internationally approved versions of such products 
net sales versus net sales increased in as compared to due primarily to growth in overall market demand for local and wide area network connectivity products and an increase in unit sales of client products by the company s distributors 
unit sales of lan adapter products increased in compared to in addition  overall average selling prices in declined from due primarily to the increased competition in the pc card lan adapter market and to the continued shift in product mix from pc card versions from higher margin parallel port versions 
in thousands change change gross profit    percentage of net sales gross profit versus gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales  which includes product costs materials  labor  manufacturing overhead and royalty payments to licensers of software incorporated into the company s products and other costs of sales  including provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty expense 
the decrease in gross profit as a percent of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to lower average selling prices on client products  the increased portion of sales represented by pc card products  which have lower gross profit margins than the company s parallel port products  the increased portion of sales made to oem customers  which generally have lower gross profit margins than sales made through the company s distribution partners  and increased inventory reserves charged to cost of sales  related primarily to excess parallel port products 
these negative gross profit impacts were partially offset by increased shipments and the resulting decrease in fixed costs as a percentage of total cost of sales  a change in the discount structure on products sold into the distribution channel beginning in the september quarter  and the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts including the successful transition of all the company s pc card production to its own manufacturing facility in penang  malaysia 
start up expenses related to the malaysian manufacturing facility had a negative impact on gross profit in the first half of fiscal gross profit versus the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to increased revenue and the resulting decrease in fixed costs as a percentage of total cost of sales  as well as the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts including the successful transition of all the company s pc card production to its own manufacturing facility in penang  malaysia 
these positive margin impacts were partially offset by the increased portion of sales represented by pc card products  which have lower gross profit margins than the company s parallel port products  and to selling price reductions on pc card products 
in addition  start up expenses related to the malaysian manufacturing facility had a negative impact on gross margins in the first half of fiscal the results also include a million inventory reserve charged to cost of sales  related primarily to excess wireless lan products 
in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales research and development expenses increased in in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales as a result of additional staffing to support expanded product offerings  offset partially by reduced spending on netwave products 
research and development expenses decreased in as compared to in absolute dollars as a result of more focused product development efforts  including reduced spending on netwave products  notwithstanding higher sales levels 
total expenditures for research and development expenses are likely to increase in as compared to in absolute dollars due to planned expenditures on product enhancements and new product introductions 
in thousands change change sales and marketing    percentage of net sales sales and marketing expenses increased in from due to additional headcount  marketing activities to support the increased sales levels and expanding markets  and increased distributor related sales and marketing expenses 
as discussed in gross profit above  the company changed its discount structure on products sold into the distribution channel beginning in the september quarter and  as a result  improved its gross profit margins in that quarter 
however  the additional gross profit dollars were applied to product and marketing programs  which increased the amount of sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in from as a result of consolidation of certain sales operations  reduced overall promotional spending due to a more focused product line  and reduced headcount through employee attrition 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal are expected to increase in absolute dollars to support planned new product introductions 
in thousands change change general and administrative    percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased in due to the need to support growth in the organization and  to a lesser extent  continued expansion of information systems hardware and software including year upgrades 
it is expected that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to support further growth within the overall organization 
during  the company performed an initial analysis of the impact of computer software issues associated with the year and initiated modification efforts 
the company does not anticipate significant future expenditures or a material disruption in operations relating to year issues 
costs of the company s year efforts are expensed as incurred

risk factors the market for portable pc lan adapters has grown rapidly since the personal computer memory card international association pcmcia introduced a standard form factor for pc card originally pcmcia lan adapters in companies with greater name recognition and market presence than xircom in the pc  desktop lan adapter and pc card modem industries and with greater financial resources now have a significant presence in the pc card adapter market 
as a result  the company s net sales and gross profit margins have been and could continue to remain subject to continued adverse competitive pressure 
continuing competitive factors include price competition  new product introductions by competitors  promotional efforts by competitors  and changes in the level of inventories in the company s distribution channels 
the company believes its share of the pc card lan adapter market stabilized in and  due primarily  the company believes  to a more competitive pricing strategy for pc card products adopted during fiscal  the success of its combination ethernet lan and modem pc card  and the introduction of several new pc card products in late and such new products include the company s fast ethernet pc card which began shipping in june  its fourth generation combo cards which began shipping in september  its cardbus ethernet adapter which began shipping in october  its fast ethernet modem combo cards which began shipping in june  and its kbps modem pc card which began shipping in july however  competition is expected to remain intense and the company could experience declines in its market share 
moreover  the company believes that the market for pc card lan adapters  modems and combo cards will continue to be price competitive for the long term and thus could continue to result in lower gross profit margins than the company has earned from such products in the past 
the company believes that its manufacturing facility is operating at a greater efficiency level than during fiscal this manufacturing facility began volume production in early fiscal and is now producing all of the company s pc card products 
while the in house manufacturing facility and increased production volumes are expected to continue to have a positive impact on cost reduction efforts  the company may not be able to achieve significant additional efficiencies from this facility 
in addition  the proportion of revenues derived from the combo and modem only pc cards which have lower gross profit margins compared to lan pc cards and the proportion of revenue derived from the oem channel which generally results in lower gross profit margins than sales made through the company s distribution partners have negatively impacted overall gross margins and may continue to offset any improvements from manufacturing and design efficiencies if such revenue mix changes continue 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to achieve cost reductions through increased manufacturing efficiencies in order to keep pace with competitors cost reductions or in an amount sufficient in the event of anticipated competitive price reductions to allow price reductions required to maintain or increase market share without adversely affecting gross profit margins 
the company generally ships products within one to four weeks after receipt of orders and therefore its sales backlog is typically minimal 
accordingly  the company s expectations of future net sales are based largely on its own estimate of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
if net sales do not meet expectations  the company may not be able to reduce expenses commensurately in the near term  and profitability would be adversely affected 
the company s net sales may be affected by its distributors decisions as to the quantity of the company s products to be maintained in their inventories 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reduced shipments to its distributors in order to reduce the levels of channel inventories and enable the company to react more quickly to the market 
at the end of september  the company believes its distributors had what the company considers to be normal levels of inventory overall 
however  there can be no assurance that distributors will not choose to reduce inventory levels nonetheless  which would adversely affect net sales 
all of the company s international sales are denominated in us dollars and may be subject to government controls and other risks  including in some cases  export licenses  federal restrictions on export  currency fluctuations  political instability  trade restrictions  and changes in tariffs and freight rates 
due to recent currency fluctuations impacting the company s asian markets  the company has taken steps to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations on its asian distributors 
the company has not experienced significant negative impacts to date as a result of these factors  however future changes in local economies or other factors could impact future operations 
there can be no assurances that new products that the company may introduce will achieve market acceptance or sell through to end users in sufficient quantities to make them viable for the long term 
in addition  the company may have difficulty in establishing its presence in markets in which it does not have significant brand recognition 
the company s modem only pc card products generally have lower gross profit margins than pc card lan adapters  however  increased sales volume from modems would have a positive impact on coverage of fixed manufacturing costs  which in time could partially offset the generally lower margins on modem products 
because all pc card products are being manufactured at the company s own facilities  interruptions in supply of products could occur if the company is unable to accurately forecast or react to changes in product demand  which in turn could adversely affect future sales 
interruptions could also occur due to political or economic changes in malaysia 
in summary  gross profit margins are impacted by a number of factors  including the rate of sales growth  competitive pricing pressures  the mix of product sales  the mix of sales made through various channels  and component and manufacturing costs 
in addition  new products often have lower margins until market acceptance and increased volumes permit component cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies 
frequent product transitions also increase the risk of inventory obsolescence and interruptions of sales 
a number of additional factors could have an impact on the company s future operating results 
the industry in which the company operates is characterized by rapid technological change and short product life cycles 
while the company has historically been successful in developing leading technology for its products  ongoing investment in research and development will be required to maintain the company s technological position and the company could be required to increase the rate of such investments depending on competitive factors 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial and technical resources than the company 
it is also possible that networking capability could be included in the pc itself or in extension modules to pcs  which could cause a reduction in the demand for add on networking devices 
the company s results are also dependent on continued growth in the underlying market for portable networking products as well as the company s ability to retain its market share 
the company is aware that competitors have duplicated certain functionality of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company s patents  copyrights  trademarks and other efforts to protect its intellectual property will prevent duplication of the company s technology or that they will provide a competitive advantage 
the company is also aware that there can be no assurance that a patent issued to the company would be upheld as valid if litigation over a patent were initiated 
the company believes that  due to the rapid pace of technological change in the lan communications industry  the company s success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service than legal protection of the company s proprietary rights 
with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology in the pc card market  there is a significant volume of patents or similar intellectual property rights held by third parties 
given the nature of the company s products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties 
these risks may include the following the cost of licensing a given technology if the company believes it may be prudent to secure such rights  the claimant may not offer such a license on terms acceptable to the company  the cost of litigation or settlement of such claims could be substantial regardless of the merits of the allegations  the company may not prevail in the event of litigation  if the company did not prevail in litigation  it could be required to pay significant damages  and or to cease sales and production of infringing products  and only make future sales of a noninfringing design 
the company currently includes software licensed from third parties in certain of its ethernet modem  modem only and token ring products  which  in the aggregate  accounted for of revenues in fiscal the company s operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to this third party software 
such factors include failure by a licensor to promote or support the software  delays in shipment of the company s products as a result of delays in the introduction of licensed software or errors in the licensed software  excess customer support costs or product returns experienced by the company due to errors in licensed software  or termination of the company s relationship with such licensors 
because of frequent technology changes and rapid industry growth  the cost and availability of components used to manufacture the company s products may fluctuate 
some components  including custom chipsets  are available from only one supplier 
any interruptions in these supply sources or limitations on availability could impact the company s ability to deliver its products and in turn adversely affect future earnings 
liquidity and capital resources the company s continuing operating activities provided cash of approximately million in  primarily as a result of a decrease in working capital requirements consisting of a decrease in accounts receivable  offset in part by increases in inventory and income tax receivable  which offset net loss from continuing operations 
investing activities in provided million in cash  primarily as a result of million in proceeds from the sale of netaccess in june the company incurred capital expenditures of million  primarily related to equipment for increased headcount  manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements at the malaysian manufacturing facility  and information systems hardware and software 
the company has no material fixed commitments for capital expenditures  however the company has made the decision to purchase for cash the malaysian manufacturing facility which it currently leases 
the purchase of the facility would require a capital expenditure of approximately million 
the company s financing activities provided million in cash in on february   the company sold to intel corporation  newly issued shares of the company s common stock representing a percent interest at the date of issuance and a warrant to purchase an additional  newly issued shares of the company s common stock 
in consideration  the company received net cash proceeds of million 
the warrant is exercisable at a price of per share through february   per share from february  through february   and per share from february  through its expiration on february  the company intends to use the proceeds from the equity investment for working capital purposes 
the company has a two year credit facility with a bank for borrowings up to million 
loans under the agreement are advanced based on the company s accounts receivable and inventories  subject to borrowing formulas and are secured by all us based assets of the company 
as of september   there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
the agreement expires in december the company also has a credit facility  denominated in malaysian ringgit  with a bank in malaysia totaling million 
million was outstanding under this agreement as of september  all amounts under this facility were repaid by the company in november the company had approximately million in borrowings available under its credit facilities as of september  the company believes that cash on hand  borrowings available under its existing facilities or from other financing sources and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that future cash requirements to fund operations will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner than the twelve months  or that such additional capital will be available when required on terms acceptable to the company
