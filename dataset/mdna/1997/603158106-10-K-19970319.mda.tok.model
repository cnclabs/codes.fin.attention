item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing  distribution and administrative expenses research and development expenses income from operations net income overview of and outlook in  the company adhered to its strategy of expanding its precipitated calcium carbonate pcc product line 
the company commenced operations at six new satellite pcc plants 
three of these satellite pcc plants are in brazil  one in thailand  one in israel and another in the united states 
together  these plants have production capacity equivalent to approximately twelve satellite units 
a satellite unit is equivalent to annual production capacity of between  and  tons of pcc 
the company also expanded production capacity at several satellite pcc plants at various locations around the world in as a result  sales of pcc as a percentage of the company s total net sales  which were in  had risen to by the company expects this trend to continue as volume growth of pcc sales continues to outpace growth in the processed minerals  formerly named other minerals  and refractory product lines 
presently  the company is operating satellite pcc plants  including in north america 
the company expects volume growth to continue in as three new satellite pcc plants are now under construction 
these satellite pcc plants are located in slovakia  indonesia and the united states and have combined production capacity equivalent to approximately five satellite units 
the company expects additional expansions at existing satellite pcc plants to occur in and also expects to sign contracts for additional satellite pcc plants in the united states and abroad 
in  the company expects to continue its focus on the following growth strategies for the pcc product line continued efforts to increase market penetration in north america  europe  latin america  the pacific rim and elsewhere 
continued expansions of the capacity of existing plants in response to increased demand  resulting from increased pcc filler levels in paper 
continued research and development and marketing efforts of acid tolerant pcc  coating pcc and other products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term agreements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
to date  the company s experience with extensions and renewals of its satellite pcc agreements has been favorable 
there is no assurance  however  that these contracts will be renewed prior to their respective expiration dates 
the company will continue to emphasize specialty products  such as the kilnteq r system  in its refractory product line and commercialize products  processes and equipment through research and development efforts 
as the company expands its operations overseas  it faces the increased risks of doing business abroad  including exchange rate fluctuations  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds and other factors 
in addition  the company s performance depends to some extent on that of the industries it serves  particularly the paper  steel and construction industries 
during  the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation of the people s republic of china instituted a system under which chinese exporters must purchase  through competitive bidding  licenses to export specified commodities  including magnesia  the principal raw material used in the company s refractory products 
the exporters holding such licenses generally attempted to pass the cost of the license fee on to their customers 
this license fee was increased significantly as of january  resulting in increased worldwide prices for chinese magnesia 
the company had initiated price increases in refractory products and had located lower cost alternative sources of supply of magnesia 
however  the price increases were not sufficient to fully offset the higher cost of magnesia  and thus far alternative sources of supply of magnesia have been limited 
during the second half of  worldwide prices of chinese magnesia have decreased from peak prices and appear to have stabilized 
results of operations net sales in millions growth growth net sales worldwide net sales in increased over the previous year to million 
higher volumes in the pcc and processed minerals product lines were the primary contributors to the sales growth 
the stronger us dollar had an unfavorable impact of approximately million on sales growth 
in  worldwide net sales increased over the prior year to million 
this increase was primarily attributed to growth in the pcc and refractory product lines 
worldwide net sales of pcc in increased to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributed to the startup of six new satellite pcc plants  significant growth from one satellite plant that began operations in the third quarter of and expansion of production capacity at several locations 
pcc sales in increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributed to the start of operations at two new satellite plants during and several expansions of production capacity at existing satellite pcc plants 
net sales of processed minerals increased to million in the sales growth was primarily attributable to higher volumes 
in  processed mineral products net sales rose slightly to million 
sales growth was tempered by a slowdown in the automotive and construction industries in net sales of refractory products decreased to million from million in however  profitability increased significantly due to continued emphasis on higher margin specialty products 
the decrease in refractory products sales was primarily attributable to volume declines and unfavorable foreign exchange rates 
in addition  in  the company brought forward the financial close of certain international subsidiaries to a current calendar month 
this resulted in an unfavorable impact on the sales growth

marketing  distribution and administrative costs increased to million and were of sales  a slight reduction from the ratio 
in  marketing  distribution and administrative costs increased to million and were of sales 
research and development expenses during were million representing of sales  a slight reduction from the ratio 
this reduction reflects a more efficient use of resources due to the increasing worldwide infrastructure which allows the company to support trials and new plants at a lower cost while continuing its commitment to research  particularly in the pcc product line 
in  research and development spending increased to million 
income from operations in millions growth growth income from operations income from operations in increased to million from million in strong operating earnings growth was achieved through higher sales volumes in the pcc product line  improved profitability in the refractory product lines and an overall containment of costs and expenses 
operating profits were impacted negatively by the higher cost of magnesia and significant startup costs associated with the six new satellite pcc plants 
in  income from operations rose to million from million 
this growth was achieved through higher sales volume in the pcc and refractory product lines 
non operating deductions in millions growth growth non operating deductions  net interest expense increased in primarily as a result of higher interest costs associated with additional borrowings 
interest income and other income were significantly higher in the prior year due to higher levels of cash on hand and a non recurring foreign exchange gain  respectively 
in  non operating deductions decreased as a result of foreign exchange gains and higher capitalized interest costs associated with the significant growth in capital spending

the interest rates on these borrowings were and  respectively at december  and the company anticipates that capital expenditures for will be approximately million  principally related to the construction of satellite pcc plants and expansion projects at existing satellite pcc plants and other opportunities which meet the strategic growth objectives of the company 
the company expects to meet its long term capital requirements from internally generated funds  the aforementioned uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse impact on the company 
the contracts pursuant to which the company constructs and operates its satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation
