none of the non cash charges are due to contractions in the core businesses of the company  and therefore are not expected to effect future liquidity or results of operations 
charges for the management reorganization and potential liabilities related to settlement of litigation will generally be paid over an extended period of time in excess of one year 
the management reorganization and lay offs of other employees were not due to a contraction in the company s core businesses  but rather are cost cutting measures being implemented to improve operations 
these liabilities  depending on the extent and timing  could effect future liquidity  but are expected to be funded from on going operations

there can be no assurance that the company s currently available resources will be sufficient to allow the company to support its operations until such time  if any  as its internally generated cash flow is able to sustain the company 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern 
as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net working capital deficiency of  as of december  additionally  the company has utilized significant cash flows from operating activities of  these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
management has implemented an organizational and strategic restructuring aimed at reducing overhead expenses by and focusing on the company s business units 
this involved a workforce reduction including five senior officers  the buyout of many high rate lease obligations  and restructuring its management personnel and responsibilities 
management believes that these factors will contribute toward achieving profitability and improving cash flow 
in the past  the company has been able to fund its operations and improve its working capital position by sales of common stock  upon exercise of warrants and options  by leasing transactions for equipment in use at subscriber locations  and by licensing its technology to foreign licensees 
the company is exploring alternative capital financing possibilities which may include i licensing and related royalties of the company s technology and products  ii borrowing arrangements under fixed and revolving credit agreements  or iii sale of additional equity securities 
the company may negotiate for additional lease and debt financing and additional foreign licensing  however  the extent to which any of the foregoing may be accomplished  if at all  cannot be predicted at this time 
the company has certain lawsuits pending as previously described in legal proceedings 
the company believes  based in part on the advice of outside  independent counsel  that there is no basis to claimants allegations  but to avoid the expense and disruption of protracted litigation has settled certain cases and may continue to attempt to settle others 
the company provided a charge against its current earnings for such possible actions  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in settling or defending such actions or that any or all actions would be decided in favor of the company or that the continued cost of defending and prosecuting these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

throughout the company s history  the principal component of its revenues has been derived from network services to locations in the hospitality industry restaurants  taverns and hotels 
management believes that this component will continue to grow in total revenues within the next year  but may decline as a percentage of the company s total revenues 
to increase the number of locations  the company has taken several steps 
it reorganized its sales staff to accommodate the growth in and the anticipated growth in the company offers sales and technical support to its independent distributors  who are responsible for marketing the company s services to potential locations 
in  the company will continue to attend national and regional hospitality industry trade shows and has maintained its budget for advertising in trade publications 
a major source of growth in was from online internet services revenue 
the company will continue to provide additional programs to current customers in an effort to increase consumer revenue hours 
in addition  the company will continue to seek new outlets for its programs and also provide production services for a fee 
in  the company enhanced its graphics capabilities and obtained additional advertising revenues from national advertisers 
the company has a full time advertising sales staff and is currently negotiating with several potential advertisers for commercial spots on the ntn network as well for the company s online internet programs 
management believes that another market segment with potential for long term growth is the market for interactive television services in the home 
the company expects to remain a provider of specialized programming to networks operated by other organizations  such as cable networks  computer on line systems and wireless or telephone based communication networks 
the company expects to deliver the video portion of its programming directly to cable television systems  with viewer responses processed using equipment developed by others 
in light of this  the company expects that any significant revenues from home use of the company s services will be dependent upon an expansion in the overall home viewer market for home interactive information and entertainment services 
the company maintains excellent working relationships with major providers of home interactive information and entertainment services 
as the market for home interactive information and entertainment services expands  the company will seek to capitalize on this market 
revenues to date from in home programming have not been significant 
no assurance can be given that plans to expand into the interactive television market will be successful 
the company has plans to expand its penetration in the education sector as well 
currently  the learnstar system is operational at over schools throughout the nation 
in  the company will focus efforts to expand into additional schools in many states 
revenues from these sources have not been significant in the past and no assurance can be given that plans to expand the education market will be successful 
although there can be no assurance that the company will prove to be successful in implementing its marketing and expansion plan  management believes that the company s prospects have been materially improved by the growth of its core business activities and increased customer awareness
