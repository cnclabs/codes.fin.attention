during  the company used approximately  in cash to acquire property and equipment and approximately  in cash to reduce short and long term debt 
during the third quarter of  the company agreed to acquire testing analysis equipment at a cost of approximately  physical delivery and financing was completed in december and in the first quarter of in february  pharmchem amended its revolver and term loan credit agreement credit agreement with a bank with respect to certain financial covenants 
in march  the company amended the credit agreement to provide for additional credit availability  an extended revolver loan maturity date and greater covenant flexibility 
the revolver was increased from  to  of which  was outstanding at the end of the credit agreement provides for borrowings under the revolver limited to of qualified account receivables 
the revolver maturity date was extended from may until november the revolver bears interest at the bank reference rate plus at december  
as of december   approximately  was outstanding under the term loan  which expires in november the term loan bears interest at the bank reference rate plus at december  
all borrowings are secured by a lien on all assets of the company 
the company anticipates that existing cash balances  amounts available under the credit agreement and funds to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations and budgeted capital expenditures through factors affecting operating results pharmchem is subject to a number of risks which could affect operating results and liquidity  which risks include  among others  the following competition and customer contracts 
the drug testing industry in which pharmchem competes is often characterized by competitive bidding which results in the award of contracts based on technical superiority  customer service and price 
the company competes for customer contracts against firms that may have greater financial  marketing  laboratory and related resources 
the market for drug testing services became increasingly competitive in the s  and continues to be competitive 
a majority of the company s sales arise out of competitively bid contracts 
the company has in the past failed to renew significant contracts  including the loss of the contract with the us army which represented and of the company s total sales in and  respectively 
while many of the company s contracts have multi year terms  most contracts are subject to discretionary termination on short notice by the company s customers 
in addition  relatively few of the company s contracts call for minimum contract amounts or payments 
although the company s historical experience has been that customers generally use its services for the entire length of the contract term  early termination of a substantial contract  if not replaced by comparable contracts  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
pharmchek tm 
since  the company has been investing in pharmchek tm  a system which uses sweat to detect the use of illegal drugs 
the process of bringing pharmchek tm to market has been subject to technical and regulatory delays and there is no assurance that there will not be similar delays in the future 
additional testing of pharmchek tm by customers is required before commercial release can occur 
to date  sales of pharmchek tm have not been material and there is no assurance that it will be commercially accepted by existing or new customers or generate significant revenues in the future 
while the company that developed pharmchek tm has obtained patents relating to its technology  there is no assurance as to the validity of such patents  that the products marketed by the company will be covered by such patents  or that competitors will not infringe upon such patents or successfully design similar or competing products that do not infringe upon such patents 
the company has incurred significant costs in connection with the commercialization of pharmchek tm and expects to continue to do so in the future 
the company s investment in pharmchek tm marketing rights was approximately   and  during  and  respectively 
customer concentration 
the company s two largest customers accounted for approximately a combined and of the company s sales in and  respectively 
the loss of these contracts  if not replaced by comparable contracts  would result in lower sales  lower profit margins  and in negative cash flows and losses 
the company has in the past failed to renew significant contracts which have had adverse effects on the company 
see competition and customer contracts above 
certification 
the company s laboratory is currently certified by samhsa  clia  cap and a number of states to conduct drug testing using forensic procedures 
certification is essential to the company s business because some of its customers are required to use certified laboratories  and many of its customers look to certification as an indication of accuracy and reliability of results 
in order to remain certified  the company is subject to frequent inspections and proficiency tests 
failure to meet any of the numerous certification requirements to which the company is subject could result in suspension or loss of certification 
such suspension or loss of certification could have a material adverse effect on the company 
fluctuations in operating results 
along with competition and customer contracts  pharmchem s operations are affected by seasonal trends to which drug testing laboratories are generally subject 
in the past  testing volume tends to be higher in the second and third calendar quarters and lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters  primarily due to the hiring patterns of the company s public and private employer customer group which affect pre employment drug testing 
further  demand for the company s services is dependent on general economic conditions 
recessionary periods generally result in fewer new hires  and therefore may lead to fewer pre employment drug tests for public and private employer customers 
budget cuts at the federal  state  or local level could reduce business from the company s public employer  criminal justice agency and government funded drug treatment program customers 
because expenses associated with maintaining the company s testing work force are relatively fixed over the short term  the company s profit margins tend to increase in periods of higher testing volume and decrease in periods of lower testing volume 
judicial decisions and government policy 
state and federal courts have generally permitted the use of drug testing under certain circumstances and using certain procedures 
however  challenges to drug testing programs are raised from time to time by employees  unions and other groups in litigation on constitutional  privacy and other grounds 
in addition  legal precedent in a number of states governs the circumstances under which employers may test employees and the procedures under which such tests must be conducted 
although the company believes that  to date  no such litigation or law has had a material adverse impact upon its business  new decisions  legislation or policies which restrict the use of drug testing could have a material adverse effect on the company 
credit availability 
pharmchem maintains a term and revolver loan credit agreement with a bank 
all borrowings are secured by a lien on all assets of the company 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  with which it anticipates that it will be able to comply throughout  although there can be no assurance that such compliance will be maintained 
management expects to enter into a new credit agreement with comparable terms prior to the expiration date of the existing credit agreement 
legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of its business  pharmchem is sued by individuals  primarily those in the criminal justice system  who have tested positive for drugs of abuse 
in addition  the company frequently testifies in administrative and court proceedings involving the results of its tests 
to date  the company has not experienced any material liability related to these claims  although there can be no assurance that the company will not at some time in the future experience significant liability in connection with such claims 
there are no pending legal proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the company s business  to which pharmchem is a party or to which any of its property is subject and management does not believe the outcome of any of the proceedings will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
the company believes that its liability insurance coverage is adequate for its business 
environmental matters 
a small portion of the company s business involves testing procedures requiring the use of chloroform and radioactive reagents  which are considered to be hazardous materials 
failure to comply with current or future federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations regarding these hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
dependence on key personnel 
the success of pharmchem is dependent in part on its key management and technical personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on the company 
none of the company s key employees has an employment contract with the company 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part upon its continued ability to attract  retain and motivate additional highly skilled personnel
