item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
results of operations compared to net income for increased to million compared to million in this improvement is attributable to a increase in earned premiums  a increase in net investment income  an improved expense ratio and a continuing low loss ratio 
net income per share on a fully diluted basis increased to for compared to per share in operating earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were for compared to per share in operating earnings exclude realized investment losses of approximately  in and realized investment gains of approximately  in new insurance written was billion in compared to billion in  an increase of 
new insurance written was million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the same period of the increase in new insurance written in is the result of the continued penetration of triad s products in the marketplace coupled with a favorable interest rate environment for much of  which caused both refinance and home buying activities to remain strong for the year 
refinance activity accounted for of new insurance written in compared to for according to industry data  triad s share of total new mortgage insurance written increased to in the fourth quarter for compared to for all of this increase is primarily the result of the company s geographic expansion into new territories and the success of a marketing focus on larger  national mortgage lenders 
total direct premiums written were million for  an increase of compared to million in contributing to this growth were the strong mortgage market  the company s continued expansion into new territories  the secondary mortgage market requirements for deeper coverages and increased renewal premium due to the growth of our monthly premium product 
offsetting the growth somewhat was the decrease in triad s persistency rate  reflecting the increase in refinancing activity 
persistency  or the percentage of insurance remaining in force from one year prior  was in compared to in sales under the company s monthly premium plan represented approximately of new insurance written in compared to in the monthly product spreads the collection of premiums over equal monthly payments  rather than one payment received in advance as on annual premium plans 
however  renewal premiums on monthly premium plans are greater than the renewal premiums item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued on a comparable annual premium plan 
while in the short term monthly premium plans decrease the level of written premium  management expects the ultimate level of written premium on monthly premium plans to exceed the level of written premium produced by comparable annual premium plans as long as persistency remains strong 
in  triad introduced a variation of the monthly premium plan in which the borrower does not pay any mortgage insurance premium at the time of the mortgage loan closing 
this deferred monthly premium product decreases the amount of cash required from the borrower at closing  therefore  making home ownership more affordable 
management believes that the percentage of new insurance written under monthly premium plans will remain at or slightly above the current level 
net premiums written increased by to million for compared to million for earned premiums increased to million in this increase in written and earned premium is attributable to the increase in new insurance written  continued strong persistency and a change in the company s reinsurance program for effective january   the company eliminated its quota share reinsurance on new business  recaptured substantial portions of its quota share coverage on renewal business and secured excess of loss reinsurance to protect against catastrophic losses 
these changes reduced the company s quota share cede rate to of direct premium written in compared to in premiums ceded under the company s quota share reinsurance agreements for totaled million compared to million in had the company retained its quota share reinsurance in and maintained a cede rate comparable to  the company s net written premium would have increased approximately rather than the noted above 
total direct insurance in force reached billion at december  compared to billion the previous year  an increase of 
in keeping with the company s established risk strategy  the company has not aggressively solicited mortgage insurance under lender guidelines which allow relaxed credit standards  reduced borrower paid down payment eg ltv loans and expanded underwriting ratios 
these products  especially popular with borrowers with weak credit histories  have generally resulted in undesirable loss ratios 
management believes that successful long term home ownership is not necessarily being promoted by many of these programs 
the company does not routinely delegate the underwriting of its ltv product 
the company s delegated underwriting program accounted for in the fourth quarter of commitments received in compared to in the fourth quarter in this program has allowed the company to serve a greater number of the larger  well established mortgage originators 
mortgage originators who participate in the company s delegated program are allowed to issue a certificate of insurance on the loans they underwrite but must follow item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued strict criteria regarding property type and minimum credit standards 
the company also performs extensive post issuance quality control reviews of certificates issued through each approved mortgage originator under the program 
in the fourth quarter of  triad introduced a new product in which a certificate of insurance is issued based on a borrower s credit score 
under this new product  if a borrower has a predetermined minimum credit score  triad will issue a certificate of insurance without the usual underwriting process 
management expects the percentage of commitments processed through the company s delegated underwriting program to decrease slightly in as a result of this new product 
net investment income for was million  a increase over million in this increase resulted from the growth in average invested assets of million to million at december  the yield on average invested assets was for both and the portfolio s tax equivalent yield was in and in this yield reflects the company s investment strategy to emphasize tax preferred securities which yield lower pre tax rates than similar fully taxable securities 
approximately or million of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  was comprised of state and municipal tax preferred securities 
in  the company reported realized investment losses of  resulting primarily from closing transactions in connection with the company s program of selling short term covered calls 
this compares to  of investment gains in realized primarily from the sale of equity securities 
the company s loss ratio the ratio of incurred losses to earned premiums was for compared to for the loss ratio was for the fourth quarter compared to for the same period of the favorable loss ratio reflects the low level of delinquencies compared to the number of insured loans and the fact that of the insurance in force was originated in the last months 
management believes  based upon its experience and industry data  that claims incidence for it and other private mortgage insurers is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination 
although the claims experience on new insurance written in previous years has been quite favorable  the company expects its incurred losses to increase as a greater amount of its insurance in force reaches its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
due to the inherent uncertainty of future premium levels  losses  economic conditions and other factors that impact earnings  it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty the impact of such higher claims frequencies on future earnings 
during periods of significant refinancing activity  it is possible that policies on stronger loans may lapse and that weaker loans may remain in force  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued thus potentially increasing the loss ratio on older business 
substantial increases in production of new business during these periods can offset the increased loss ratio on the older business 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoveries increased by in to million compared to million in  reflecting the increase in the company s insurance in force and the resulting recognition of a greater amount of insurance in force reaching its higher claim frequency years 
a decrease in reinsurance recoveries  attributable to the company s restructuring of its reinsurance program for  also contributed to the increase in net losses and loss adjustment expenses 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by to million in compared to million for the increase in amortization reflects a growing balance of deferred policy acquisition costs to amortize as the company builds its total insurance in force 
other operating expenses increased to million for compared to million for this increase in expenses is primarily attributable to personnel  facilities and equipment costs required to support triad s geographic expansion and increased production coupled with a reduction in ceding commissions earned following changes in the company s reinsurance program 
ceding commissions paid to the company are reported as a reduction in other operating expenses and decreased to  in compared to million in the company s expense ratio ratio of underwriting expenses to net premiums written for was compared to for contributing to this improvement was the higher level of written premiums for offset somewhat by the increase in expenses 
the effective tax rate for all of was compared to for in  the company began a phase in of the federal statutory income tax rate applicable to companies with annual taxable income above million 
management expects the company s effective tax rate to remain about the same or increase slightly as long as yields from new funds invested in tax preferred securities remain favorable in relation to fully taxable securities 
compared to net income for increased to million compared to million in this improvement was attributable to a increase in earned premiums  a increase in net investment income  a continuing low loss ratio and  in realized investment gains  offset by a slightly higher expense ratio in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued net income per share on a fully diluted basis was for  compared to per share in the company s operating earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were for and for operating earnings per share exclude realized investment gains of approximately  in and realized investment losses of  in new insurance written was million for both and new insurance written in was driven by new home sales as refinance activity declined 
refinance activity accounted for of new insurance written in compared to in total direct premiums written were million for  an increase of over contributing to this growth were the strong mortgage market  the company s expansion into new territories  the movement by consumers to higher premium products in early  the secondary mortgage market requirements for deeper coverages and triad s continued high persistency rate 
persistency improved to in compared to in improved persistency combined with higher production in recent years contributed to the increase in renewal premiums in the rising interest rates experienced in the first half of resulted in increased sales of higher premium products  such as coverages for adjustable rate mortgages  higher loan to value mortgages and longer term mortgages 
the result was a greater level of written premium for the amount of new insurance written  partially offset by the effects of increasing production of monthly premium plans 
sales under the company s monthly premium plan represented of new insurance written in compared to in premiums ceded under the company s quota share reinsurance agreements for totaled million  representing a slight decrease from million in the ratio of premiums ceded to total direct written premiums decreased to in compared to in the company ceded only of new insurance written in compared to of new insurance written 
net premiums written increased by to million for compared to million for continued improvement in persistency  the company s continued geographic expansion and a reduction in the reinsurance cede rate all contributed to this growth  which was offset somewhat by the increase in production of the company s monthly premium plan 
earned premiums increased to million in total direct insurance in force reached billion at december  compared to billion the previous year  an increase of 
net investment income for was million  a increase over million in this increase resulted from average invested assets increasing by million to million at december  the yield on average invested assets increased to for compared to for reflecting the company s investments in higher yielding intermediate term investments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued in  the company reported realized investment gains of  primarily from the sale of equity securities 
this compares to  of realized investment losses in resulting primarily from the sale of approximately million in lower yielding short term us treasury securities 
the company s loss ratio was for compared to for while the company experienced an increase in its loss ratio  paid losses continue to remain low at and for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the favorable loss ratio reflects the low level of delinquencies compared to the number of insured loans and the fact that of the insurance in force was originated in  and net losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoveries increased by in to million compared to million in this increase in reflects the increase in the company s insurance in force and the resulting recognition of a greater amount of insurance in force reaching its higher claim frequency years 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by to million in compared to million for the increase in amortization reflects a growing balance of deferred policy acquisition costs to amortize as the company builds its total insurance in force 
other operating expenses  before deducting ceding commissions of approximately million for both and  increased to million for compared to million for this increase in expenses was primarily attributable to costs incurred in expanding into new territories  an increase in the number of sales and support personnel  and growth in renewal commissions not deferred 
the expense ratio for was compared to for factors contributing to this increase include the growth in costs associated with the company s expansion into new territories  an increase in personnel and the effects of the monthly premium product in the effective tax rate for was compared to in this decrease reflected an increasing investment in tax preferred securities 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of operating funds consist primarily of premiums written and investment income 
operating funds are applied primarily to the payment of claims and expenses 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued the company generated positive cash flow from operating activities for and of and million  respectively 
the significant increase in the company s operating cash flow is attributable to growth in insurance written and the restructuring of its reinsurance agreements effective january  the company s business does not routinely require significant capital expenditures 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and expenses 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
the parent company s cash flow is dependent on cash dividends and revenues from management fees from triad 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois impose certain restrictions on dividends from triad 
these restrictions  based on statutory accounting practices  include requirements that dividends may be paid only out of statutory earned surplus and limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the illinois insurance department 
because of triad s rapid growth in written premiums and the requirement to add amounts to the statutory contingency reserve equal to at least of earned premiums which reduces statutory earned surplus  triad reported a deficit in statutory earned surplus of and million at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  triad may not presently pay cash dividends to the parent company 
the illinois insurance department permits expenses of the parent company to be charged to triad in the form of management fees 
consolidated invested assets were million at december   including a total of million in fixed maturity securities and equity securities classified as available for sale 
net unrealized investment gains totaled million at december   million on both fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
approximately or million of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  was composed of mortgage backed securities  substantially all of which are guaranteed by us government agencies 
certain mortgage backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates 
as a result  holders of mortgage backed securities may receive large prepayments on their investments which must be reinvested at then current rates 
included in the company s fixed maturity portfolio of mortgage backed securities at december  was million invested in planned amortization class pac collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
pacs are tranches of cmos specifically designed to amortize in a more predictable manner and to protect against prepayments as interest rates decline 
in periods item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued of declining interest rates  prepayments are first applied to the non pac tranches of the cmo  creating improved call protection for the pac tranche 
only after all non pac tranches have been paid off are prepayments applied to the pac tranche 
in periods of increasing interest rates  prepayments are first applied to the pac tranche  thus reducing extension risk for pacs 
as a result  pacs have a more stable cash flow than most other mortgage securities because they have better call protection and less extension risk 
all principal balances invested in cmos by the company are us government agency sponsored or guaranteed 
the company s loss reserves increased to million at december  compared to million at december  this growth is the result of increases in new insurance written and the maturing of the company s risk in force 
consistent with industry practices  the company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans which are not currently in default 
the company s reserves per delinquent loan were  at december  compared to  at december  the company s delinquency ratio  the ratio of delinquent insured loans to total insured loans  was at december  compared to at december  the company s unearned premium reserve of million at december  decreased from million at december  this decline is attributable to the increased production of the monthly premium product which produces little unearned premium compared to annual and single premium products 
also  the company experienced a higher level of refinance activity in whereby older annual premium policies were replaced by monthly premium policies resulting in a decline in the unearned premium reserve 
total stockholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase resulted from net income of million and from additional paid in capital of  resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on invested assets classified as available for sale of  net of income tax 
triad s total statutory policyholders surplus increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of million 
this increase is primarily derived from statutory net income of million and unrealized gains on invested assets of million  offset by an increase in the contingency reserve of million 
triad s deficit in statutory earned surplus was million at december   compared to a deficit of million at december   reflecting a growth in statutory net income greater than the increase in the contingency reserve 
the balance in the contingency reserve was million at december  compared to million at december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued the company currently has no plans for significant capital expenditures 
however  triad continues to upgrade and enhance its computer systems and technological capabilities 
as part of the company s efforts to increase its focus on larger national lenders  triad is currently developing a mortgage insurance program that would enable the company to better meet the needs and requirements of the larger national lenders 
the program  which will be marketed beginning in the first quarter of  increases the lender s share of the risk of loss on an insured book of business and provides for a fee to the lender for this increased risk 
while the impact of this product to triad cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that successful marketing and acceptance of this product by national lenders could provide significant growth opportunities for triad in loans insured under this program must meet triad s underwriting and credit standards 
the company s ability to write insurance depends on the adequacy of its capital in relation to risk in force 
a significant reduction of capital or a significant increase in risk may impair the company s ability to write additional insurance 
freddie mac and fannie mae require the company to maintain a risk to capital ratio of no more than to a number of states also generally limit the company s risk to capital ratio to to as of december  triad s risk to capital ratio was to  and as of december  was to  as compared to to for the industry as a whole at december   the latest industry data available 
the increase is due to increased production and the elimination of substantial portions of the company s quota share reinsurance as of january  management believes its risk to capital ratio can increase up to the current industry level without an adverse effect on its claims paying ability ratings 
in january  standard poor s corporation s p raised triad s claims paying ability rating to aa from aa

the statement encourages but does not require the recognition of compensation expense for stock based awards based on the award s fair value
