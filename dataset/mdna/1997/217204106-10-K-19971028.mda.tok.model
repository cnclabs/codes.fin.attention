item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company processes salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method  on either the percentage incentive program or the pip or on a fixed fee consignment basis 
using either consignment method  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue 
the company also processes a percentage of its salvage vehicles pursuant to purchase contracts the purchase program under which the company records the gross proceeds of the vehicle sale in revenue 
for the fiscal years ended july    and  approximately   and of the vehicles sold by copart  respectively  were processed under the pip  and approximately  and of the vehicles sold by copart  respectively  were processed pursuant to the purchase program 
the increase in the percentage of vehicles sold under the pip in fiscal is due to the company s successful marketing efforts 
the decrease in the percentage of vehicles sold under the pip in fiscal resulted from the acquisition by copart of various companies that conducted business on a fixed fee consignment basis  which is consistent with industry practice 
as a result of the acquisition of ner auction group ner on may   which processed almost all of its vehicles on a fixed fee consignment basis  the percentage of the company s vehicles processed under the pip decreased 
the company attempts to convert acquired operations to the pip program which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to the company than standard fixed fee consignment programs 
the decrease in vehicles sold under the purchase program between fiscal and is attributable to the termination  or renegotiation to consignment contracts  of certain vehicle purchase contracts 
however  due to a number of factors  including the timing and size of new acquisitions  market conditions  and acceptance of the pip program by vehicle suppliers  the percentage of vehicles processed under this program in future periods may vary 
in addition to auction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers  approximately   and of copart s revenues for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively  were attributable to buyer fees  which are fees received from buyers in addition to amounts they pay to purchase salvage vehicles 
costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fleet maintenance and repair  fuel and acquisition costs of salvage vehicles under the purchase program 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  accounting  data processing and sales personnel  professional fees and marketing expenses 
the period to period comparability of copart s operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions and new openings made by copart during such periods 
acquisitions and new operations copart has experienced significant growth as it acquired salvage vehicle auction facilities and established eight new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of the acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method 
accordingly  the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible assets acquired consisting principally of goodwill is being amortized over periods not exceeding years 
as part of the company s overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers  the company anticipates further attempts to open or acquire new salvage yards in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by company yards 
as part of this strategy  during fiscal  copart acquired facilities near baton rouge  louisiana  and salt lake city  utah and opened new facilities in woodinville  washington and hammond  indiana 
in fiscal  copart acquired two facilities in or near jackson  mississippi and el paso  texas and opened five new facilities in or near charlotte  north carolina  jacksonville  florida  indianapolis  indiana  van nuys  california  and phoenix  arizona 
during fiscal  copart acquired ner  plus six facilities in or near kansas city  kansas  tulsa and oklahoma city  oklahoma  st 
louis  missouri  and conway and west memphis  arkansas  and opened one facility in sacramento  california 
the company believes that these acquisitions and openings solidify the company s coverage of the west coast  expand the company s coverage of the south  southwest and midwest  give the company a substantial presence in the northeast  the great lakes states  georgia and florida 
the company expects to incur future amortization charges in connection with anticipated acquisitions attributable to goodwill  covenants not to compete and other purchase related adjustments 
the company seeks to increase revenues and profitability at acquired facilities by  among other things  i implementing its buyer fee structure  ii introducing and converting certain vehicle suppliers to the pip  which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to the company than standard fixed fee consignment programs  iii making available vehicle purchase programs which are designed to reduce vehicle suppliers administrative expenses and iv initiating the company s merchandising procedures 
in addition  the company attempts to effect cost efficiencies at each of its acquired facilities through  among other things  implementing the company s operational procedures  integrating the company s management information systems and  when necessary  redeploying personnel

at july   copart had working capital of approximately million  including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
the company is able to process  market  sell and receive payment for processed vehicles quickly 
therefore  the company does not require substantial amounts of working capital  as it receives payment for vehicles at approximately the same time as it remits payments to vehicle suppliers 
the company s primary source of cash is from the collection of sellers fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles and from buyers fees

during the fiscal year ended july   copart used cash for the acquisition of the jackson  mississippi and el paso  texas facilities  which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately million
