as of december   the company had gains on sales totaling approximately  which have been deferred for federal and state income tax purposes since the company s organization in impact of inflation over of the company s total revenues for were derived from apartment properties 
due to the short term nature of most apartment leases typically one year or less  the company may seek to adjust rents to help counter the impact of inflation upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adjust rents in response to inflation 
in addition  occupancy rates may also fluctuate due to short term leases which permit apartment residents to leave at the end of each lease term at minimal cost to the resident
