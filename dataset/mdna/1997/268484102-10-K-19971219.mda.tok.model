item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
general during the past two fiscal years  the company s revenues increased at a compound annual rate of to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september   and its operating income increased at a compound annual rate of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s recent growth has been generated almost exclusively by increasing the number of terminals operated by the company and growth in revenue produced by existing terminals 
since october   it has added terminals  increasing the total to at september  at that date  of these terminals had been open less than months 
the company plans to continue to expand its terminal network 
the company currently plans to open terminals in approximately additional cities in fiscal such plans  however  are subject to change based on a variety of factors 
the expansion of the company s terminals is expected to occur primarily in the united states  canada and mexico 
the company may complement its internal expansion with selective acquisitions 
the opening of a new terminal generally has an initial negative impact on the company s profitability due to operating losses of the new terminal 
the opening of a new terminal generally does not require significant capital expenditures 
additionally  personnel costs are contained at the time of the opening of a new terminal because commissions are generally not paid until salesmen achieve minimum sales levels and until managers achieve terminal profitability 
although future new terminals may be opened in cities smaller than those in which the company s more mature terminals are located  the company believes the results of new terminals should benefit from a ready base of business provided by its existing customers 
the company intends to continue to expand its international freight forwarding business 
international shipments typically generate higher revenues per shipment than domestic shipments 
the company anticipates that the costs of transportation for international freight will be higher than for domestic freight as a percentage of such revenues  resulting in lower gross margins than domestic shipments  however  the company does not expect its operating expenses to increase in proportion to such revenues 
the company also intends to continue the growth of its local pick up and delivery operations 
by providing local pick up and delivery services with respect to shipments for which it is the freight forwarder  the company has been able to increase its gross margin with respect to such shipments because it captures margins which were previously paid to third parties 
however  the company s local pick up and delivery services provided to other non forwarding customers generate a lower gross margin than the company s domestic forwarding operations due to their higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues 
effective october   eagle elected to be treated as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and comparable provisions of certain state tax laws 
from october  until the termination of its s corporation status  the company paid no federal income tax 
for financial reporting purposes  for periods prior to the company s initial public offering  eagle recorded a provision for state income taxes for all states in which it operated 
the company also has recorded for fiscal and the federal income tax liability for each of its subsidiaries  which had paid federal income taxes 
shortly prior to the initial public offering in december  eagle s status as an s corporation was terminated  and for periods thereafter  eagle has been liable for federal income taxes and state income taxes in certain states 
prior to the closing of the initial public offering  eagle declared distributions payable both in cash and in the form of special distribution notes in an amount equal to all of eagle s undistributed s corporation earnings up through such closing 
the final payment of these notes was made in fiscal the company has no plans to pay any dividends or distributions in the foreseeable future 
on october   the company purchased a interest in eagle freight services  inc and c d freight services of california  inc 
from a third party and  during fiscal purchased a interest in freight services management  inc from the company s chairman of the board and initiated operation of eagle usa transportation services  inc and eagle usa import brokers  inc the eagle subsidiaries 
the remaining interests in the eagle subsidiaries were purchased from the company s chairman of the board immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering in december because eagle controlled the eagle subsidiaries  results for fiscal and reflect the operations of all of the eagle subsidiaries as if they had been owned by the company as of the beginning of the period presented 
the company has experienced significant growth primarily through increases in sales at existing terminals and opening new terminals 
the company has also recently completed the acquisition of the assets of a columbus  ohio transportation provider 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company anticipates that its growth strategy in the future will include internal growth in its domestic and international freight forwarding  local pick up and delivery and truck brokerage business  and could also include additional acquisitions 
the company s ability to continue its growth will depend on a number of factors  including existing and emerging competition  the ability to open new terminals  the ability to maintain profit margins in the face of competitive pressures  the continued recruitment  training and retention of operating and management employees  the strength of demand for its services and the availability of capital to support such growth and the ability to identify  negotiate and fund acquisitions when appropriate 
international operations are likely to involve increased costs and risks including those related to foreign regulation  intensified competition  currency fluctuations and exchange controls 
acquisitions involve risks  including those relating to the integration of acquired business  retention of prior levels of business  retention of employees  diversion of management attention  amortization of acquired intangible assets  unexpected liabilities and other problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing any of its business strategy or plans for future growth 
the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  earnings per share 
the company will adopt sfas as required effective october  sfas replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share 
basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
it also requires presentation of diluted earnings per share  which reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities convertible into common stock were exercised

fiscal year ended september  revenues cost of transportation gross profit personnel costs other selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses operating income net income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to increases in the number of shipments and total weight of cargo shipped  which resulted from an increase in the number of terminals open during such period  an increase in penetration in existing markets  and the addition of significant national account customers

cost of transportation increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was the result of several factors 
for the period october to may  several of the company s transportation providers implemented a fuel surcharge which was not in effect during fiscal increased revenues from international freight which generally have lower gross margins than domestic shipments  which were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  also contributed to the higher cost of transportation as a percentage of revenues 
additionally  the reinstatement on march  of the federal air cargo transportation excise tax the federal excise tax  which had previously expired january   negatively impacted cost of transportation as a percentage of revenues for the year 
in fiscal  the federal excise tax expired january  and was not reinstated until august  these factors were additionally offset by the continued expansion of the company s local pick up and delivery operations  which enabled the company to capture margins previously paid to third parties

the company estimates that the ups strike resulted in approximately million in incremental revenue which generated approximately after tax profit on such revenue 
the strike had a slightly positive impact on gross profit margin as the increased traffic from the strike carried higher yields on a per pound basis 
the strike  however  resulted in higher operating expenses primarily personnel costs which offset these higher yields 
the company does not expect to retain any of the business it gained through the ups strike  as the two companies generally occupy separate niches within the freight transportation marketplace

seasonality historically  the company s operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the second quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the fourth quarter has traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern is the result of  or is influenced by  numerous factors including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company s terminal network 
the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and  as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods
