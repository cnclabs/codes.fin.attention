segment information segment and foreign operations information is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes its available cash resources  generated primarily from operations  lease discounting and credit lines will provide adequate funds to finance the company s operations in fiscal the company s financial condition strengthened from fiscal to fiscal the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities improved to to one at september  from to one at september  working capital increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal cash and cash equivalents for fiscal increased by million compared to a decrease of million for fiscal this increase resulted from higher revenues  lower inventory and prepaid inventory  increased stock option exercises and the elimination of the company s dividend 
the primary uses of cash during fiscal were for i an increase in accounts receivable  ii a decrease in accounts payable  iii capital expenditures  iv an increase in capitalized software costs  and v a reduction in long term debt 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from higher revenues  the lengthening of customer payment terms to meet competitive conditions  and an increase in international business  as well as delays in product installations and implementations due to customer site preparation and other factors 
accounts payable decreased due to a reduction of raw material purchases as a result of factory efficiency programs and a change in the timing of payments  which were partially offset by an increase in expenses related to the volume of business 
cash used for investing activities in fiscal of million consisted of capital expenditures for office  manufacturing and research and development equipment and capitalized software research and development costs in both the medical systems and hcis business units 
financing activities provided million in cash in fiscal this was primarily attributable to common stock issued to employees under the company s employee stock option and stock purchase plans and the discontinuance of the dividend payment 
these items were partially offset by a reduction in bank loans during fiscal  which reduced the outstanding borrowings under the company s lines of credit to million at september  from million september   see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
although the company s cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next fiscal year 
however  the company may need to increase its sources of capital through additional borrowings or the sale of securities in response to changing business conditions or to pursue new business opportunities 
there can be no assurance that such additional sources of capital will be available on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding the issuance of recent accounting pronouncements and their expected effect on the company s financial position and results of operations is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
business considerations from time to time  the company may disclose  through press releases  filings with the sec or otherwise  certain matters that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including without limitation those set forth below 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
healthcare information systems the hcis business unit has generated a cumulative operating loss over the past three years  including a substantial operating loss in fiscal  and may generate operating losses in fiscal the company is continuing to invest in hcis to complete the development of the current updates to its products  which the company believes are required to maintain its competitiveness  satisfy customer needs and generate positive customer reference sites to support future sales 
there can be no assurance that hcis will not require even further investment to complete this development or that the development can be completed in a timely manner or that these efforts will generate profits in hcis  which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
competition the markets served by the company are characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition and pricing pressure 
there are a number of companies that currently offer  or are in the process of developing  products that compete with products offered by the company 
some of the company s competitors have substantially greater capital  engineering  manufacturing and other resources than the company 
these competitors could develop technologies and products that are more effective than those currently used or marketed by the company or that could render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in fiscal the introduction by certain of the company s competitors of new products resulted in a decrease in the company s market share for that year 
in the future  these products may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s market share 
dependence on development and commercialization of new products and product enhancements adac s success is dependent upon the successful development  introduction and commercialization of new products and the development of enhancements to existing products 
because the nuclear medicine market is relatively mature  and from time to time in recent years has experienced a decline  the company must continue to develop and successfully commercialize innovative new products and product enhancements such as mcd  and the current updates to the company s products in order to pursue its growth strategy 
failure of the company to market and sell its products effectively in future periods could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the development of new products and product enhancements entails considerable time and expense  including research and development costs  and the time  expense and uncertainty involved in obtaining any necessary regulatory clearances 
the success of mcd depends on a number of factors  including the commercial availability of  fleuro deoxy glucose fdg 
at this time  the infrastructure for the commercial supply of fdg is not well developed 
in addition  although reimbursement has been approved locally by certain private payors and local medicare offices  widespread reimbursement by medicare and private payors for the use of fdg in connection with mcd remains uncertain 
continued uncertainty over reimbursement for the use of mcd could have an adverse effect on sales of mcd  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
government regulation there has been a trend in recent years  both in the united states and abroad  toward more stringent regulation and enforcement of requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers 
the continuing trend of more stringent regulatory oversight in product clearance and enforcement activities has caused medical device manufacturers to experience longer approval cycles  more uncertainty  greater risk  and higher expenses 
there can be no assurance that any necessary clearance or approval will be granted the company or that fda review will not involve delays adversely affecting the company 
in addition  a failure to comply with fda requirements relating to medical device testing  manufacture  packaging  labeling  distribution  promotion  record keeping  and reporting of adverse events could result in enforcement actions including warning letters  such as the one issued to cortet in august  as well as civil penalties  injunctions  suspensions or losses of regulatory clearances  product recalls  seizure or administrative detention of products  operating restrictions through consent decrees or otherwise  and criminal prosecution 
failure of the company to address adequately the concerns raised by the fda in the cortet warning letter could have a material adverse effect on cortet s business and cause fluctuations in the market price for the company s common stock 
the company is also subject to ftc restrictions on advertising and numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection and disposal of hazardous substances 
changes in existing requirements  adoption of new requirements or failure to comply with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
future operating results the company s future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of revenues and operating results prior to the end of the quarter very uncertain 
the timing of revenues can be affected by delays in product introductions  shipments and installations  as well as general economic and industry conditions 
furthermore  of the orders received by the company in any fiscal quarter  a disproportionately large percentage has typically been received and shipped toward the end of that quarter 
accordingly  results for a given quarter can be adversely affected if there is a substantial order shortfall late in that quarter 
in addition  although both the company s bookings and revenue have increased in recent periods  the company s bookings and backlog cannot necessarily be relied upon as an accurate predictor of future revenues as the timing of such revenues is dependent upon completion of customer site preparation and construction  installation scheduling  receipt of applicable regulatory approvals  and other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the orders will mature into revenue 
risks related to acquisitions in the past fiscal year  the company has acquired a number of small businesses  and anticipates that it may continue to acquire businesses whose products and services complement the company s business 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  among other things  difficulties in successfully integrating the businesses including products and services  as well as sales and marketing efforts  failure to retain existing customers of or attract new customers to the acquired business operations  failure to retain key technical and management personnel  coordinating geographically separated organizations  and diversion of adac management attention 
these risks  as well as liabilities of any acquired business whether known or unknown at the time of acquisition  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company  including adverse short term effects on its reported operating results 
the company seeks to mitigate these risks by taking reserves when appropriate in connection with these acquisitions 
in addition  the company has in the past and may in the future issue stock as consideration for acquisitions 
future sales of shares of the company s stock issued in such acquisitions could adversely affect or cause fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
as a result  in two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its internal systems  for year compliance 
management has not yet assessed the year compliance expense and related potential effect on the company s earnings 
in addition  the company is currently seeking to ensure that the software included in its nuclear medicine  healthcare information and other systems is year compliant 
failure or perceived failure of such products to be year compliant could significantly adversely affect sales of such products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues in a variety of ways 
many potential customers may choose to defer purchasing year compliant products until they believe it is absolutely necessary  thus resulting in potentially stalled market sales within the industries in which the company competes 
conversely  year issues may cause other companies to accelerate purchases  thereby causing an increase in short term demand and a consequent decrease in long term demand for the company s products 
additionally  year issues could cause a significant number of companies  including current company customers  to reevaluate their current system needs  and as a result consider switching to other systems or suppliers 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
health care reform  reimbursement and pricing pressure there is significant concern today about the availability and rising cost of healthcare in the united states 
cost containment initiatives  market pressures and proposed changes in applicable laws and regulations may have a dramatic effect on pricing or potential demand for medical devices  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and third party payors  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
intellectual property rights the company s success depends in part on its continued ability to obtain patents  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will mature into issued patents or that third parties will not make claims of infringement against the company s products or technologies or will not be issued patents that may require payment of license fees by the company or prevent the sale of certain products by the company 
reliance on suppliers certain components used by the company to manufacture its products such as the sodium iodide crystals used in the company s nuclear medicine systems are presently available from only one supplier 
the company also relies on several significant vendors for hardware and software components for its healthcare information systems products 
the loss of any of these suppliers  including any single source supplier  would require obtaining one or more replacement suppliers as well as potentially requiring a significant level of hardware and software development to incorporate the new parts into the company s products 
although the company has obtained insurance to protect against loss due to business interruption from these and other sources  there can be no assurance that such coverage would be adequate 
product liability although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it deems sufficient for its business  there can be no assurance that such coverage will ultimately prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock is and is expected to continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in anticipated or actual operating results  market speculation  announcements of new products or technology by the company or its competitors  changes in earnings estimates by the company s analysts  trends in the health care industry in general and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
in addition  broad market fluctuations as well as general economic or political conditions or initiatives  such as health care reform  may adversely impact the market price of the common stock regardless of the company s operating results
