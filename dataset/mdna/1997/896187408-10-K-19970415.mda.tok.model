semiconductor industry downturn 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  which have been characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity 
during  the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn which created a volatile market that resulted in the semiconductor manufacturers rescheduling and pushing out orders due to diminished product demand and production overcapacity 
the company believes that such downturn will continue through at least the third quarter of as a result  the company anticipates reporting lower sales for the first quarter of than the fourth quarter of and anticipates incurring a significant loss during the quarter 
in certain instances  industry downturns have lasted for extended periods of time 
each of trikon s operations have been and will continue to be dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for integrate circuits ic s and products utilizing ic s that are produced by semiconductor manufacturers 
the current weakness in demand in the semiconductor industry  and any continuation of this weakness in the future  is likely to materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations

gross margin on product sales 
the company s gross margin on product sales for the year ended december   was  as compared to and for fiscal and the twelve months ended december   respectively 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to a low gross margin of on electrotech s products shipped for the period from november  to december  the low gross margin was due to the write up of electrotech s inventory on hand to the fair market value of such inventory as of november   resulting from the allocation of the electrotech purchase price as required under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 

the write up increased cost of goods sold by approximately million for the period from november  to december   as the related products were shipped 
there is approximately million in inventory that  as of december   relates to the write up of inventory to the fair market value at the acquisition date  based on apb no 
the million write up will affect cost of goods sold as products are shipped from electrotech in fiscal year gross margins have also been negatively impacted due to issues related to the slower industry conditions noted above  and will continue to be adversely affected in research and development expenses

loss from operations 
the company realized a million loss from operations in fiscal as compared to a million loss from operations in fiscal and a million loss from operations for the twelve months ended december  the loss from operations in fiscal was due primarily to a one time acquisition related in process research and development charge of million  a charge for the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and lower margins on electrotech sales due to the million charge resulting from the allocation of the purchase price to write up inventory values  in accordance with apb no 
which was recorded in cost of goods sold as the related inventory was shipped

interest income expense 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in the twelve months ended december  this was due to income derived from the company s short and long term investments of the proceeds from the convertible notes issued and sold during  until such proceeds were spent in connection with the acquisition  and the proceeds of the public offering of the company s common stock  completed in the third quarter of fiscal interest income in resulted in the company s profitability in fiscal  notwithstanding a million loss from operations

the company recorded a million income tax benefit in fiscal in comparison to accruing only the minimum state requirements in fiscal and the minimum state requirements along with certain foreign withholding taxes for the twelve months ended december  the million benefit represents the combination of a foreign tax benefit associated with the electrotech operating loss and the reversal of deferred tax credits established at november  for the difference in the tax basis and financial reporting basis of the electrotech assets acquired 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to certain one time non deductible charges ie  primarily the write off of the in process technology and losses for which no benefit has been provided

the subsidiaries are subject to taxation in countries where they operate  and such operations generally are taxed at rates similar to or higher than tax rates in the united states 
the payment of dividends or distributions by the subsidiaries to the united states would be subject to withholding taxes in the country of domicile and may be mitigated under the terms of relevant double tax treaties

the use of cash in operating activities primarily represents investments in operating assets and liabilities amounting to approximately million related to sales volume increases and cash operating losses of approximately million 
cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the offering of convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes completed on october  the convertible notes raised gross proceeds of  which amount was used in the acquisition of electrotech 
the convertible notes carry interest that is payable semi annually at an annual interest rate of 
the convertible notes have a maturity date of october  and are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into common stock at the conversion rate of per share

interest is payable quarterly 
the ability to borrow under the note purchase agreement expires january  and amounts borrowed under the note purchase agreement plus accrued but unpaid interest is due on january  amounts drawn under the note purchase agreement are unsecured obligations of the company 
no amounts were outstanding under the note purchase agreement as of december  the note purchase agreement contains covenants that are comparable to those contained in the convertible notes 
on november   trikon consummated the acquisition of electrotech for an aggregate consideration  excluding acquisition costs of million  of million consisting of million in cash and million shares of newly issued common stock having a fair market value of million  based on the per share closing price of common stock on july   the last day prior to the public announcement of the acquisition of electrotech 
the net proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes  borrowings under the working capital facility  and cash and short term investments were used to fund the acquisition of electrotech and to pay off million of short term debt assumed as part of such acquisition 
at december  and march   the company was out of compliance with the covenants established under the working capital facility 
its lenders have granted the company a waiver of such covenant violations as of december  and as of march  the company is negotiating with its lenders to make various amendments to the loan agreement  including revising its covenants for the duration of the working capital facility such that the company will be able to remain in compliance with such amended covenants during the coming year 
company management anticipates completing the amendment and executing such agreement in the second quarter of the company anticipates the amended working capital facility to contain terms similar to those currently in place 
the convertible notes contain certain provisions which provide that  upon the occurrence of an event of default  as defined  could cause the convertible notes to become due and payable immediately 
such an event of default would occur if  among other things  the company were to default on the working capital facility or any other secured indebtedness  as defined  caused by the failure to pay principal and interest payments when due or resulting in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its express maturity in excess of million 
the convertible notes and the working capital facility have been classified as long term debt under the presumption that the working capital facility will be amended such that the company will be able to comply with the applicable financial covenants over the coming year

at december   approximately  remained available for future funding of such research and development 
as noted above  the company does not anticipate that any of such remaining funds will be made available for such research and development 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that cash provided or available from operations  the working capital facility  borrowings under the note purchase agreement and other sources of cash available to the company  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  will be sufficient to support the company s liquidity needs over the next months 
however  if the company is unable to amend the working capital facility under similar terms as currently exists  the company s ability to generate adequate cash may be substantially affected 
impact of inflation although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  to date inflation has not had a material effect on the company s product sales or results of operations
