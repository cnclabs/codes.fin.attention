seasonality and quarterly comparisons historically  the company s revenues have been seasonal  with the highest sales occurring during the months of june  july  and august  and the months of november and december 
these periods correspond to the busy moviegoing seasons 
during these two periods  typically referred to as the summer and holiday seasons  respectively  moviegoing increases and motion picture studios typically release their big budget and most highly anticipated movies 
as a result  the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the company s highest revenue periods 
the advertising sales business is dependent on moviefone call volume 
while call volume tends to rise and fall with movie theater attendance  the company believes that call volume is less volatile than movie theater attendance 
teleticketing volume is generally more volatile than movie theater attendance and moviefone call volume 
when motion picture studios have released big budget  highly anticipated movies  teleticketing volume has increased significantly compared to other periods during the year 
the company believes this higher volume is the result of moviegoers increased concerns about particular performances being sold out 
in addition  motion picture distributors often release high profile movies for exhibition on a limited number of screens during the busy seasons 
the company believes that the limited release of high profile movies further heightens moviegoers concern that a particular movie will be sold out and increases teleticketing volume 
the company typically neither increases its staff during its busy periods nor decreases its staff during the other times of the year 
however  the company has scheduled periodic additions of telephone lines and related computer equipment to its moviefone systems just prior to these two busy seasons 
in addition to fluctuations in movie theater attendance  the company expects that its quarterly results will fluctuate due to its expansion efforts 
as the company expands into new markets and initiates new business activities  its expenses may increase more than its revenues  resulting in quarterly fluctuations in operating results 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its operation to date 
however  substantial inflation driven increases in the costs of labor and telephone service in particular could adversely affect the company s profitability 
impact of new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no
