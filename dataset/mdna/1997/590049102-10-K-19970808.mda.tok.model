soladyne is located in san diego  california  and rogers is one of the company s suppliers of high performance material

one of the company s principal short term objectives is to diversify its customer base in order to grow sales and reduce the risks associated with a concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers 
the company is taking actions to increase sales by broadening its customer base  and expects that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of its sales until efforts to broaden its customer base are successful 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products and services from the company at current levels  that the mix or volume of products purchased will be in the same ratio or that actions to broaden its customer base and increase sales to new and existing customers will be successful

motorola is consuming its existing inventory of these older products  which have been a significant part of the company s sales to motorola 
the company has begun production of the next generation of motorola s products  but expects that future sales of these products will have lower margins 
sales to teradyne  inc teradyne decreased in fiscal due to a decline in teradyne s sales to its customers as a result of a softening in the semiconductor industry earlier in the year 
in addition  the company experienced overall changes in product mix  which caused average selling prices to decline from the prior year 
gross margins 
the company s gross margin was in fiscal year  compared with in fiscal year the company s gross margin can be affected by various factors  including sales volumes  product mix  production yields  price changes and changes in the company s cost structure 
high performance products are generally more complex and carry higher margins than the company s rigid products 
gross margins in fiscal year declined principally due to flat sales combined with a higher level of fixed costs 
a significant portion of the company s manufacturing costs are relatively fixed  and these costs were higher in fiscal year principally as a result of the acquisitions of the loveland and soladyne sites in the middle of fiscal year the level and mix of sales were the major factors in determining the company s gross margin 
the product mix in fiscal year included a greater proportion of lower priced  lower margin products than in fiscal year the company is working to increase the level of sales and to enhance its product mix by targeting higher complexity products which have higher gross margins in order to improve profitability
