item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview the company provides the management services  facilities  administrative and technical support  and ancillary services necessary for physicians to establish and maintain a fully integrated network of outpatient oncology care 
the affiliated physician groups provide all aspects of care related to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer on an outpatient basis  including medical oncology  radiation oncology  gynecological oncology  and diagnostic radiology 
the company earns its revenues principally for services provided under its service agreements with the affiliated physician groups 
the company s management fees the management fees are equal to gross medical billings of the affiliated physician groups gross medical billings less contractual discounts  provision for uncollectible accounts  and amounts retained by physicians pursuant to the service agreements amounts retained by physicians 
the method of determining the management fee earned by the company varies by agreement 
the company s most significant service agreement is with topa texas service agreement  and the management fees paid by topa accounted for approximately of the company s management fees for the year ended december  effective january   the method of calculating the company s management fee under the texas service agreement was amended 
prior to the amendment  the management fee was based upon a percentage of medical practice revenues 
under the amended texas service agreement  the management fee is based upon a percentage of earnings before interest and taxes earnings plus the nonphysician expenses of the related practice locations 
the company and topa believe that this change in calculating the management fee and the related amounts retained by physicians better aligns the incentives of the company and topa for the development and the expansion of services and locations as well as the management of the cost of providing services 
the company believes that as capitated agreements or case rates with payors increase  a management fee based upon earnings is more appropriate and that an increasing percentage of its management fees in the future will be from service agreements with a management fee based upon earnings rather than a percentage of medical practice revenues 
during the year ended december   approximately of the company s management fees was derived from service agreements with a management fee based upon earnings 
effective december   the company adopted a december fiscal year end 
the following table summarizes the derivation of management fees for the periods indicated in thousands

the effect of converting to a single fee schedule was to increase the amounts shown as gross medical billings and increase the related contractual discounts 
the company believes that this change improves its ability to analyze changes in medical practice revenues

in late  a number of changes were implemented with a goal to improving the company s billing and collection efforts 
in addition  the company is in the process of reviewing and selecting software to replace its current practice management software 
net cash used from operations was  for the year ended december   as a result of an increase in amounts due from related parties 
these amounts arise primarily from short term working capital advances made to affiliated physician groups  particularly for the development of new markets and as a result of liabilities assumed at the time of entering into a service agreement but that are reimbursable by the affiliated physician group to the company 
these amounts used by operations were offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the growth in the company s business and the related financing of its expenditures through terms that the company has negotiated with its vendors 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was  during  the company completed and equipped the el paso cancer center that opened in mid june  a diagnostic imaging center located adjacent to the mesquite cancer center that opened in mid may  and remodeled and expanded the plano  sherman  and midland cancer centers

the company currently has cancer centers under construction in abilene  texas  austin  texas  fort worth  texas  and in eugene  oregon 
at december   the company was committed to approximately  million in capital expenditures related to construction and equipment acquisition 
these expenditures are currently expected to be funded primarily from borrowings under the revolver 
net cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december   were  the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock in april with proceeds to the company of  cumulative borrowings under the revolver prior to the completion of the offering were  of which  was borrowed during  and had been used to finance the company s operations

the company believes that the unused borrowing capacity under the revolver will be sufficient to meet its needs in the near term 
recent declines in the market price of the common stock make offerings of common stock to the public unlikely in the near term 
the company believes it has adequate access to other forms of financing at reasonable terms to meet the capital requirements of its construction and network development programs through  including but not limited to increasing the amount available for borrowing under the revolver 
however  no assurance exists that such additional financing will be available in the future or that  if available  it will be available on terms acceptable to the company
