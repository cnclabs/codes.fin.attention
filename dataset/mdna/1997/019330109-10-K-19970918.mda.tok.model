the increase in sales of power and process products consists of a increase in sales of the company s traditional product lines the first such increase since management believes that this trend is the first indication that the downturn in power and process revenues that began after the power industry deregulation law was passed in october may be reversing 
the remainder of the increase in power and process revenues was due to product sales of hia  totalling  sales to international customers increased from  or of sales in fiscal to  or of sales in fiscal foreign sales as a percentage of total sales remained constant because the growth in the company s traditional foreign business was offset by hia s business  which is primarily with domestic customers 
sales backlog increased from  at june  to  at june   comprised of  of traditional product backlog and  of hia product backlog

the company recorded a  restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the reorganization of its canadian and uk operations 
effective june  the net assets and substantially all operations of hathaway instruments limited hil  the company s subsidiary located in hoddesdon  england  were transferred to hathaway systems limited hsl  the company s belfast  northern ireland subsidiary 
in connection with the asset transfer  substantially all operations of hil were combined with the operations of hsl 
in addition  the company decided to close its toronto  canada facility and to combine substantially all of its operations with the operations of hathaway process instrumentation  the dallas  texas division 
the initiatives were aimed at reducing costs and enhancing productivity and efficiency 
the restructuring provision was primarily comprised of estimated costs for employee severance benefits and fixed asset writeoffs 
the payouts related to the restructuring charge were made in and in the first quarter of  management decided to restructure the power products manufacturing operations to produce operating efficiencies and to better utilize local management talent and expertise 
accordingly  the manufacturing operation located in denver was consolidated in into two manufacturing facilities located in seattle  washington and belfast  northern ireland 
the cost of consolidating these manufacturing facilities was not material and was paid in fiscal year as expected  the consolidation of certain manufacturing operations in initially produced some inefficiencies in the manufacturing process due to additional training and start up time required at the remaining facilities 
management believes  however  that the initial issues encountered have been substantially resolved and expects to generate significant cost savings from the consolidation efforts

business acquisition effective september   the company acquired a partnership interest in tate integrated systems  lp and of the stock of the sole general partner  tate integrated systems  inc collectively referred to as tis 
the ownership interests were acquired for an adjusted negotiated price of  of which  was paid in cash at closing on october  and  on june  in addition   will be payable when certain accounts receivable of tis are collected 
tis has operated under the ownership of hathaway industrial automation hia  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the company  since october  hia is located in baltimore  maryland and is a full service supplier of process automation systems for industrial applications 
hia has developed a state of the art software system for supervisory control and data acquisition scada and distributed control systems dcs 
the hia system has been used to fully automate such industrial applications as water and wastewater treatment plants  glass manufacturing plants  oil and gas terminals and tank farm facilities 
in addition to expanding into its traditional process markets  hia s system is being marketed to the power utility industry 
the company expects to team the hia system with certain existing hathaway products and target the combined product at substation automation and integration applications used in the distribution and transmission of power 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the fair values at the date of acquisition 
this allocation is subject to adjustment pending the resolution of certain items 
the company is investing substantial resources in hia  consistent with the company s strategy to expand further into the process industry and to develop applications of the hia software for the power industry 
management believes that the software products developed by hia  as modified for the power industry and combined with other company products  will provide power companies with automated and integrated systems solutions that will both reduce their operating costs and improve the reliability of their power supply 
management believes that there is significant demand in the power industry for such solutions as a result of the business environment created by the recent industry deregulation 
the successful implementation of the company s current business plan is partially dependent on the company s investment in hia producing growth and increased profitability in hia s traditional process automation business  as well as the ability to successfully market hia s products to the power industry 
the factors that will affect the success of implementing this business plan include  but are not limited to  the ability to win a sufficient amount of project work on favorable terms to the company  the ability to complete projects in a timely and cost effective manner  and the existence of sufficient demand for the hia products in both the power and process markets 
an inability to achieve this plan in the planned timeframe may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash decreased  during the year to a balance of  at june  operating activities used  of cash in fiscal compared to  used in and  generated in of the  used in by operating activities   was used to fund the operations of the hia business and  was generated from the operating activities of the company s other businesses 
the overall reduced cash from operations in and is primarily the result of net losses of  and  recorded in and  respectively  compared to net income of  recorded in cash of  was used by investing activities in fiscal compared to  generated in fiscal and  used in fiscal the cash generated by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds of  from maturities of marketable securities 
the cash used for investing activities includes  paid for the interest acquired in tis 
financing activities used   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used for financing activities from to is due primarily to less cash used for the purchase of treasury stock 
the board of directors fiscal decision to discontinue the public stock repurchase program was the primary reason for the lower volume of stock repurchase activity in the decrease in cash used for financing activities from to occurred primarily because no dividends were paid to stockholders in  as compared to  of dividends paid to stockholders in the board of directors did not declare a dividend in because of the net loss recognized by the company for fiscal and dividend restrictions contained in the loan agreement with marine midland business loans  inc see below 
at june   the company had  of debt  compared with  at june   a reduction of  the debt represents borrowings on the company s long term financing agreement agreement with marine midland business loans  inc midland 
the agreement is a reducing revolving line of credit with a borrowing limit that is reduced monthly over the seven year term of the loan 
borrowings on the line are restricted to the lesser of i an amount based on certain asset levels  or ii the borrowing limit 
as of june   the company could borrow an additional  up to the current borrowing limit of  pursuant to the borrowing limit reduction schedule contained in the agreement  the limit will be amortized to   and  in the years ended june   and  respectively  with the remaining unpaid balance of the loan becoming due august  the line bears interest at midland s prime borrowing rate plus at june  
as long as the agreement is in place  interest expense is calculated using the higher of i the actual debt balance or ii of the borrowing limit 
starting in august the company may repay the entire debt balance with midland with no prepayment penalty 
the debt is secured by all assets of the company 
the agreement requires that the company maintain compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net worth  cash flow coverage and current ratios 
the company has not met the quarterly calculated cash flow coverage covenant since the first quarter of fiscal midland issued a waiver of compliance with the cash flow coverage covenant through june  in connection with obtaining the aforementioned waiver  the company agreed to certain conditions  including limiting the assets against which the company may borrow to certain accounts receivable and maintaining higher tangible net worth and achieving certain annual operating results in fiscal in addition  the company agreed not to pay cash dividends  purchase treasury stock except for limited amounts from employees  or make investments in other than investment grade securities without the prior written consent of midland  as long as the company is in violation of the cash flow coverage covenant 
beginning in march the company has not maintained the aforementioned minimum tangible net worth 
in addition  the company did not achieve the aforementioned minimum fiscal operating results 
the company s not meeting these requirements constitutes an event of default under the agreement 
pursuant to the agreement  upon the happening of an event of default  midland may declare any principal outstanding to be immediately due and payable  together with all interest thereon and applicable costs and expenses 
accordingly  the balance of the long term debt has been classified as current as of june  to date  midland has not declared the company s indebtedness to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  the company is renegotiating with midland for a waiver of the aforementioned debt covenant violations 
there can be no assurance  however  that midland will grant such a waiver 
because of the uncertainty regarding the timing of the debt becoming due and payable  the company wrote off the  unamortized balance of the midland loan acquisition costs at june  the company has three joint venture investments in china zibo kehui electric company ltd 
kehui  hathaway si fang protection and control company  ltd 
si fang  and hathaway power monitoring systems company  ltd 
hpms 
kehui designs  manufactures and sells cable and overhead fault location  scada systems and other test instruments within the china market and the company will sell these products outside of china 
si fang designs  manufactures and sells a new generation of digital protective relays  control equipment and instrumentation products for substations in power transmission and distribution systems and the company will sell these products outside of china 
hpms will design  manufacture and sell  under a license from hathaway  instrumentation products designed by hathaway  to electric power companies in china 
there are no future commitments relating to these investments 
the company considers the realization of these investments to be uncertain due to political instability and the untested market in china 
accordingly  the company has fully reserved for these investments 
the company recognizes income from the joint ventures as cash dividends are received 
the company also has an interest in a joint venture jv with kub holdings bhd  a malaysian firm 
the interest  acquired by tis for  in march  was acquired by the company in connection with the purchase of tis effective september  the fair market value of this asset was not significant at the acquisition date 
the jv was created for the purpose of manufacturing  marketing and selling the tis system in certain asian countries 
if the jv requires funding  the company may be required to contribute in accordance with the agreed upon proportions as defined in the jv agreement 
the jv agreement also requires the company to continue as a going concern and to provide support services to the jv at market rates 
if the company does not meet this requirement  it could be required to refund a contractually defined portion  at june  of the  proceeds tis received in from the sale to the jv of licensing and marketing rights to the tis technology 
because of the remote possibility of the company being required to make such a refund  this obligation was determined to be zero at the acquisition date 
further  as of july   the company does not expect that such refunds will be required 
in addition  the company is not aware of any violations of the requirements defined in the jv agreement nor does it anticipate any future violations 
as in the three year period ended june   the company s fiscal working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  including repayment of the entire balance of the midland loan  if necessary  are expected to be funded from the existing cash balance of  at june  in addition  the company may seek additional debt  equity or other financing  particularly if it must fully repay the midland loan balance  in order to supplement its long term financial resources 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional debt  equity or other financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies and lower costs of materials 
the company anticipated that these factors would continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees
