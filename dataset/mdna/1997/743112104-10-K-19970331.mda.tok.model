this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data  the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere herein 
the company s business strategy is to provide commercial banking products and services to individuals and other organizations related to the health care services industry as well as other professionals in california and on a limited basis in other western states 
the company is seeking to increase its market share of loans and deposits through marketing in areas where there is a concentration of health care and health care related activities  through possible acquisitions of other financial institutions and or branches within its target market  emphasizing the expertise and understanding of the medical marketplace that the company has stressed since its inception  and through development of joint relationships expanding the product capability of the company 
the company recorded a net loss of  for the year ended december   compared with net earnings of  in the loss per share for was compared with fully diluted earnings per share of in the net loss resulted in part from a decrease in net interest income as loan and deposit balances declined  certain non recurring costs relating to a proxy contest  and certain non recurring costs relating to a management restructuring in provisions for loan losses also increased from  for to  in  as a result of charge offs and management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company experienced a modest decrease in loan demand as gross loans decreased  or during the year to  at december  the company also experienced a decrease in deposits of to  at december   as compared with  at december  this decrease occurred primarily in time certificates of deposits and was primarily attributable to one client who moved its cash management activities to the corporate headquarters

net interest income the company s operating results depend primarily on net interest income  which represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments less interest paid on deposits and other liabilities 
net interest margin is calculated based on the margin between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as the difference between the balances of average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income before provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or from the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease of approximately  in average interest earning assets  including a decline in loan volume and a restructuring of the investment portfolio  and a decrease of  in average interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits 
loss of net interest income attributable to a decrease in earning assets was partially offset by a basis point increase in net interest margin to in from in net interest income before provision for loan losses was  in  representing a increase over net interest income increased primarily due to an increase of approximately  in deposits which were then placed in higher yielding assets 
time deposits were the primary source of deposit growth and also represented the highest cost of funds 
this increase in earning assets funded primarily by these costly deposits reduced the net interest margin from in to in the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume change 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and interest rates paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowed funds  referred to as a rate change 
the following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the years indicated 
the changes due to rate and volume have been allocated to rate and volume in proportion to the relationship between their absolute dollar amounts

a changing interest rate environment may have a significant impact on the company s net interest margin as measured against average interest earning assets 
management monitors the company s net interest margin by utilizing an interest rate simulation model under various interest rate scenarios 
this process quantifies the impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest margin 
interest rate scenarios are increased and decreased up to basis points in determining the impact on net interest income 
management has limited the impact under these scenarios to no more than percent of net interest income 
these results provide a basis for repricing loan and deposit products after giving consideration to such factors as competition  the economic environment and expected maturities in the loan  investment securities and deposit portfolios 
provision for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses in order to adequately provide for the risks of loss associated with its loan portfolio 
see balance sheet analysis credit risk management and asset quality 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are made through charges to operations as a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for was  as compared with  in and  in the increase in the provision for was primarily due to charge offs  net of recoveries  of  as compared with  and  in and  respectively

mortgage banking operations were initiated in and consist solely of a broker function 
the company  as broker  provides all loan documentation required by the applicable underwriting criteria and respa and sends the material to a funding institution 
the funding institution then approves or declines the loan and  if approved  subsequently funds the loan directly 
the company earns certain fees on the loan for this service

the company and the bank entered into a consulting agreement dated august  with network health financial services  inc nhfs  a california corporation for which melinda mcintyre kolpin serves as president and chief executive officer 
pursuant to the consulting agreement  nhfs provides consulting services to the company and the bank with respect to personnel matters  operational procedures and client development and retention 
nhfs is paid its actual costs incurred in the performance of its duties under the consulting agreement including hourly rates for certain specified nhfs personnel while they are performing consulting services  plus an additional of such costs 
in addition  the company and bank pay flat monthly rates for the services of ms 
mcintyre kolpin and patti derry 
during  the company and the bank paid nhfs total fees in the amount of  pursuant to the consulting agreement 
any party may terminate the consulting agreement by giving days notice to the other parties 
the company is also exploring some form of strategic alliance with nhfs as a primary focus of the company s growth strategy 
excluding these nonrecurring expenses  other operating expenses increased  or approximately from legal fees increased  from due to management s efforts to collect on a number of certain problem loans  of which approximately  was recovered reimbursed through recoveries 
professional services also increased  in as temporary personnel  including outside consultants  were required to continue business on an ongoing basis

balance sheet analysis total assets were  at december   representing a decrease of  or from december  average assets during and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in average assets during was due primarily to a decrease in total deposits  primarily time deposits 
gross loans at december  were  compared with  at december  total deposits at december  and were  and  respectively 
decreased deposits in large part reflect the loss of time deposits of one large client whose cash management activities were moved to the corporate headquarters 
other factors impacting deposit declines were uncertainty created by the proxy contest and staffing turnover throughout decreased loan demand is reflective of impaired marketing efforts related to staff shortages as well as an internal focus on credit administrative practices in lieu of marketing efforts 
moreover  continued consolidation within the health services industry which the company serves has resulted in decreased credit demand in certain of the company s market sectors 
at the same time  this same consolidation has in other sectors created demand for credit in excess of the company s capacity 
loan portfolio the company focuses its lending activities in three principal areas commercial loans  lines of credit and installment loans 
commercial loans include commercial loans secured by the operating cash flow and business assets of the borrower  and to a lesser extent real estate  and unsecured commercial loans 
lines of credit include equity lines  overdraft protection lines and other secured  collateralized and unsecured lines of credit 
installment loans include automobile and boat loans and other loans for personal and corporate use 
the interest rates charged for the loans made by the company vary with the degree of risk  the size and maturity of the loan  the borrowers depository relationships with the company  and prevailing market rates 
although the risk of non payment exists with respect to all types of loans  certain other specific risks are associated with each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans  including real estate secured commercial loans  are the quality of the borrower s management and a number of economic and other factors  including competition  insufficient capital  changes in laws and regulations and general changes in the marketplace  which induce business failures and cause the value of business assets pledged to secure the loan to depreciate 
although the company s portfolio concentration in the health care services industry may expose the company to risks or adverse developments in this sector  including any such developments resulting from health care reform  these risks are mitigated in part by the diversity of clientele within the market niche 
equity lines of credit  installment loans and other lines of credit are affected primarily by domestic instability and a variety of factors that may lead to the borrower s unemployment  including deteriorating economic conditions in one or more segments of a local or broader economy 
the following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by type of credit extension as of the dates indicated 
december  in thousands commercial      real estate secured commercial      subtotal      equity lines of credit      other lines of credit      installment      lease financing total loans      less allowance for loan losses    less deferred loan fees  net net loans      fixed rate      variable rate      total loans      there was no category of loans exceeding of total loans which was not otherwise disclosed as a distinct line item in the above table 
commercial loans represent extensions to a wide array of individuals  companies  both within and outside of the company s market area 
in addition  there were no construction loans outstanding at december  and the company generally underwrites loans on the basis of adequate cash flow  historical  current and as appropriate pro forma  and looks to supporting collateral as a secondary source of repayment in most extensions 
in the opinion of management  the company s loan policies conform with applicable regulatory lending standards 
commercial loans and real estate secured commercial loans 
the company s commercial and real estate secured commercial loans totaled  or of total loans and  or of total loans on december  and  respectively 
of the total  real estate secured commercial loans accounted for only  at december  and  at december  commercial and real estate secured commercial loans consist primarily of short to medium term financing for small to medium sized health care related companies and professionals located in southern california 
the commercial and real estate secured commercial loans are primarily concentrated in the same sectors of the medical community as the company s deposit base is drawn from and consists of sole medical practitioners  small groups practices  large single specialty groups  multi specialty medical groups and other outpatient health care service companies 
real estate transactions are underwritten with cash flow adequacy and diversity as the primary underwriting criteria 
although collateral offered provides adequate secondary support  the underwriting additionally considers other assets net worth available to support repayment 
approximately of total loans at december  were commercial loans which were unsecured or collateralized by various business and personal property assets  including equipment  accounts receivable contracts  and proceeds thereof  including capitation payments 
as a matter of policy  the company s commercial loan borrowers are required to submit financial statements and other financial data for example  accounts receivable agings and enrollment summaries on a periodic basis  in conformity with loan policies and procedures and regulatory guidelines  to loan officers for their review in monitoring the financial position and cash flows trends of borrowers 
under this policy  management generally places a higher level of scrutiny on borrowers failing to submit the required financial information 
senior lending officers review delinquency reports  overdrafts  borrowers payment histories and periodic financial data to monitor creditworthiness and identify potential problem loans 
loan to value ratios on commercial loans secured by real estate generally range from approximately to at origination 
approximately of total loans at december  were commercial loans secured by real estate  but because the company s commercial loans are repaid typically through cash flows from the borrowers business with shorter term maturities three to five years and amortizations usually no longer than years  the commercial loans are not classified by the company as real estate mortgage loans 
equity lines of credit 
at december  and  equity lines of credit aggregated approximately  or of total loans  and  or of total loans  respectively 
loan to appraised value ratios at the loan origination date generally do not exceed and all such loans have variable rate structures 
a majority of these lines of credit are secured by junior trust deeds on residential real estate and require monthly principal payments 
equity lines generally have a five year maturity and are subject to an annual review of the financial condition of the borrower 
other lines of credit 
at december  and  other lines of credit aggregated approximately  or of total loans  and  or of total loans  respectively 
other lines of credit are generally unsecured and include overdraft protection facilities and revolving lines of credit 
overdraft lines are attached to checking accounts to cover short term shortfalls in cash flow 
interest rates are fixed at 
installment loans 
at december  and  installment loans aggregated approximately  and  respectively 
this loan category primarily includes automobile loans 
loan to appraised value ratios at the loan origination date range up to for automobile installment loans with maturity and amortizations generally up to months 
the following table shows the maturity distribution of the company s loans outstanding at december   and is based on the remaining scheduled repayments of principal  as due within the periods indicated 
after one after through through five in thousands one year five years years total commercial    real estate commercial     equity lines of credit    other lines of credit   installment  lease financing total     fixed rate    variable rate     total     loan commitments in the normal course of business  there are various commitments outstanding to extend credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit for working capital  tenant improvements  other term purposes and include standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional principal amount of those instruments 
however  other than letters of credit  all such documents contain legal language that would allow the company an ability for non advance 
accordingly  loss potential is minimized for commitments extended under such document 
at december  and  the company had commitments to extend credit of approximately  and  respectively  and obligations under standby letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
standby letters of credit are commitments issued by the company to support the performance of a client to a third party 
those standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  lease arrangements and similar transactions 
all such standby letters of credit are extended for a period of two years or less 
in making commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses credit policies similar to those used in connection with extension of credit to all customers with creditworthiness evaluated on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on a credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  contract  contract rights and income producing commercial real estate 
credit risk management and asset quality 
management believes that the objective of sound credit policy is to extend loans to qualified customers while managing risks which could affect shareholders returns 
the loan committee  made up of outside members of the board of directors of the bank and executive management  approve credit policy  review asset quality  and determining compliance to credit policy and procedure 
management periodically reviews loan quality and monitors the progress of watch list loans  some of which may require an action plan for rehabilitation or refinancing 
in addition  credit underwriting guidelines are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current economic conditions  industry practices and regulatory guidelines 
in accordance with management s credit administration and regulatory policy  loans are placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal or interest is questionable 
generally  this means that loans are put on nonaccrual status when interest is days or more past due  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection or in the process of renewal 
the table below sets forth information about nonperforming assets  which included nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned oreo  and accruing loans days or more past due and certain ratios december  in thousands nonperforming assets nonperforming loans      other real estate owned oreo other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets      accruing loans days or more past due nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total loans to total loans  oreo and repossessed assets to total assets nonperforming loans and nonperfoming assets do not include accruing loans days or more past due where loan quality is not impaired but rather renewal in process pending receipt of updated financial data 
allowance for loan losses management s determination of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the both actual and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
actual results may  however  differ significantly from such estimates 
in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses where real estate secures the loan  management generally obtains independent appraisals for all properties 
management believes its current appraisal policy conforms to regulatory guidelines 
an evaluation of the overall quality of the portfolio is performed monthly  but not less than quarterly  to determine the level of the allowance for loan losses 
this evaluation takes into consideration the classification of loans and the application of loss estimates attributable to these classifications 
the company classifies loans as pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss based on classification criteria believed by management to be consistent with the criteria applied by regulatory agencies and consistent with sound banking practices 
these classifications and loss estimates take into consideration all sources of repayment  underlying collateral  the value of such collateral  current and anticipated economic conditions  trends  and uncertainties and the historical accuracy of specific reserves attached to loans with serious perceived weakness 
additionally  the company utilizes migration analysis as another means to assist management in estimating the level of the allowance for loan losses 
migration analysis is a statistical method which examines historic charge off and classification trends prior to charge off to estimate potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the above processes provide management with a reasonable basis to estimate the risk both actual and inherent in the portfolio 
in addition  the company utilizes a comprehensive program that considers numerous variables  of which migrations is one  to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for reserves nonspecific to certain credits 
this program is consistent with methodologies in banking circular amongst others  consideration is given to historical and current trends in past due loans  charged off loans  nonaccruals  and the nature and mix of the loan portfolio  and local  regional  industry  and national economic trends in determining loan loss adequacy 
finally  credit administration  corresponding loan policies and procedures  and timely problem loan identification are integral to a sound determination of the allowance for loan losses 
based on information available at december   management was of the opinion that a  allowance for loan losses  which constitutes of total loans  was adequate as an allowance against probable and estimable losses 
while the company s policy is to charge off in the current period those loans for which a loss is considered probable  there also exists the risk of future losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans 
as this risk is continually changing in response to factors beyond the control of the company  such as the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in future periods  while approximate  is in part based on a reasonable methodology 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to record additions or deletions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following tables provide a summary of the company s allowance for loan losses and charge off and recovery activity

interest rate sensitivity an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or can experience an interest rate change 
as interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities have various repricings and maturities  changes in interest rates may increase or decrease the bank s net interest income 
this exposure to changes in interest rates is measured among other methodologies by an institutions gap  or the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified periods of time 
an excess of maturing or repricing assets over maturing or repricing liabilities during a given period will serve to increase net interest income in a rising rate environment and decrease net interest income when interest rates decline 
in a rising interest rate environment  the assets will reprice at current interest rates earlier than the liabilities thus increasing the bank s net interest margin 
conversely  when maturing or repricing liabilities exceed maturing or repricing assets during a given period  a rising interest rate environment generally will reduce the bank s net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of december  the table also sets forth the time period in which assets and liabilities will mature or reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
mortgage backed securities provide cash flows on a monthly basis  however  this analysis does not include prepayment assumptions 
prepayments assumptions are utilized in an interest rate simulation model which is routinely used by the company in evaluating the impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income

these interest rate exchange agreements have a total aggregate notional amount of  under the terms of these swaps  the company received a fixed rate of for a three year period while the company paid the prime rate over the same term 
due in part to these swaps  the company s net interest margin for increased to 
during  as interest rates rose  the company began paying more on these swaps than it received and while the company s net interest margin continued to rise

under the terms of the basic swap  for a period of five years  the company pays an interest rate of prime rate less basis points while receiving the three month london interbank offered rate libor 
because the company s repricing liabilities typically move to a lesser degree than does the three month libor  the terms of the original swap included limits on the interest rate to be received by the company 
this feature of the swap required mark to market accounting and the company terminated this feature of the swap and recorded a pre tax expense of  in although this swap reduces current earnings  the management of the company believes this reduction in earnings is justified by the protection against a narrowing spread

liquidity adequate liquidity and maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest rate sensitive earning assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are the principal imperatives associated with the asset liability management function of a financial institution 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
aside from asset liability management  the company maintains short term sources of funds to meet periodic planned and unplanned increases in loan demand and deposit withdrawals and maturities 
the initial source of liquidity is the excess funds sold daily to other banks in the form of federal funds 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company maintains a large percentage of its assets in investment securities 
these securities include both securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 
securities available for sale can be sold in response to liquidity needs or used as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements 
securities held to maturity are available for liquidity needs solely as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements 
the company had no reverse repurchase agreements on december  and as evidence of the company s high level of liquidity at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  while securities available for reverse repurchase agreements totaled approximately  the combined amount of  represents approximately of the company s total assets 
management is of the opinion that the existing level of liquidity and borrowing capacity is sufficient to insulate the bank against unforeseen liquidity demands 
on a stand alone basis  the company s primary source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
dividends by the bank to the company are subject to regulatory restrictions
