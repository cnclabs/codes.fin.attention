item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cover the fiscal years ended july  and june  on november   brunswick was merged into sti to form mmt 
at the time of the merger  brunswick held approximately of sti s outstanding common stock  which it had purchased from the estate of sti s late founder on april  as a result  sti had been treated for financial accounting purposes as a consolidated  majority owned subsidiary of brunswick from that date 
although sti was the surviving corporation of the merger as a legal matter  the merger was treated as a purchase of sti by brunswick for financial accounting purposes 
as a result  brunswick s historical financial statements became the company s financial statements  sti s assets and liabilities have been revalued to their respective fair values and the company s historical financial statements reflect the combined operations of sti and brunswick after april  subject to minority interests 
the minority interests were eliminated upon completion of the merger on november  for the reasons described above  the fiscal year financial statements of the company contained in this form k are not comparable to the financial statements contained in reports previously filed by sti with the commission  and  due to substantial differences between the revenues and results of sti and those of brunswick  comparisons of results between periods before and after the purchase of brunswick s interest in sti are of limited utility 
therefore  management s discussion and analysis includes comparisons to prior year sti and brunswick s combined proforma operating results to enhance the utility of the information herein 
mmt s business plan following the merger is to operate as a medical device company focusing on early intervention home healthcare and emergency medical technologies 
the company has three areas of business 
the drug delivery systems business capitalizes on injectable drug delivery devices with an emphasis on commercial auto injectors 
this business also supplies customized drug delivery system design  pharmaceutical research and development  and sterile product manufacturing to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the cardiopulmonary systems business focuses on non invasive cardiac diagnostics and telemedicine 
the cardiopulmonary systems business is continuing the research and development activities for the prime ecg tm program  an lead cardiac mapping system for rapid and improved diagnostic accuracy of cardiac ischemia and is planning a us expansion of its telemedicine business 
the sti military systems business focuses on the world wide market for auto injectors used by military personnel for self administration of nerve gas antidotes  morphine and diazepam 
financial discussion mmt s net loss after taxes for the year ended july  was million per share on revenues of million compared to a fiscal net loss of million per share on revenues of million 
included in the net loss for and were write offs of in process r d and merger related costs associated with the combination of sti and brunswick 
these write offs were million and million in and  respectively 
further  in there was a non recurring charge of million for the epiezpen tm product exchange program 
see note of financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the large disparity in revenues between and is a result of brunswick s prior year financial statements becoming those of the company 
only months of sti results are included in revenues 
thus  a more meaningful financial comparison of mmt results is against prior year proforma combined operating results of sti and brunswick 
all comparisons against proforma combined results exclude one time  non recurring merger related costs 
meridian medical technologies  inc 
proforma combined statement of operations thousands net sales    gross margin    of sales selling  general  and administrative expenses    research and development expenses    depreciation and amortization    product exchange program  restructuring charges total    operating income   ebitda    ebitda represents proforma operating income plus other income and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a measure of performance or financial condition under generally accepted accounting principles  but is presented to provide additional information related to debt service capability 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
the proforma combined statement of operations assumes the merger of brunswick and sti was in effect for the three years shown and excludes one time  merger related costs in totaling million and sti in totaling million 
the merger costs consisted of excess purchase price over the book value paid by brunswick which was allocated to in process r d amounting to million in and million in a total of million of transaction costs were paid in by sti 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year in review proforma basis financial results improved over and on a proforma basis 
sales increased to million from million in fiscal and increased from million in operating income was million compared to losses in both fiscal and gross margins were in compared to in and in operating expenses were million higher in primarily because of the non recurring charge for the epiezpen tm product exchange program amounting to million 
results for benefited from record sales of epipen r brand products and cost reduction and fixed cost controls initiated after the merger 
these improvements resulted in operating income increasing by million compared to and million over ebitda was million in  double the ebitda and times the ebitda 
drug delivery business sales were million in  higher than primarily from record epipen r brand sales 
sti military business sales were million  higher than as sales to foreign countries continued to grow 
cardiopulmonary sales were million in  down from million in primarily reflecting the absence of a significant one time product sales promotion which occurred in and the disposition of a non strategic business in late net sales were million in  million or higher than most of the increased sales was in sti military business as the diazepam auto injector and the base maintenance prestocking programs were introduced and contributed a combined million in higher sales 
drug delivery sales were million  slightly higher than sales of million 
higher sales of the newly launched epiezpen tm of million were nearly offset by lower revenues  particularly for the cytoguard aerosol protection device which has now been discontinued 
cardiopulmonary sales were million  million higher than mostly from a significant one time cardiobeeper r sales promotion 
gross margins were of sales in compared to in and in the increased gross margins in resulted mostly from higher sales volume and cost reduction programs initiated after the merger which lowered variable costs and maintained fixed costs 
automation projects reduced labor and a full level of management was eliminated at our st 
louis facility 
gross margins in were of sales  down from of sales in the lower gross margin percentage reflected a product mix change where sti military sales were a larger proportion of total sales in than in and the st 
louis facility experienced plant supply disruptions during the first quarter  operating costs were million in  an increase of million over most of the increased cost was from a non recurring charge for the voluntary epiezpen tm product exchange program million  higher development cost in for the truject tm platform auto injector and continued development of the prime ecg tm cardiac analysis system 
the combination of increasing revenues  lower costs of sales and higher operating costs resulted in operating income growing to million in from losses of  and million in and respectively 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nonoperating costs actual cost basis nonoperating expenses in were million  significantly higher than the  and  in and respectively 
the higher costs reflects a full year of higher interest expense million to finance the merger compared to only months in whose fiscal year ended june  
the interest cost includes amortization of warrants issued to finance the debt amounting to  in and in partially offsetting the interest cost were other income items amounting to  the income tax provision in was  slightly higher than the  provision in minority interest in was  compared to  in reflecting sti net income allocable to minority shareholders of sti prior to the merger 
in october   the company initiated a voluntary epiezpen tm product exchange program to replace all epiezpen tm sold since introduction in with epipens r 
the exchange program was in response to a very small number of epiezpens tm less than which had self activated in the package 
while the exchange was not required by the fda  the company took the action to protect its customers and the quality reputation of the meridian name 
the company does not expect any significant sales impact from this action and is planning reintroduction of the epiezpen tm after all corrective actions are in place 
the company made its best estimate of the costs of the exchange program and recorded a provision in amounting to million 
although no assurance can be given that the reserved amount is adequate  it is intended to cover all cost of the product exchange 
line of business discussion drug delivery sales were million in  higher than mostly from record sales of million for the epipen r family of products 
additionally  higher development revenue was achieved  mostly for a migraine auto injector and licensing fees notably from strategic partners  mylan laboratories and genpharm laboratories  to develop a line of generic injectable drugs 
backlog at year end was million  an increase of over july  reflecting strong demand for the epipen r brand products 
ebitda generated from drug delivery products increased in to million reflecting the higher epipen r revenues and increased margins from cost reduction programs partially offset by the product exchange reserve 
sti military revenues increased in over the prior year to million 
the increase reflects higher sales particularly to foreign allied governments and increased pre stocking for the usdod 
at year end  the sti military backlog was million  an increase of from july  reflecting contract awards from an allied country and the third year of the us dod base maintenance contract 
ebitda generated from sti military systems products was million reflecting higher revenues and a reduction of costs compared to cardiopulmonary product revenues were million  a decline from sales of million 
the reduction was due to the absence of a special one time cardiobeeper r sales promotion in and from disposition of the assets of a non strategic business 
ebitda from cardiopulmonary systems strengthened after the merger as cost reduction activities were implemented 
margins remained steady and development costs  particularly for prime ecg tm  continued 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources total cash balance at july  was  a reduction of  during fiscal the company generated million of cash from operations in cash flow was positive despite the net loss for the year primarily because of noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and the write off of in process r d 
investing activities used million of cash in fiscal with capital additions amounting to million 
the majority of capital was for cost reduction projects  including molds for new lower cost products 
financing activities required million consisting of million for paydown on the bridge loan upon completion of the merger between brunswick and sti in november  and  for payments of debt principal 
these uses were partially offset by a net increase in borrowings of  to finance equipment purchases and  from the working capital line 
in fiscal  principal and interest payments on long term debt will total approximately million 
the company recently increased its asset based working capital credit line with ing capital to a maximum of million from million and had million available at july  senior debt financial covenants with ing capital have been adjusted and the company believes it can comply with such covenants at least through fiscal the company is in active discussion with ing capital to restructure the existing ing capital term loan and to assist the company in a broader refinancing of its long term debt 
no assurances can be made that the company will be successful in this effort and a delay in such restructuring could have an adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
management believes that existing financing sources and other actions available  such as reducing discretionary spending on research and development  capital expenditures and other costs if necessary  will enable it to meet its financing obligations through the end of fiscal however  additional capital is needed to fund its long term planned strategic initiatives and growth objectives 
working capital at july  was  down from million at june  most of the decrease resulted from higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  increased current portions of long term debt of million partially offset by increased inventories 
accounts receivable was million representing days sales outstanding and inventory was million and represented a turnover ratio for the year 
accounts payable at year end was million  up million from june  reflecting higher business levels and costs related to the merger 
borrowings under working capital lines were leaving million available credit at july  total debt at fiscal year end was million or of total capitalization of million 
recent events sale of non core assets the company has entered into agreements to sell two non core assets previously included in the cardiopulmonary business unit 
the first asset being divested  emergency care products generated revenues of approximately million and ebitda of approximately  in the latest months 
the second asset being divested is an esothoracic technology  which is still in the development stage 
it is currently generating no revenue and negative cash flow 
the company has closed on the sale of emergency care product s assets and anticipates closing on the sale of esothoracic technology during the second quarter of fiscal the company expects to realize gross proceeds of not more than million 
there was no impairment of related assets at july  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation in the view of management  the low levels of inflation in recent years and changing prices have had no significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
generally  the company is able to mitigate the effects of inflation on operating costs and expenses through price increases and productivity gains
