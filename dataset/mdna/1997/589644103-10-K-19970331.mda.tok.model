item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the high level of catastrophe and other weather related losses in is principally to blame for breaking the company s several year trend of improved operating results 
extensive property damage claims arising primarily from hailstorms  tornadoes and high winds resulted in the worst year for catastrophic claims in our company s history 
gross catastrophe losses were approximately six times those of an average year 
in spite of the significant increase in the magnitude of such claims  our claims service quality remained high 
the catastrophe activity of should not overshadow certain positive strides made during the year 
a major development was the acquisition of citizens security group inc and its subsidiaries  citizens fund insurance company and insurance company of ohio on july  this acquisition fit well into the company s plan for geographic expansion into additional midwestern and north central states 
the acquisition expanded the company s operating territory into four additional states minnesota  missouri  north dakota  and south dakota  and increased its revenue base in iowa  ohio and wisconsin 
the company also gained control of citizens security mutual insurance company as a result of the acquisition 
direct written premiums for the citizens security group were nearly million for the full year 
underwriting results for citizens security were incorporated into the company s pooling arrangement effective august  the company continues to look for other acquisitions that meet its criteria 
the acquisition of citizens security group  combined with growth in the existing book of meridian business  caused an increase in annualized direct written premiums of approximately percent 
future synergies are expected as the company begins to take further advantage of citizens security s strength in working with certain business associations and as meridian provides a farm product and certain commercial lines products to citizens security 
the company strives for a balanced book of property and casualty business including personal  commercial and farm lines 
during  the company continued the favorable trend of decreasing its operating expenses relative to premiums 
achieving continued reductions in per unit costs and improvement in productivity remain key strategic goals 
meridian has developed an automated personal lines underwriting system that will enable policies meeting certain criteria to be issued without manual review  thus reducing costs without increasing risk 
meridian began testing this system in late by mid  we expect to have most new meridian homeowners and automobile business processed by automated underwriting 
additional efficiencies are expected to result from progress with commercial lines client server processing and agency interface 
results of operations compared to in  the company reported net income of million  or per common share 
this compares to net income of million  or per share 
the results were negatively impacted by a series of severe storms that produced an unusually large volume of property damage claims throughout the company s operating territory 
the after tax impact of catastrophe and other weather related non catastrophic claims is estimated to be approximately per share in  compared to approximately per share in the catastrophe losses represent the largest catastrophe loss total in the company s history 
the company s statutory combined ratio for was percent versus percent for the comparable period 
the company s total revenues in were a record high of million  a percent increase over s million 
the total includes five months of premiums and investment income from the citizens security group companies which were acquired on july  the effect of the citizens security group acquisition on total revenues was approximately million  including approximately million of net earned premiums and million of net investment income 
incremental net income from the citizens security group operation for the five month period ended december  was approximately million  or per share  net of goodwill amortization and interest expense 
the company s largest source of revenue  net earned premiums  increased percent in to million compared to million for the period 
aside from the percent increase in premium volume that resulted from the citizens security group acquisition  premiums earned by the meridian operation increased approximately percent  or million  over the total 
the meridian growth was attributed to nearly all lines of business  with personal lines production increasing percent  commercial lines percent and farmowners achieving growth of percent in earned premium volume 
commercial and personal automobile and homeowners were the primary lines of business contributing to the increased premium volume 
depressing the commercial lines growth was a reduction of approximately million in assumed earned premiums from the national workers compensation pool 
total policy count for the meridian products  on a pooled basis  increased by approximately  policies  or percent over the in force total 
net investment income of million in increased percent over s total of million 
the pre tax net investment yield declined slightly to percent from percent in the reduced portfolio yield resulted primarily from a greater proportion of assets being invested in equity securities and tax exempt bonds 
the average yield of the fixed maturity portfolio is percent 
the investment income generated from the acquired citizens security group investment portfolio was partially offset by a reduction in the meridian portfolio to help fund the purchase 
in  the company realized net gains on the disposition of invested assets of million  or per share net of tax  compared to million  or per share after tax  for the period 
nearly all of the realized gains recognized in were generated from the sale of equity securities which are expected to have little impact on future investment yields 
heavily impacted by catastrophe losses in  the company s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses of million were percent higher than the million reported for the comparable period 
approximately million of the current year losses resulted from catastrophe and other weather related non catastrophic claims 
this compares to approximately million for the period 
the acquisition of the citizens security group business contributed approximately million to the current year loss and loss adjustment expense total  accounting for over percent of the increase 
also contributing to the high volume of losses was an increase in claim severity for meridian s private passenger automobile and commercial multiple peril lines of business 
partially offsetting these losses were improved results in the company s workers compensation and personal and commercial automobile liability lines of business 
the company s statutory loss ratio for deteriorated to percent from s percent 
the statutory loss adjustment expense ratio of percent remained virtually unchanged from ratio 
the company s general operating and amortization expenses of million for the year ended december  were percent higher than the million reported for the same period 
relative to earned premium volume  the company s expense ratio for improved to percent from percent for the prior year 
factors leading to the reduced expense ratio include certain economies of scale and decreases in employee incentive compensation  agent profit sharing and assessments from certain boards and bureaus 
as a result of the citizens security group acquisition  the company incurred approximately  of additional expense in for goodwill amortization and incurred interest expense of approximately  on the related bank loan 
for the most recent year  the company recorded income tax expense of  the low effective tax rate results primarily from the amount of tax exempt investment income in relation to pre tax income 
compared to in  the company reported record highs in net income of million and earnings per common share of 
this compared to net income of million and per share 
the improved results were primarily attributed to increased revenues and a reduction in all three components of the combined underwriting and expense ratio 
total revenues increased percent to million from million while the statutory combined ratio improved to percent from percent for net premiums earned for reflected percent growth to million from s million 
this growth was attributed to nearly all major lines of business 
meridian s personal lines production for experienced growth of percent 
this was primarily attributed to the homeowners and private passenger automobile lines of business  which reflected earned premium growth of percent and percent  respectively 
farmowners achieved earnings growth of percent while meridian s commercial lines of business grew percent over the level 
the increase in commercial lines was attributed primarily to percent growth in the commercial automobile line and percent increase in voluntary workers compensation business 
depressing the commercial lines growth was a reduction of nearly  in assumed earned premiums from the national workers compensation pool nwcp 
this partially resulted from actions taken by meridian to control the type of workers compensation business it would accept in states where the nwcp was unprofitable 
the commercial lines growth was also hampered by soft market conditions  primarily in the state of michigan where premium volume declined from the level 
meridian has addressed its products  rates and personnel in the state of michigan and will continue to monitor these actions for improved results 
total policy count  on a pooled basis  for increased by approximately  policies  or percent  over the total 
net investment income for increased percent to million from million in resulting primarily from a larger invested asset base 
a reduction in the company s pre tax net investment yield to percent in from percent in primarily was a result of a greater proportion of common stocks and tax exempt bonds in the investment portfolio and increased investment expenses 
during the company realized gains on the disposition of invested assets of million compared to million of realized gains for the prior year 
such gains were realized primarily on the sale of common stocks and have an insignificant effect on future investment yields 
the company s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses of million for increased percent over s million  primarily as a result of the increased volume of business 
the statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved to percent in comparison to percent for the previous year 
the company reflected improved results in its commercial multiple peril  homeowner and workers compensation lines of business 
the loss ratio for commercial multiple peril improved significantly from s ratio of percent to a percent ratio in homeowners also recorded a reduction from percent in to percent in a reduction in liability claims for the current period was the primary reason for the improvement in these lines of business 
the company also experienced improved underwriting results in both the voluntary and involuntary workers compensation lines 
partially offsetting these improvements was deterioration in the personal and commercial automobile and farmowners lines of business 
the loss ratio for personal and commercial auto increased to percent from percent in primarily as a result of increased severity 
the deterioration in the farmowners loss ratio to percent for from percent in was caused by a rise in liability claims 
general operating expenses incurred during of million decreased percent from million reported for lower state income taxes  reduced assessments from the nwcp and certain economies of scale were the primary contributors to the expense reduction 
the reduced expenses  combined with a slight reduction in the company s average commission rate  produced a statutory expense ratio of percent for the current period compared to percent for the prior year 
amortization expenses of million for the period increased percent from million  corresponding with the company s growth in premium volume 
the company s effective tax rate in increased to percent compared to the prior year s percent 
this increase was attributed to an overall growth in taxable income causing the company to be subject to less relative impact of tax exempt income and the dividends received deduction 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for liquidity is to pay shareholder dividends  and its main source of liquidity is the receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
the company s subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations which restrict their ability to pay dividends 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the principal need of the company s insurance subsidiaries for liquid funds is the payment of claims and general operating expenses in the ordinary course of business 
the funds of the company s insurance subsidiaries are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate cash to pay such claims and expenses without forced sales of investments 
the average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is years 
over the next year  a relatively small portion of the company s bond portfolio is scheduled to mature 
approximately percent of the company s investment assets are held in fixed maturities  substantially all of which are believed to be readily marketable 
within the fixed maturity portfolio  the company holds approximately percent in mortgage backed pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the company has attempted to reduce the prepayment risks associated with mortgage backed securities by investing a majority of the collateralized mortgage obligations in planned amortization and very accurately defined tranches 
these investments are designed to alleviate the risk of prepayment by providing predictable principal prepayment schedules within a designated range of prepayments 
the company has no exposure to high risk derivatives in its portfolio 
the company s fixed income investment portfolio consists almost entirely of investment grade securities  the average quality of which is rated aa aa 
the company currently holds all of its fixed maturity investments in the available for sale category which are carried at market value 
the company at december  recorded unrealized gains in the bond portfolio of approximately million  net of deferred income taxes 
at year end  the company recorded unrealized gains on the bond portfolio of approximately million  net of deferred income taxes 
net unrealized appreciation of investments added to the company s book value per share at december   similar to unrealized appreciation adding per share to the book value at december  on july   the company completed the acquisition of citizens security group inc of red wing  minnesota 
the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of citizens security group and its wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries  citizens fund insurance company and insurance company of ohio  for approximately million in cash  including capitalized acquisition costs  and became affiliated with citizens security mutual insurance company 
approximately percent of the purchase price was generated from the sale of a portion of the company s investment portfolio 
the remaining million was financed through bank debt and is being amortized over seven years with a variable interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed being recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the excess cost over the fair value of the net assets of approximately million was recorded as goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over a year period 
beginning in  state insurance regulators required companies to calculate risk based capital rbc 
rbc is the capital required to cover the varying degrees of risk inherent in a company s assets  loss reserves  underwriting  and reinsurance 
the company action level rbc is the minimum amount of capital required in order to avoid regulatory action 
in  the adjusted capital of the company s insurance subsidiaries is well above the required minimum 
impact of inflation inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses is known 
the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation in establishing rates  subject to limitations imposed for competitive pricing 
the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses are management s estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of inflation  the normally higher investment yields may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses
