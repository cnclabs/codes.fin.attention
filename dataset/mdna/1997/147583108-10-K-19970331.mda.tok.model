the company s selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in to million  which represented of total revenues compared with million in  which represented of total revenues 
the increase is primarily attributable to increases in personnel  marketing and advertising and facility costs resulting from the expansion and rollout of msp operations in mississippi  nevada and native american lands in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses also reflects costs associated with the addition of technical staff to support the expanding base of oasis ii system customers  the addition of experienced gaming marketing and operations executives  and the establishment of the company s cds games division

contracts for oasis ii system sales generally specify that the price is to be paid in three or four installments as progress is made toward completion and that final payment under the contract is not made until the expiration of an acceptance period during which time the customer and applicable regulatory authorities may test and approve the company s oasis ii system 
systems and products the company experienced an increase in oasis ii systems sales in fiscal compared to fiscal among the key factors affecting the receipt of new oasis ii systems orders are the rate of growth in the gaming industry  replacement of existing systems  a broadened product line  and continued acceptance of casino information management systems by the casino customers 
the company does not expect that such favorable results will be repeated in fiscal and may see sales declines in this business segment 
the continued expansion of gaming markets is dependent upon political  legal and other factors which are beyond the control of the company 
notable quarterly variations in revenue and income may occur while casino management information systems constitute a primary source of revenue 
the addition of new software modules to the oasis ii system  such as proturbo  slothost and maintenance monitor  increased the portion of oasis ii system revenues attributable to software 
the company intends to continue to add new software modules to further increase the functionality of the oasis ii system 
the company is developing a windows version of the oasis ii system and several additional software modules 
these new products will further increase the portion of system revenues generated from software sales which could increase the overall gross margins on oasis ii system sales 
however  no assurance can be made that the company will successfully complete such products 
progressive operations the company introduced its first msp system  cool millions  in mississippi in november and in nevada in may the company introduced its cool millions quarters product in nevada in april and in mississippi in june the company also introduced its cool millions and cool millions quarters products in native american lands in august an msp system links slot machines at various locations electronically to a central monitoring system operated by the company

the company is responsible for the primary and secondary jackpots  and derives revenue only from optional progressive coin wagers 
the primary jackpot is paid in twenty equal  annual installments 
while casinos have experienced positive results  caribbean stud video poker has performed significantly below company revenue and profit expectations 
the fixed royalty payment to cti was based on the original company expectations 
the company s business partner is currently seeking gaming licensing in nevada which would allow the business partner to form a joint venture with the company 
upon formation of the joint venture the company would no longer pay its business partner the fixed royalty payment 
the company is evaluating the caribbean stud video poker product and the agreement with cti to determine the best course of action for the company 
although the results of the licensing hearing or the possible contract renegotiations cannot be predicted  the outcome of these events will likely have a material impact to the company 
in the second quarter of  the company enhanced its msp system software to permit its msp system central monitoring facilities to monitor data from multiple msp systems  including cool millions  cool millions quarters and caribbean stud msp systems
