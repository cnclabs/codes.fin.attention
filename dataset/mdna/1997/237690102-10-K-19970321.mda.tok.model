the company experienced an overall decline in sales and orders for the company s products during orders declined approximately to million in  compared with million in the company believes the declines in overall programming systems division sales and orders were primarily due to a slowdown in capital spending by electronics manufacturing companies in the united states and europe which reduced the demand for the division s products 
the company believes that the economic slowdown in capital spending for electronics manufacturing equipment has bottomed out and is beginning to turn upward 
the company believes that increased competition  in areas where new data i o product introductions are not scheduled to occur until  or where products are nearing the end of their product life cycles  is also affecting sales 
the company s current expectations are that these new products will not be available in production quantities until the second half of and early in addition  the company believes the declines in non automated programming systems also reflect the continuing market shift away from the company s traditional line of higher priced ic programmers for the engineering market  toward lower priced programmers 
the company believes the market shift toward lower priced ic programmers has been caused in part by advances in semiconductor processing technology that have lowered the barriers to entry in the programmer business over the last several years 
this has caused new market entrants to appear regularly  each trying to carve out a niche 
new entrants cause downward price pressure  and each cycle of new competitors lowers the acceptable price of a conventional ic programmer in the customer s view 
in addition  the company believes that technological improvements in personal computers and design software tools have caused a shift in the demand for ic design tools by engineering design teams away from hardware tools in favor of increased software design tools 
these industry changes had  and are continuing to have  an adverse effect on the company s ic programmer sales and gross margins  especially because the company s products historically have been oriented toward hardware tools and  within hardware tools  toward higher priced ic programmers 
page however  the company believes that recent changes in programmable ic technology  such as increasingly complex logic ics lower voltage requirements and higher pin counts  and the increasing need for higher quality and high volume programming by users of programmable ics means that there is a significant market need for more sophisticated programmers and automated programming systems 
the company currently has development projects underway for new programmer and automation technology to address the needs created by these technology changes 
the company believes the decline in overall automated handling systems sales and orders in were primarily due to the slowdown in capital spending by electronics manufacturing companies 
the company believes that in the electronic manufacturing market  the expanded use of programmable integrated circuits in the mid to high volume manufacturing environment and the proliferation of hard to handle surface mount packages in a variety of types is causing a worldwide trend toward automation and integration of manufacturing processes 
the company believes that increased competition  in areas where new data i o product introductions are not scheduled to occur until  such as the promaster  is affecting sales 
the company continues to believe that its product line  as well as the products under development  its worldwide service capabilities  and technology leadership will keep the company in a position to capitalize on the trend toward automation and integration of manufacturing processes 
the company believes the sales growth in the synario design automation division s software products  including synario and ecs  is due to greater market acceptance of windows based eda software products as well as continued product enhancements 
synario is targeted at the change in the industry demand toward greater usage of software products and at the company s belief in the emerging windows based eda market 
the company believes synario is well positioned to take advantage of the adoption of the windows environment by users of eda software tools 
sales growth in the company s semiconductor equipment division products was due to having a full year of sales in after the purchase of reel tech in august of sales for the fourth quarter of grew compared to the fourth quarter of during april of  the company moved and expanded the indianapolis  indiana factory to provide additional capacity 
the company believes that a slowdown in capital spending due to overcapacity and price competition by dram semiconductor manufacturers  among reel tech s primary customers  has slowed the growth of reel tech in recent quarters 
the company believes that this slowdown has bottomed out  which is supported by reel tech  inc experiencing increased bookings in the fourth quarter 
the company experienced a small increase in international sales during due to increased sales in asia  which were partially offset by declining sales in europe due to the slowdown in capital spending by electronics manufacturing companies in europe and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the foreign currency exchange rate changes reduced sales by approximately million during compared to these declines were due primarily to rate changes for the german mark and the japanese yen 
when the us dollar is stronger  sales of the company s products in local currency translate into fewer us dollars 
however  offsetting the revenue translation impact is the translation of local currency costs and expenses 
vs 
programming systems division products experienced year over year revenue growth due primarily to increased sales of automated programming and handling systems which was partially offset by a decline in sales of the company s non automated programming systems and the company s older software design tools 
the addition of semiconductor equipment division products  obtained as part of the reel tech acquisition in august of  also provided incremental sales growth 
the company experienced decreased sales for the non automated programming systems products used primarily in the engineering market 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in sales of non automated parallel programming systems used in the manufacturing market 
the overall decline reflects the continuing market shift  technology changes and competitive situation discussed above for sales of the company s programming systems division software products decreased by in compared to which contributed to the decline in the non automated programming systems products 
the company s older software design tools  including abel and futurenet  declined due to competitive pricing pressures  product aging and the discontinuation of the futurenet product 
the company believes the growth in sales of the company s automated programming and handling systems for the manufacturing environment increased due to a trend toward the expanded use of programmable ics in high volume manufacturing situations 
the company believes this trend is due to a reduction in the cost of programmable ics relative to page fixed ics  the desire of manufacturers to improve the time to market for new and improved products  and the increased functionality and miniaturization of programmable ics 
a market shift in the promaster product mix toward higher priced models also contributed to the sales increase 
the company s most recently introduced products  promaster  promaster  promaster and tape and reel  provided this growth during the company believes the sales growth in the synario design automation division software products  including synario and ecs  was due to greater market acceptance of windows based eda software products as well as product enhancements 
sales of the company s semiconductor equipment division products  acquired as part of the reel tech acquisition  were approximately  the company believes the market for semiconductor equipment experienced strong growth in as semiconductor manufacturers expanded capacity in response to demand for ics 
international sales were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation which increased sales by approximately million in compared to  primarily due to rate changes for the german mark and the japanese yen which strengthened relative to the us dollar during gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net sales vs 
the gross margin decreased in dollars and as a percentage of sales during compared to the decrease in gross margin is due primarily to lower volumes  lower product margins and increases in inventory reserves 
the relatively high fixed component of cost of goods sold causes any swing in total volume to have a significant impact on gross margin 
the shift in mix of product revenues from higher priced and higher margin non automated programming systems to the lower priced alternatives has lowered the overall product gross margins 
also contributing to the decline of gross margin was the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the japanese yen and the german mark  in which approximately of the company s sales are denominated 
vs 
the gross margin increased in dollars during compared to while staying approximately the same as a percentage of sales 
the increase in gross margin dollars is due primarily to the increase in sales volume 
the company experienced improved gross margins on automated programming and handling system products in due to increased volume and a shift toward higher priced models 
offsetting this improvement is a shift in the mix of sales of the company s non automated programming systems products from higher priced  higher margined products toward lower priced alternatives which has lowered the overall margins for this product line 
the shift in the product mix to a lower overall percentage of software sales  which have higher gross margins  has had an additional offsetting impact 
in addition  the gross margin on the promaster was below that of the company s traditional automated programming and handling systems due to higher material and labor costs 
finally  gross margin was favorably affected by improvements due to the positive currency effects of a weaker us dollar 
page research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales vs 
research and development spending increased both in amount and as a percentage of sales in compared to the spending increase is primarily due to the inclusion of expenses for the company s reel tech subsidiary acquired in august of  additional product development projects  including those related to products slated for introduction in  and additional engineering staff compensation costs 
the company expects to continue its significant investment in research and development  especially for projects related to planned product introductions 
the company believes it is essential to invest in research and development to support its existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
the company is focusing its research and development efforts in its strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology  automated handling systems for the manufacturing environment  windows based eda software design tools and semiconductor handling equipment 
the company expects to continue this focus in the future and believes that it is essential to invest in research and development to support its existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
vs 
research spending declined slightly both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the decline is primarily due to lower personnel costs which relate primarily to open job positions during the year 
the company focused its research and development efforts in on its strategic growth markets  namely automated programming and handling systems  windows based eda software design tools  low priced project specific ic programmers and semiconductor equipment 
the charge for in process research and development acquired as part of the august reel tech acquisition of  is not included in research and development expense 
selling  general and administrative in thousands change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales vs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenditures during relative to is primarily due to decreased commissions  incentive compensation and decreased expenses in the company s foreign offices  due in part to currency rate changes 
partially offsetting this is the inclusion of expenses for the company s reel tech subsidiary acquired in august of vs 
the actual dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenditures in was due to increased marketing and promotion expenditures  increased commissions resulting from the sales volume increase and increased expenses in the company s foreign offices due to currency rate changes 
partially offsetting this increase were reductions in spending due to the company s restructuring efforts 
page business restructuring during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pretax charge of million related to the restructure of its sales and distribution channels  downsizing its operations to a level consistent with anticipated lower sales and product margins  and consolidation and outsourcing certain manufacturing processes 
of the total million restructuring charge  the company paid approximately million in cash in including approximately  of previously accrued vacation and pension payments  million in including approximately  of previously accrued vacation and pension payments   in   in and expects to pay the balance of approximately  in in addition  since inception of the restructuring  the company recorded approximately  in asset write downs related to its restructuring 
during the fourth quarter of  the company continued its restructuring activities related to its sales and distribution channels by closing its sales and service operation in the united kingdom 
the lease termination  loss on equipment disposition  severance  and closure expenses of approximately  were charged to operations 
offsetting this charge was a reversal of certain amounts provided for in the original restructuring for outsourcing certain manufacturing processes which will not be used 
other than remaining abandoned lease obligations which runs out over the next year  the restructuring has been completed 
during the fourth quarter of  asset and accrued liability accounts associated with the plan were adjusted such that the total restructuring costs were lowered by  or of the original plan 
the restructuring plan changed  in  primarily as the company experienced difficulties in proceeding as planned on outsourcing certain manufacturing processes 
the effect of this in  was a delay in accomplishing portions of the outsourcing plan  resulting in continued usage of certain production equipment beyond the time that was originally planned  as well as reductions in originally contemplated costs 
interest in thousands change change interest income interest expense vs 
interest income decreased during compared with  primarily due to a decrease in the average level of funds available for investment and a decrease in the average investment interest rates

income taxes in thousands change change income tax expense effective tax rate vs 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the expected benefit at the statutory tax rate primarily due to the establishment of additional tax valuation reserves 
the additional valuation reserves were due to an inability to record a benefit for foreign tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as well as the reduced ability to offset reversing temporary differences against taxable income after carrying back the tax loss 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
page the company had valuation allowances of  at december  compared to  at december  and  at december  the valuation reserves may increase should the company continue to experience losses or reverse as the company records income 
the potential reversal of these valuation allowances may significantly reduce the company s effective tax rate in vs 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to reversal of tax valuation reserves established in the reversal of valuation reserves was due to the utilization of foreign subsidiary loss carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as well as the offset of reversing temporary differences against taxable income

net income and earnings per share in thousands change change net income loss    percentage of net sales earnings loss per share vs 
the decrease in net income and earnings per share in compared with is primarily due to a combination of decreased sales volume  a lower gross margin percentage  increased costs and operating expenses resulting from the company s acquisition of reel tech as well as spending on new development projects and recording of deferred tax valuation reserves 
vs 
the change in the company s profitability was due primarily to the increased sales volume  the reversal of a portion of the restructure accrual  reduced costs and operating expenses resulting from the company s restructure and the reversal of deferred tax valuation reserves 
offsetting a portion of this was the charge of  net of tax for in process research and development related to the reel tech acquisition 
inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the past  the company has been able to offset the impact of inflation with efficiency increases and price adjustments 
heightened competition has made the company s products subject to more price competition and has diminished its ability to offset the impacts of inflation 
sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates of exchange during the year 
to date the foreign currency rate changes have not significantly impacted the company s profitability 
this is because only approximately one quarter of the company s sales are made by foreign subsidiaries  independent currency fluctuations tend to minimize the effect of any individual currency exchange fluctuations and the effect of individual rate changes on sales and expenses tend to offset each other 
additionally  the company hedges its foreign currency exposure on the sales of inventory and certain loans to its foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign exchange contracts

page financial condition liquidity and capital resources in thousands change change working capital      total debt    working capital decreased during the primarily due to funds used to repurchase common stock as discussed above 
this decrease was partially offset by funds provided by operations 
the company s trade accounts receivable decreased by approximately million during this decrease was primarily due to decreased sales volume in the company decreased its inventory level by  during the company had experienced an inventory increase during the first half of  primarily due to having purchased inventory in anticipation of a higher sales volume than occurred  to support anticipated growth in the semiconductor equipment products as well as to provide a level of safety stock during the anaheim factory relocation which was completed in march the company expects to continue to reduce its inventories during the next year to better align inventory levels to the sales volume 
accrued expenses declined compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased accrued incentive compensation and payment of accrued restructure costs 
the use of million of cash to repurchase  shares of common stock during was partially offset by stock sale proceeds of  under the company s employee stock benefit plans 
as of december   the company had total debt of million or approximately of its million in equity 
of this total  approximately  is current debt  consisting entirely of borrowings on its foreign line of credit 
the million of long term debt consists of a note due in for the balance of the purchase price for cad cam see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company also had an unused million us line of credit maturing in may under which borrowings would incur interest at the bank s published prime rate or the libor rate plus basis points 
the foreign line of credit of million matures in november historically  this debt and the us line of credit  have been structured as short term and have been continuously renewed on their maturity dates 
the company currently expects to be able to renew these lines of credit on maturity under substantially the same terms as those presently in place 
no assurances can be made  however  in regard to the renewal of these agreements 
the company has accrued a  payment obligation in connection with the acquisition of reel tech which is expected to be paid during additional contingent acquisition related payments of  are dependent on future operating results which may be achieved and become payable in whole or in part in or the company estimates that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment during will be approximately million 
such expenditures are currently expected to be funded from internally generated funds and  if necessary  borrowings from the company s existing credit lines 
although the company fully expects that such expenditures will be made  it has commitments for only a small portion of these amounts 
at december   the company s material short term unused sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings of million under its us line of credit and approximately million under its foreign line of credit 
the company believes these sources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient during to fund working capital needs  service existing debt  finance planned capital acquisitions  fund the reel tech contingent payment obligations and fund its remaining restructure accrued liabilities 
additional capital will also be provided if the company successfully disposes of its redmond headquarters property see note of notes to consolidated financial statements
