factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  among others  growth through business combinations and internal expansion  the ability to attract and retain qualified employees and consultants  dependence on asi s ability to continue to obtain new contracts for its services  management of a large and rapidly growing business  assimilation of recently acquired businesses  project risks associated with higher than expected costs to perform under contracts  pricing and margin pressure  and competition 
general market conditions also may affect future results  including the economic health of the utilities market  international economic conditions  local tax collections and other budgetary constraints applicable to municipalities  municipalities  and federal government spending levels 
many of these factors are beyond the company s ability to predict or control 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance

the percentages on the left show the relationship of various income and expense items to net revenues 
the percentages on the right measure year to year changes 
percentage of sales year ended september percentage change to to sales costs and expenses salaries  wages and related benefits subcontractor costs general and administrative depreciation and amortization earnings from operations interest expense other expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings rounded to the nearest whole percent 
compared to the company continued its strategy of acquiring key participants in the gis data conversion service industry through its acquisition of mse corporation mse in july mse s primary focus has been to provide data conversion services to utilities  so that the acquisition has further increased the company s penetration of that market

the combination of salaries plus subcontractor costs remained at of sales  while salaries increased as a percentage of sales from to and subcontractor costs decreased from to 
this shift from subcontractors to salaries enables the company to perform more tasks internally and reduce its use of external subcontractors 
interest expense  which increased by from to  represents virtually the entire amount of other expenses 
most of the increase in interest expense was attributable to term debt undertaken to fund the acquisitions 
earnings per share increased by in over the increase in net earnings of was partially offset by the increase in average common shares outstanding 
common shares outstanding increased primarily due to the issuance of  shares in july in connection with the acquisition of mse and the issuance of shares from the exercise of stock options 
the company s backlog of signed contracts increased to approximately  up from the company s expansion strategy has enabled it to obtain significant contracts with utilities customers  as well as municipal customers and commercial companies 
some of these projects are large  multiple year contracts that offer the company the benefit of increased work but also subject the company to increased risks due to possible inflation and changing customer expectations 
the company continues to seek and perform both larger and smaller projects for future work 
compared to the company acquired intelligraphics inc intelligraphics in december in order to implement a strategy to enter the utilities facilities data conversion market 
the acquisition allowed the company to enter the utilities data conversion market more quickly and at a lower cost than would have been the case under a strategy of developing the technology and market presence internally 
the utilities data conversion market is highly competitive  and margins are generally lower than those earned by the company in its other markets  but the lower margins are usually mitigated by the larger contract size and term and the expected greater volume of conversion work to be done in this market 
a second acquisition in july  westinghouse landmark gis  also contributed to the company s growth strategy and provided the capability to perform deeds research tax mapping  which the company had conducted through outside subcontractors 
this acquisition also provided additional capacity in the company s photogrammetry and cadastral mapping markets  as well as an enhanced regional presence in the east and southeast regions of the united states

the two acquisitions have permitted the company to complete a greater proportion of its production work using internal resources as opposed to outside subcontractors 
interest expense increased by from to  due to the increased debt undertaken to complete the two acquisitions 
earnings per share increased by over the previous year 
this increase reflects the increase in net earnings all from operations and the increase in average common shares outstanding in over approximately of the increase in average shares outstanding is the result of  shares issued in connection with the intelligraphics acquisition  and the balance is due to the issuance of shares for stock option exercises

cash flows from operations were reduced by increased investment in the net current assets of the company  principally due to accounts receivable and revenues in excess of billings 
these contract related balances fluctuate due to the aggregate effect of the progress on specific projects and billing and payment terms of the contracts for such projects 
cash flows used in investing activities are comprised of the cash component of the cost of the net assets acquired in the mse acquisition and routine capital equipment additions 
cash flows from financing activities are comprised of the proceeds of term debt used for the cash component of the cost of the net assets acquired in acquisitions  routine use of the company s bank line of credit  scheduled debt repayments  and the proceeds of stock option exercises

recent accounting pronouncements for the quarter ended december   the company will be required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
earnings per share sfas 
sfas requires the restatement of all prior period earnings per share eps data 
sfas replaces the presentation of the primary eps  with a presentation of basic eps and diluted eps 
under sfas  basic eps excludes dilution for common stock equivalents and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
upon adopting sfas  the company s diluted eps will be the same as the income per share as currently reported by the company  while the company s basic eps will be greater than the income per share as currently reported
