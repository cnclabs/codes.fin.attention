item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview eai specializes in developing and applying three dimensional d visualization technology to meet the productivity  communication  education and entertainment needs of its clients through three interrelated product lines d visualization software  interactive multimedia and custom animation 
eai s d visualization software products enable clients in the automotive  aerospace  heavy equipment and other manufacturing industries to collaborate in real time using digital prototypes 
eai s multi platform products integrate seamlessly with most popular cad cae environments 
eai s interactive multimedia products apply advanced d technology to programs developed for clients targeting the consumer and educational markets 
in addition to titles published on cd rom  eai also produces customized interactive programs for specific educational and training situations  including museums  libraries  hospitals and universities 
the company s custom animation products combine proprietary animation technology with d rich content to address the communication needs of clients in the biomedical  multimedia  entertainment  litigation and corporate communications markets 
the company uses an extensive library of models and textures in addition to a proprietary engineering database to create detailed and scientifically accurate animations that conform to the laws of physics 
sales of custom animation products were eai s original source of revenues 
revenues from interactive software products initially consisted of government grants  which the company sought in order to assist it in developing its proprietary animation resources 
beginning in  interactive software product revenues largely reflect development fees paid to the company by publishers that have agreed to distribute the company s interactive software products 
in december  the company completed its first interactive software title  the dynamic human 
in  revenues from interactive software products continued to increase as the company introduced additional consumer titles 
the company expects that near term interactive software product revenues will consist primarily of development fees  as well as royalties from sales of certain of its interactive software titles 
in march  the company introduced a line of d software products based on technology used in the production of the company s custom animation products 
these products integrate both cad and cae analysis to provide complete visualization and communication solutions to the engineering design and analysis market 
while the business of the company as a whole has not historically experienced significant effects of seasonality  the company anticipates that sales of certain interactive software products may be affected by seasonality 
consumer purchases of interactive software products may experience some effects of seasonality created by the christmas holiday 
in addition  eai s sales of interactive software products in the academic markets may experience some effect of seasonality created by the academic school year 
therefore  as sales of interactive software products increase  the company s revenues as a whole may experience some effect of seasonality 
the company has scheduled several product introductions in due to the inherent uncertainties of software development  the company cannot accurately predict the exact timing of new product shipments  nor can the company be assured that any significant revenues will be derived from these product offerings 
any delays in the scheduled release of these products  or any failure to achieve market acceptance of such products among new or existing customers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results

income taxes s expense  effective tax rate in  the company began filing its income taxes on the accrual basis rather than on the cash basis used in prior years 
the company in used its net operating loss carryforward of  which was a result of using accelerated depreciation  expensing software development costs for tax purposes and filing the company s income tax return on a cash basis 
deferred tax expense results from temporary differences in recognition of revenues and expenses for income tax and financial statement purposes 
liquidity and capital resources the company historically has satisfied its cash requirements through borrowings  customer advances  capital lease financings and net proceeds of approximately million from the company s initial public offering of equity securities in february as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
net cash used by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to increased receivables  offset by net income  depreciation and increases in accrued expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used by operating activities was million for the year ended december  in  the company used cash of million in its investing activities  of which million was used to purchase short term investments  million was used to purchase property and equipment   was used for development of software and  was paid as an advance to the developer of the company s new office building 
in  the company used cash of million in its investing activities  of which million was used to purchase property and equipment   was used for the development of software and  was paid as an advance to the developer of the company s new office building 
in  net cash of  was provided by investing activities through the sale of marketable securities  which generated cash of million  offset principally by purchases of property and equipment of  and software development costs of  accounts receivable at december  increased million to million from million at december  the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased revenues and the increased size of the company s contracts which take a longer period to collect 
the company s accounts receivable balance will vary from year to year  depending on the number and size of client projects and on the timing of completion of the projects 
the company has a million line of credit agreement with a commercial bank  which expires on may  and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
borrowings under the credit agreement are limited to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the credit agreement 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings against this agreement 
the company does not intend to renew the credit agreement upon its expiration on may  at december   the company had  of notes payable and capital lease principal payable 
the company used a portion of the net proceeds of its initial public offering to repay  of the long term bank debt and  of short term bank borrowings 
the company believes its cash and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance that additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by the company will not be required nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as required by the company 
additional item 
safe harbor for forward looking statements the company or its representatives from time to time may make or may have made certain forward looking statements  orally or in writing  including without limitations any such statements made or to be made in the management s discussions and analysis contained in its various sec filings 
the company wishes to ensure that such statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements  so as to ensure to the fullest extent possible the protections of the safe harbor established in the private securities litigation reform act of accordingly  such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the following discussion of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the reader that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
the company operates in a continually changing business environment  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
management cannot predict such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact  if any  of such risk factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factors  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 
variability of operating results the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its quarterly results 
the company s revenues are affected by a number of factors  including the timing of the introduction of new d visualization software and interactive software products by the company and its competitors  seasonality of certain customer purchases of interactive software products  product mix  general economic conditions and the company s ability to obtain agreements from publishers and distributors to market the company s interactive software products 
the company s operating results also will vary significantly depending on changes in pricing  changes in customer budgets and the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
eai s interactive software products may experience some effect of seasonality created by the academic school year 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future revenues and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
therefore  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
technological change and market acceptance the company s success depends on its ability to develop and sell new products  develop site licensing agreements with major manufacturers in the automotive  aerospace  heavy equipment and other manufacturing industries  port its d visualization software products to new platforms and continue to produce high quality interactive products in a timely and cost effective manner 
in addition  the company must continually anticipate  and adapt its products to  emerging computer technologies and capabilities  such as enhanced sound  music  video and speech generation 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate because the markets that the company targets are in the early stages of development and because of uncertainties arising from the effect of future product enhancements  future developments in hardware and software technology and future competition 
if the company s products become outdated and lose market share or if new products or existing product upgrades are not introduced when demanded by the market or are not accepted by the market  the company s revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products on a timely basis or that such new products will be accepted in the market 
dependence on emerging market for d visualization software products the market for enterprise wide d visualization software products in the automotive  aerospace  heavy equipment and other manufacturing industries is emerging and dependent on a number of variables  including customer preferences and the rate of adoption of new technology 
there can be no assurance that this market will continue to grow or that the company s d visualization software products will be accepted by the market 
the company s growth is dependent in part on significant demand for its d visualization software products 
in addition  as the company increasingly markets it d visualization software as an enterprise wide solution  there can be no assurance that large customers will be willing to invest in eai s products on a company wide basis or that users outside the design and engineering areas will accept the company s products 
in  sales of d visualization software products to ford motor company and hewlett packard company accounted for and of the company s revenues  respectively 
there can be no assurance that eai will be able to continue to sell d visualization software products to these customers at levels or  if it fails to do so  that the company will be able to replace these customers with new customers 
dependence on emerging market for interactive software products the market for interactive multimedia software products is emerging and dependent on a number of variables  including consumer preferences  shipments of multimedia personal computers  the installed base of multimedia personal computers and the number of other publishers creating interactive software products 
there can be no assurance that this market will continue to grow 
the market for games and educational multimedia software is characterized by rapid changes in computer hardware and software technology and is highly competitive with respect to timely product innovation 
the company s near term growth is dependent in part on significant demand for its recently released interactive software products and for its products under development 
however  the company does not receive royalty revenues from a product until the publisher commences retail sales of the product  which may not occur immediately after delivery of the product to the publisher  if at all 
there can be no assurance that the company s new interactive software products will be accepted by the market or that the company will be able to respond effectively to the evolving requirements of the market 
reliance on third parties to market and distribute interactive software products eai s strategy has been to rely upon third parties to market and distribute its interactive software products 
eai does not have an exclusive relationship with any of the current distributors of its interactive software products 
eai s relationships with sirtech software inc  bmg interactive  times mirror  time warner  elsevier science and others have involved contracts that address a single product or title for a specific market area and do not constitute a continuing marketing and distribution agreement 
there can be no assurance that eai s relationships with such publishers will continue or that the company will be able to find other means to market and distribute its interactive software products 
failure to continue such relationships  establish new relationships or develop independent means of marketing and distributing interactive software products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results 
reliance on third parties to market and distribute certain d visualization software products in addition to marketing the company s d visualization software products directly to end users  eai has contractual relationships with hewlett packard to jointly market and structural dynamics research corp 
sdrc to jointly market and distribute certain of eai s software products 
although these contracts represent a significant marketing and distribution opportunity for the company s software products  there can be no assurance that these contractual relationships will be successful in creating significant sales or that these relationships will be continued at the end of their one year terms 
competition eai expects significant competition in each of its three product lines d visualization software products large computer companies or companies competing in the cad cae cam markets could offer products with the same or similar functionality as offered by vismockup tm and the company s other visualization software products 
such companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than eai  include ibm  parametric technology corp  sdrc  silicon graphics  inc  dassault systemes of america corp  division inc 
and autodesk inc although the company believes it has a technological advantage over potential competitors in these markets  maintaining its advantage will require continuing investment by the company in research and development and sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that such investments will be successful 
interactive software products the interactive software publishing industry is intensely competitive 
the company s sales to the educational and consumer markets may be adversely affected by the increasing number of competitive products 
eai s interactive software products will compete directly against other educational and consumer software products including multi player internet games 
eai s competitors in this area include a large number of companies  some of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than eai  such as broderbund software inc  gt interactive software corp  softkey international inc  digital domain inc 
and cuc international 
moreover  large corporations  such as the walt disney company and microsoft corporation  which have substantial bases of intellectual property content and substantial financial resources  have entered or announced their intention to enter the market for consumer software 
custom animation products while the company believes that most special effects firms target the feature film and advertising markets  these firms could refocus their efforts in the commercial markets  an area in which eai derives most of its custom animation revenue 
these special effects firms  some of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than eai  include dreamworks skg  pixar  industrial light and magic a division of lucasfilm limited and digital domain 
in addition  a large number of small companies provide custom animations to commercial markets as a complement to their primary business of studio film production  engineering consulting and communications consulting 
protection of proprietary rights the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its extensive proprietary technology and databases 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure and non competition agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent the company s competitors from obtaining or using the company s proprietary technology and databases 
certain of the company s products include mechanisms intended to prevent or inhibit unauthorized copying 
in addition  the company packages its visualization software products with license agreements  which prohibit unauthorized copying of such products 
unauthorized copying does  however  occur in the software industry  and if a significant amount of unauthorized copying of the company s products were to occur  the company s revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
the laws of certain countries in which the company s products are or may be distributed do not protect the company s products and proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
furthermore  as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  software developers may increasingly become subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future products  or that any such assertion will not require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
the company s key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
competition for such employees is intense and the process of locating key technical and management personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute the company s strategy can be lengthy 
accordingly  the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the company maintains key person insurance covering certain of its executive officers 
however  the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to offset the company s loss of the services of any of its executive officers 
management of growth the company has experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth which could place a significant strain on the company s employees  operating procedures  financial resources and information systems 
the company plans to introduce a significant number of new products  increase its production capacity and development expenditures  expand its sales and marketing initiatives and hire additional employees 
the company s plans to increase its sales and marketing presence in europe and asia could expose the company to foreign currency fluctuations  foreign labor laws and other unforeseen problems 
such activities will require significant managerial expertise 
if the company is unable to manage its growth effectively  the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
risk of liability claims by customers although the company has not experienced product liability claims by customers  the company could experience such claims in the future 
the company s interactive software products carry a disclaimer that the products should not be used for diagnostic or treatment purposes and are only for educational and medical reference purposes 
the company has general liability insurance and insurance for errors and omissions in the content of its products 
if a liability claim were to be made  there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in defending against the claim or  if unsuccessful  that the amount of insurance coverage  if any  would be sufficient to pay the claim 
share price volatility the trading price of the common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the software and computer industries and other events or factors 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the shares of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
anti takeover provisions the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a non negotiated merger or other business combination involving the company 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the board of directors in connection with the transaction 
certain of these provisions may  however  discourage a future acquisition of the company not approved by the board of directors in which stockholders might receive an attractive value for their shares or that a substantial number or even a majority of the company s stockholders might believe to be in their best interest 
as a result  stockholders who desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
such provisions could also discourage bids for the shares of common stock at a premium  as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of common stock 
such provisions include  among other things  a classified board of directors serving staggered three year terms  the elimination of stockholder voting by consent  a provision providing that only a majority of the board of directors  the chairman or the president can call a special meeting of stockholders  and a provision permitting removal of directors only for cause and only by the holders of at least of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors  voting together as a single class 
in addition to the common stock  the company s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
the company has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock 
however  because the rights and preferences for any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion  the company may issue preferred stock that has rights and preferences superior to the rights of holders of shares of the common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of holders of shares of the common stock 
in addition  the board of directors has adopted a stockholders rights plan that may have an anti takeover effect and may discourage or prevent takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors including takeovers that certain stockholders may deem to be in their best interests 
dividends the company has not paid any dividends and does not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever pay a cash dividend
