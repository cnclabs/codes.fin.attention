item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table contains income and expense items from the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal   and expressed as a percentage of total revenue 
fiscal year total revenue total cost of sales and revenue gross profit margin selling expenses general and administrative expenses research and development expenses  net acquisition related expenses write off of goodwill total operating expenses earnings loss from operations total other expense income earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense net earnings loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues total revenue increased by for fiscal to  compared to fiscal this growth was the result of acquisitions as total sales to semiconductor capital equipment customers were flat due to an industry downturn during the first three quarters of fiscal eto  acquired half way through fiscal  provided most of the growth 
sales of specialty rf power sources for medical applications increased by  in fiscal over the acquisition of cpi  inc  completed on may   added  of revenue in fiscal research contract revenue was approximately of total revenue in both fiscal and other revenue consisting of service  spare parts and repairs increased by to  in fiscal  primarily due to eto which obtains a larger fraction of its total revenues from this category 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit as a percent of total revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to the acquisitions of eto and cpi whose products have lower gross margins than other product lines in the company 
in addition  gross margins were negatively impacted by new product introduction ramp up costs  reduced volumes on existing products  and increased inventory reserves 
the company s goal is to improve future gross margins with the introduction of new products with anticipated higher margins  improved manufacturing efficiencies and methods  and increased sales volumes spread over certain fixed costs 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses decreased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal selling expenses decreased due to the consolidation of the company s semiconductor sales activities and a reduction in headcount  promotional costs  and travel expenses compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by to  in fiscal but decreased as a percent of sales compared to fiscal during fiscal there was an additional six months of eto and two months of cpi general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal despite these additions  cost reduction efforts reduced the overall level of the increase 
research and development net research and development expenses increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal gross spending total research and development spending including funded joint development and the direct costs of research contracts increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increased gross spending resulted in significant design wins during the year  including an integrated chemical plasma source cps for photoresist strip and a new combined rf and microwave subsystem for high density plasma cvd and etch for semiconductor production 
in addition  the company introduced three new products at year end  including astron for chamber clean  solo for wet bench applications  and smartpower  a new line of intelligent microwave generators 
the company is committed to continued investments in research and development in order to advance its position as a market and technological leader 
a valuation process was performed in fiscal in order to establish the fair values of the cpi assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as part of this process  the company incurred an expense of  for cpi s in process research and development 
this compares to acquisition related expenses of  incurred with the acquisitions of eto and nes in fiscal see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of  associated with the eto acquisition 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income operating income was  in fiscal compared to a loss of  in fiscal excluding one time charges for acquisition related expenses and the write off of goodwill  operating income in fiscal would have been  or of total revenue compared to  or of total revenue in fiscal the decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the increased r d investment and lower gross margins in fiscal other expense and income taxes interest expense in fiscal increased by to  compared to  in fiscal  while interest income in fiscal decreased by to  compared to  in fiscal these changes were the result of the use of cash for the acquisitions of eto and cpi  and increased borrowings to fund these acquisitions 
income tax expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal the expected tax computed by applying the us federal corporate income tax rate of to earnings loss before income taxes was increased by  due to one time charges of goodwill amortization and write off and acquisition related expenses which were not tax deductible 
there are no comparable costs in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues total revenue increased by for fiscal to  compared to fiscal of this increase  was due to increased sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  while was due to the acquisition of eto 
increased semiconductor sales were driven by a increase in ozone products and a increase in microwave and plasma products 
research contract revenue decreased in fiscal by or  compared to fiscal while funding used to offset research and development expenses increased by  for a net decline of 
other revenue consisting of service  spare parts and repairs increased by to  in fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of eto which obtains a larger fraction of its total revenue from this category 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or in fiscal compared to fiscal gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of eto whose products have lower gross margins than other product lines in the company 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal  although gross spending increased by due to the addition of eto s selling expenses and to increased personnel in the direct sales and sales support functions  increased consulting and travel and increased promotional expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  although gross spending increased by due to the acquisition of eto and to additional personnel  increased consulting and travel  and increased legal and accounting fees 
research and development net research and development expenses increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal gross spending total research and development spending including funded joint development and the direct cost of research contracts increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increased gross spending was primarily due to a technology development agreement with applied materials and increased new product development  offset by a reduced level of research contract spending 
acquisition related expenses of  were incurred in fiscal associated with the acquisitions of eto and nes 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of  see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no comparable expenses in fiscal operating income the company incurred an operating loss of  in fiscal compared to an operating profit of  in fiscal excluding one time charges associated with the eto acquisition acquisition related costs and non recurring goodwill write off operating income would have been a record profit of  of sales or an increase of compared to fiscal other expense and income taxes interest expense increased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal  while interest income decreased  all driven primarily by bank borrowing and cash used for the acquisition of eto 
the net effect was a decline in other income to  in fiscal income tax expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal the expected tax computed by applying the us federal corporate income tax rate of to earnings loss before income taxes was increased by  due to one time charges of goodwill amortization and write off and acquisition related expenses which were not tax deductible 
there were no comparable costs in fiscal foreign currency fluctuations the company s foreign revenues are generally denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
over time  as the company seeks to expand its operations in europe and the far east  more revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies  increasing the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources at fiscal year end the company had cash and long term investments of  with working capital of  compared to fiscal when the company had cash and short term investments of  and working capital of  footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of recent acquisitions completed by the company 
these include cpi in may   eto in january   and nes in november  in november  the company completed an ipo and received net proceeds of  through the sale of  shares of common stock and  five year redeemable warrants at prices of per share and per warrant 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the common stock and redeemable warrants are traded on nasdaq nms under the symbols astx and astxw  respectively 
the redeemable warrants are subject to redemption at per warrant on days prior notice  provided that the average closing price of the company s common stock equals or exceeds for consecutive trading days 
on september   the company announced that it had met this requirement and would call the warrants for redemption 
if all the warrants are exercised  this would provide additional equity financing of approximately million for the company 
these funds would be used to reduce bank debt and for general working capital purposes 
the company also issued to the underwriter of the ipo  for nominal consideration  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and  redeemable warrants

in october the company purchased  of series a convertible preferred stock of low entropy systems  inc les 
in august   the company sold all of its shares of les to balzers and leybold us holding  inc for  during fiscal  the company generated  in net cash flows from operating activities and used a net  for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities consisted of  for the acquisition of cpi   for additions to property  equipment  and patents  and  for the purchase of investments  offset by sales of  in investments 
investments are primarily commercial paper and government treasury bills 
the company s cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of notes payable of  offset by note repayments of  and proceeds of  from issuance of common stock which was primarily due to exercise of employee stock options 
the proceeds of notes payable were a result of additional borrowings for the acquisition of cpi  while the repayments were primarily a result of debt restructuring for the acquisition 
during fiscal  the company generated  in net cash flows from operating activities and used a net  for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities consisted of  for acquisition of eto less cash acquired with the acquisitions of eto and nes   for additions to property  equipment  and patents   for an equity investment in les  and  for the purchase of investments  offset by sales of  in investments 
investments are primarily commercial paper and government treasury bills 
the company s cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of two notes payable for  used in the acquisition of eto offset by  of note repayments see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and  from issuance of common stock which was primarily due to exercise of investor warrants and exercise of employee stock options 
during fiscal the company generated  in net cash flows from operating activities and used a net  for investing activities  primarily for the purchase of  of investments and  in additions to property  equipment  and patents  offset by sales of  of investments 
the company used  for financing activities  primarily for a stock repurchase program under which  shares were repurchased for  at an average price of per share 
the stock repurchase program objective was to support the stock price in the open market 
all treasury stock held was retired on july  the board of directors has not terminated the stock repurchase program  but no shares have been purchased since march  the company has a credit facility with state street bank and trust company which consists of an  unsecured demand line of credit for working capital purposes  with interest at the bank s prime rate 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit at june  and as of the date of this report 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this facility is subject to the company meeting certain financial covenants which are tested quarterly 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants 
in addition  the company has made certain negative pledges against selling assets without the bank s consent 
the company continues to use its cash resources for developing new products  expanding sales and marketing  performing collaborative product development projects  and for general working capital 
the company continues to seek joint ventures and or acquisitions that will enhance the company s position in its markets the potential to increase revenue growth and profitability 
the company has entered into a binding purchase agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of a german company  which is expected to close within the next month 
the purchase price of approximately million is to be paid in cash at closing  subject to adjustment 
the company has adequate financial resources to complete this acquisition within its existing credit facilities 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that existing cash resources  investments  anticipated cash flows from operations and its credit facility will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses and working capital requirements for a period of at least the next months 
the company may seek to raise additional capital for acquisitions and for other corporate purposes  although no specific financing is planned at this time  other than the funds raised by the announcement to redeem all of the company s unexercised redeemable warrants 
new accounting pronouncements in fiscal and  the company will be required to adopt several new accounting pronouncements

factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated operating expense levels  gross margin estimates and the availability of funds to meet cash requirements may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
customer concentration relatively few customers account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
sales to the company s ten largest customers in fiscal years   and accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal years   and  sales to applied materials  the company s largest customer in each of these periods  accounted for approximately   and of the company s revenues  respectively 
the company expects that sales to applied materials will continue to represent a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future  although the acquisitions of eto and cpi are expected to provide some reduction on the reliance on applied materials 
although a number of the company s customers do enter into long term supply agreements  these agreements typically allow the customer to cancel orders with limited penalties 
a reduction or delay in orders from applied materials or other significant customers  including reductions or delays due to market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry  could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
dependence on cyclical industries the company s business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and historically has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demands for capital equipment  including the products manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results may be materially adversely affected by semiconductor industry downturns or slowdowns 
reliance on oem customers  lengthy sales cycle the company s products are principally sold to oems which incorporate the company s products into their equipment 
due to the significant capital commitments usually incurred by semiconductor manufacturers in their purchase of the oem s equipment  these manufacturers demand highly reliable products which require as long as several years for oems to develop 
the company s revenues are therefore primarily dependent upon the timing and effectiveness of the efforts of its oem customers in developing and marketing equipment incorporating the company s products 
there can be no assurance that any equipment incorporating the company s products will be marketed successfully by the company s customers

japanese market the japanese semiconductor equipment markets are large and difficult for foreign companies to penetrate 
the company believes that increasing its penetration of the japanese market is important to its business  and that it is currently at a competitive disadvantage to japanese suppliers  many of which have long standing collaborative relationships with japanese semiconductor process equipment manufacturers 
moreover  the company s ability to compete effectively in the japanese market may be limited by the company s size and its geographic location 
although the company intends to expand its direct presence in japan  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve significant sales to  or compete successfully in  japan

foreign revenues the company does business worldwide  both directly and via sales to united states based oems who sell such products internationally 
in fiscal  and  foreign revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
the company anticipates that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenues  which will result in a significant portion of the company s revenues and operating results being subject to risks associated with foreign revenues  including united states and foreign regulatory and policy changes  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing representatives  and foreign currency fluctuations 
see business marketing and sales 
highly competitive industry the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
a number of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selling its products to oems  regardless of the performance or the price of the company s products 
competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
other technical innovations may impair the company s ability to market its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
see business competition 
new products and technological change the semiconductor manufacturing industry has been characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
the company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop new products to meet customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in introducing products or product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will be able to market successfully these products and product enhancements once developed 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete by new industry standards or changing technology 
see business research and development 
management of growth the company has recently gone through a period of rapid growth 
due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support its existing and new customers  the company must attract highly qualified and well trained personnel 
there can be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
the company s expansion may also significantly strain the company s management  manufacturing  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support the company s operations 
failure to manage the company s growth properly could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results and market price of securities the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on factors such as economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  the timing of significant orders and shipments of its products  changes and delays in product development  new product introductions by the company and its competitors  the mix of products sold by the company and competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  a number of the company s microwave plasma processing and diamond deposition systems have high selling prices 
as a result  quarterly variations in systems sales could significantly affect the company s operating results 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments and production difficulties could delay shipments 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
the market price of the company s securities could also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  and market conditions in the semiconductor industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company 
effects of inflation the company believes that  over the past three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or operating results
