overview the company designs and manufactures occupant safety systems and devices engineered to safeguard human life in a wide range of air  ground  and sea transportation vehicles 
utilizing its substantial proprietary technology in energy absorbing seating  inflatable restraints  and composite materials  the company focuses on reducing injury and increasing survivability in vehicle crashes 
the company s historic core business has been as a government contractor 
additionally  through recent acquisitions  the company has become the largest north american based supplier of seating systems for rail and other mass transit vehicles and a successful new entrant in the manufacture of new commercial airliner seating 
utilizing its proprietary safety technology  customer relationships  and manufacturing capacity expertise  recently enhanced through acquisitions  the company has introduced crashworthy seating systems for a variety of aircraft  various inflatable restraint systems for automobiles  a bulkhead airbag system for commercial airliners  and two cockpit inflatable restraint systems for military aircraft 
in  management made a strategic decision to enter the commercial aircraft seating market to bring its proprietary energy absorbing technologies to a new industry and take advantage of positive industry trends 
to implement its decision the company completed three acquisitions that allowed it to develop the necessary infrastructure to support future growth 
in august  the company acquired airline interiors  inc the airline acquisition  which was primarily involved with the refurbishment  reupholstery  reconditioning  and reconfiguring of existing passenger seats 
the airline acquisition provided certain faa certifications  enhanced the company s management team and customer base  and provided substantial assembly capacity 
during  the company acquired coach car equipment corporation coach and car and artcraft industries corp 
artcraft 
the acquisitions of coach and car and artcraft are collectively referred to as the acquisitions 
the acquisitions existing operations included providing a majority of all manufacturing and refurbishment of rail and mass transit seating systems in north america 
the acquisitions also provided the company with substantial large scale manufacturing capacity and synergies  which will be utilized in the production of its g seat for airliners 
the company has taken advantage of the synergies between these three entities in the manufacture of rail and mass transit seating systems 
the full strategic value of these businesses will not be realized until the company begins large scale manufacturing of its g seat 
as a result of the size and timing of its acquisitions  the financial statements for the years   and may not be directly comparable 
simula s revenue has historically been derived from three sources sales of company manufactured products  contract research and development for third parties  and  technology sales and royalties 
a substantial portion of its current revenue is accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recorded as production progresses so that revenue less costs incurred to date yields the percentage of gross margin estimated for each contract 
overall gross margin percentages can increase or decrease based upon changes in estimated gross margin percentages over the lives of individual contracts 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides a break down of revenues for each significant segment of the company 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides the revenues and related costs associated with contract research and development for third parties 
the company is a holding company for wholly owned subsidiaries  including simula government products  inc  the principal entity conducting the company s government and defense business  and simula transportation equipment corporation simtec formerly known as intaero  an entity conducting the company s commercial seating businesses 
other includes general corporate operations and subsidiaries engaged in technology development including simula automotive safety devices  inc simula asd which was established in and conducts substantially all of the company s operations encompassing inflatable restraints for automobiles 
through  simula asd has not had significant revenue

year ended december  income statement data revenue cost of revenue gross margin administrative expenses unusual item operating loss income during the second quarter of  the company adopted a new method of accounting for pre contract costs as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
beginning in  the company now expenses these pre contract costs as incurred rather than deferring these costs to be amortized over the revenue streams from the company s customers 
this change resulted in a cumulative catch up adjustment for the effect of costs capitalized as of december  the effect of the change on the year ended december  was to increase cost of revenue by million  resulting in an increase in the loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
per share net of the related income tax benefit 
in addition  net income for year ended december  was reduced by million 
per share for the cumulative effect on prior years to december  of changing accounting for pre contract costs 
assuming the change in accounting had been applied retroactively to the year ended december   cost of revenue would have increased million to million and gross margins would have decreased from to 
compared to revenue for the year ended december  increased to million from million in government and defense revenue increased  or million as a result of increased contract activity principally resulting from an armor contract completed during the second quarter of and funded research and development 
simtec revenue increased  or million  primarily as a result of increased deliveries of the g seats 
other revenue decreased principally as a result of a reduction of technology sales and royalties which approximated million in gross margin for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for as a percent of sales  gross margin decreased to from 
the effect of expensing pre contract costs increased cost of revenue million for the year ended december  excluding the effect of expensing pre contract costs  the gross margin percentage for would have been 
gross margin percentages of government and defense in decreased to from 
the decrease in gross margin percentage at government and defense was primarily due to the expensing of pre contract costs principally related to the bulkhead airbag babs which is anticipated to begin deliveries in  funding deficiencies incurred on funded research and development contracts which typically result in follow on production contracts in future years  and a decrease in royalties 
the gross margin percentage at simtec decreased to from in the decrease in gross margin percentage at simtec was primarily due to the expensing of pre contract costs principally related to the g seat  including the related new composite seat back  high material costs related to the low volume production of the g seat  reduced throughput at coach car as it was repositioned to begin high volume manufacturing of g seat components  and lower individual gross margin percentages from the mix of contracts in process or completed during the year at coach car and artcraft 
the negative gross margins of the other category was primarily due to the expensing of pre contract costs for the inflatable tubular structure its and certain start up costs related to the production facilities in arizona and the united kingdom which are not anticipated to begin production until march administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for as a percent of sales  administrative expenses increased to from 
research and development expenses increased to million from million as a result of the company s increased investment in several products and developmental subsidiaries that are expected to begin generating revenue subsequent to government and defense administrative expenses increased or million primarily as a result of increased activity and increased research and development 
simtec s administrative expenses increased or million  primarily as a result of the corporate and sales infrastructure necessary to support the anticipated increase in activity related to the g seat 
other administrative expenses decreased or approximately  primarily as a result of the elimination or reduction of the supporting operations for certain technologies 
for the year ended december   the company incurred an operating loss of million compared to operating income of million in the reduction in operating income resulted primarily from the reduction in gross margins and increased administrative expenses noted above 
excluding the effect of expensing pre contract costs during  the operating loss would have been million 
this loss is primarily due to the start up costs of the its manufacturing facilities in phoenix  arizona and the united kingdom and g seat manufacturing facilities in san diego  california and chicago  illinois  losses arising from research and development contracts for which the company anticipates profitable follow on contracts  increased research and development and the expenses of the administrative and sales infrastructure that will be necessary in to support manufacturing and the generation of sales of the its and g seat 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in this increase is due to increased borrowings on the company s bank credit facilities and the issuance of million of series c senior subordinated convertible notes the notes in a private placement to accredited investors in september these borrowings were made to fund the growth in working capital and fixed assets necessary to support the anticipated growth in revenues in the effective income tax rate approximated the statutory rate of in for  the effective income tax rate was disproportionate at primarily due to the realization of tax attributes of an acquired subsidiary 
the effects of the tax attributes of this acquired subsidiary were substantially recognized in compared to revenue for the year ended december  increased to million from million in government and defense increased  or million as a result of increased contract activity including increases in funded research and development 
simtec revenue increased  or million  primarily as a result of the full year inclusion of the acquisitions and the initial delivery of the g seats 
other revenue increased principally as a result of technology sales and royalties of approximately million in gross margin for the year ended december  increased to million from in the increase is attributable to increased revenue noted above 
as a percent of sales  gross margin increased to from 
gross margin percentages of government and defense in decreased to from 
the gross margin percentage at simtec decreased to from in the decrease for simtec resulted from million in losses recorded on contracts which were acquired in the acquisition of artcraft 
these losses were substantially offset by the full integration of the acquisitions  which allowed the company to increase its vertical integration  thereby eliminating several third party vendors 
these benefits were offset to a certain extent by the acceleration of two low margin contracts that were committed to by coach and car prior to its acquisition by the company 
the gross margin percentage of the other category increased to from a negative margin of in as a result of the technology sales and royalties 
administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the comparable periods in as a percent of sales  administrative expenses increased to from 
research and development expenses increased to million from approximately  as a result of the company s increased investment in several products and developmental subsidiaries that are expected to begin generating revenue subsequent to depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million from million  primarily as a result of amortization relating to the acquisitions 
government and defense administrative expenses increased or million  primarily as a result of increased activity and increased research and development 
simtec s administrative expenses increased or million  primarily as a result of the inclusion of the acquired companies for the entire period and the expansion of the corporate and sales infrastructure necessary to support the anticipated increase in activity related to the g seat 
other administrative expenses increased or million  primarily as a result of an increased investment in personnel and operations of the company s developmental subsidiaries 
operating income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the comparable period in operating income decreased primarily due to the recording of losses on the contracts at artcraft and increased administrative costs 
these costs were substantially offset by the increased gross margins resulting from increased revenue 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased by approximately  over the comparable period in as a result of a higher average debt balance in additional debt was incurred to finance working capital requirements and assumed in connection with the acquisitions 
approximately million of debt was retired in the second quarter of with a portion of the proceeds of the company s public offering 
the effective income tax rate was approximately for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate in is attributable to the realization of tax attributes of an acquired subsidiary 
the effects of the tax attributes of this acquired subsidiary were substantially recognized in accordingly  management does not expect that the remaining tax attributes will have a significant impact on the company s effective income tax rate in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations through operating cash flow  lines of credit and debt and equity offerings 
in august  the company began to acquire companies  primarily with borrowed funds 
the company issued million of senior subordinated notes the notes in connection with the acquisition of airline interiors in august  the company issued approximately million of senior subordinated convertible notes the notes in connection with the acquisition of coach and car in june  and the company issued common stock and assumed a bank line of credit of million  of which  was repaid simultaneously with the closing  in connection with the acquisition of artcraft in september but for the acquisitions  the company would have been able to satisfy its financial needs through operating cash flow 
these acquisitions resulted in substantially increased working capital needs to fund the large vendor payable balances  contract advances of coach and car existing at the date of acquisition  and the increase in receivables and inventories of all the acquired companies after the respective dates of acquisition 
in addition  restrictive covenants under the company s then existing bank line of credit required the company to seek alternative financing 
in september  prior to the closing of the artcraft acquisition  the company obtained an aggregate of million of financing from three non bank lenders  including million from the company s chairman 
the notes were converted into common stock during the company completed a public offering of common stock  which closed and funded in april as a result of this offering   shares were sold by the company at per share 
approximately million of indebtedness was repaid at that time  including the million described above 
in september  the company issued million of the notes in a private placement to accredited investors 
the notes bear interest at payable semi annually and are due in september at the date of issuance  the notes were convertible into common stock of the company at of the average closing price of the company s common stock as quoted on the new york stock exchange for the consecutive trading days immediately preceding notice by the individual holder fixing the conversion price 
based upon the conversion prices fixed prior to december  and the average market price of the company s common stock for the days ended december  for the notes not yet fixed  the notes would be convertible into approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
at the date of issuance  the company had the right to call the notes at par plus accrued interest through the date of redemption any time after june  and earlier under certain circumstances 
the indenture relating to the notes and the company s senior subordinated notes  contains certain covenants including limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  limitation on sale of assets  transactions with affiliates  and restricted dividend payments 
in accordance with the indenture  the company may incur indebtedness based upon the specified ratio of cash flow  as defined  to interest expense 
all of the company s borrowings  including the availability under the company s line of credit are allowable borrowings under the terms of the indenture 
the company was in compliance with all covenants of the indenture at december  subsequent to december   the company undertook to obtain the consent of the holders of the notes and the notes to amend the indenture to eliminate the covenants limiting the incurrence of additional indebtedness and making certain dividend payments  to allow the company greater flexibility with future financings consistent with the company s growth 
consistent with the procedures under the indenture  effective march   the company obtained the consent of in excess of the majority of the principal amount of such notes and by act of the company and the trustee under the indenture  the amendments eliminating these covenants were adopted 
in consideration for the consent of the holders of the notes  the notes were amended to change the conversion ratio from to or reduce the conversion price for the notes previously fixed by 
per share 
in addition  the company s optional redemption date was extended from june  to december  and certain fees to be paid to the holders of the notes were eliminated 
based on the revised terms of the notes and the average market price of the company s common stock for the days ended december   the notes would be convertible into approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
in  the company entered into a modification of its existing loan agreement with wells fargo bank  na this modification provided for an increase in the existing revolving line of credit to million and million of availability for equipment purchases 
the modified agreement contains a covenant that limits the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness 
specifically  the modified agreement allows the company to incur up to million of subordinated debt  a foreign loan facility of million  computer equipment financing and certain refinancing indebtedness 
in addition  the modified agreement contains certain covenants that require the maintenance of various financial ratios  including minimum tangible net worth  as defined  of million  a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum current ratio of to and a minimum debt coverage ratio 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the company s liquidity is greatly impacted by the nature of the billing provisions under its government contracts 
generally  in the early period of contracts  cash expenditures and accrued profits are greater than allowed billings while contract completion results in billing previously unbilled costs and profits 
contract receivables increased million for the year ended december  principally due to the timing of billings  increased volume at coach and car the reduction of advances on contracts at coach and car and artcraft 
operating activities required the use of million of cash during the year ended december   compared to the use of million of cash during this resulted primarily from significant investment in research and development expenses  pre contract costs and plant start up costs  including the associated general and administrative costs  all of which have been expensed  for products the company will not begin to ship in substantial quantities until  the working capital required for the reduction in advances on contracts noted above and the funding of the million investment in inventories primarily at simtec and government and defense 
the increase in inventories at simtec primarily represents the buildup necessary to support anticipated future deliveries of the g seat 
the increase in inventories at government and defense represents inventory necessary to support certain programs which require the buildup of components necessary to support rapid deliveries of various configurations of seats 
in addition  both simtec and government and defense have purchased inventory in larger quantities to reduce per unit costs 
investing activities required the use of million of cash during the year ended december  primarily for the purchase of equipment for the company s new its manufacturing facilities in phoenix  arizona and the united kingdom  manufacturing equipment for the g seat and computer and test equipment at government and defense 
for  cash used by investing activities was million and was expended primarily for the acquisition of property and equipment 
financing activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   of which million resulted from borrowings on the revolving credit facility primarily for working capital needs and million resulted from borrowings on the equipment credit facility for the financing of fixed assets 
in addition  the company issued the notes in september cash provided by financing activities for was million and primarily resulted from the sale of the company s stock for million offset by the net reduction of borrowings of million 
included in current portion of long term debt is a mortgage of million on one of the company s facilities that is due in march the company is currently pursuing various alternatives for this property and believes it will be able to repay or refinance the mortgage on a long term basis prior to its maturity 
the company believes it has sufficient manufacturing capacity  at december   to meet its estimated delivery requirements 
the company anticipates cash provided by operating activities and the availability under its bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its current working capital requirements 
however  to fund purchases of property and equipment and future working capital requirements necessary to address the anticipated growth of demand and markets for its new technologies and products  the company will look to obtain additional capital 
the modification to the indenture noted above will allow the company more flexibility in pursuing financing alternatives 
the raising of additional capital in public markets will be primarily dependent upon prevailing market conditions and the demand for the company s technologies and products 
in relation to this  the company filed a registration statement on october  for  shares of convertible preferred stock 
the terms  conditions  preferences and pricing of the convertible preferred stock will depend on market conditions and have not been set 
this filing was made to enable the company to more efficiently and timely pursue public capital sources should the market become favorable 
the proceeds to be raised will be used to establish new and expand existing manufacturing facilities  primarily for the manufacture of aircraft and rail seating systems and components related to the company s automobile inflatable restraint systems  working capital requirements attendant to growth in markets and revenues and other general corporate purposes  including potential future acquisitions 
in the event the company does not complete the preferred stock offering  and it has capital requirements  the company may look to bank lines of credit  equipment financing arrangements  and private offerings of debt or equity securities 
inflation the company does not believe that it is significantly impacted by inflation 
research and development the company s research and development occurs primarily under fixed price  government funded contracts as well as company sponsored efforts 
the revenue received under government funded contracts is recorded under the percentage completion method of accounting  and the costs of independent research and development efforts are expensed as incurred 
historically  research and development efforts have fluctuated based upon available government funded contracts 
the company anticipates that future fluctuations may also occur and that absent government funded research  the company will directly fund research and development efforts to expand its inflatable restraint  commercial airliner seating  and rail seating technologies 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s costs for research and development to advance its technologies were million in seasonality the company s operations and financial results are affected by the seasonal variations in deliveries by suppliers 
historically  the company has experienced its highest level of deliveries of materials in the fourth quarter and its lowest level of deliveries in the first quarter 
accordingly  for those contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  the company has historically recorded its highest revenue in the fourth quarter and lower revenue in the first quarter 
forward looking information and risks of the business the company expects that during fiscal  it will complete roll out and enter large scale production of new products  including  its  cabs  babs  ibahrs  and g airliner seats 
the company expects that in late and in  it will begin to realize significant revenues from the introduction of these products 
the other core businesses of the company are expected to remain at current revenue and profit levels 
projected operating results and capital needs will be affected by a wide variety of factors which could adversely impact revenues  profitability and cash flows  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the factors include the company s ability to design and introduce new products on a timely basis  market acceptance and demand of both the company s and its customers products  success in building strategic alliances with large prime contractors and first tier suppliers  the level of orders which are received and can be shipped and invoiced in a quarter  customer order patterns and seasonality  levels of accounts receivable  changes in product mix  product performance and reliability  product obsolescence  availability and utilization of manufacturing capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yield  the availability and cost of raw materials  equipment  and other supplies  the cyclical nature of the airline  rail and automobile industries and other markets addressed by the company s products  the level and makeup of military expenditures  technological changes  competition and competitive pressures on pricing  and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide markets served by the company 
the company s products are incorporated into a variety of transportation vehicles 
a slowdown in demand for new transportation vehicles or modifications services to transportation vehicles as a result of economic or other conditions in the united states or worldwide markets served by the company and its customers or other broad based factors could adversely affect the company s operating results or financial condition
