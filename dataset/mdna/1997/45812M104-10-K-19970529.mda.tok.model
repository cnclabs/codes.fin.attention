see business risk factors acquisition related risks 
forward looking information is subject to risk and uncertainty except for the historical statements contained herein  this form k contains forward looking statements and information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of that involve risk and uncertainty  including expectations for fiscal and various business environment and trends 
actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  the mix of and changes in distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  the timing and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  changes in pricing  buyouts of run time licenses  product life cycles  the level of the company s sales of third party products  purchasing patterns of distributors and customers  competitive conditions in the industry  business cycles affecting the markets in which the company s products are sold  extraordinary events  such as litigation or acquisitions  including related charges  and economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas 
all of the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast 
the future operating results of the company may fluctuate as a result of these and the other risk factors detailed from time to time in the company s securities and exchange commission reports and in the section of this annual report entitled business risk factors 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
during the last fiscal year  the company s actual performance did not meet market expectations 
it is likely that  in some future quarters  the company s operating results will again be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors

the company s total revenue increased from fiscal year to fiscal year  or from million to million  and from fiscal year to fiscal year to million 
a majority of the company s total revenue came from product revenue  which increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and an additional to million in fiscal year the increase in product revenue from fiscal years to was primarily due to increased unit shipments of psosystem and matrixx and the inclusion of sniff product revenue in fiscal year product revenue increased from fiscal year to fiscal year as unit shipments of psosystem and sniff continued to increase in all geographic regions 
in addition  fiscal year product revenue includes revenues from product sales of epilogue technology corporation  which was acquired in july matrixx revenue was flat from fiscal year to fiscal year services revenue increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year as a result of increases in the number and size of consulting contracts and increases in maintenance revenue from the company s growing installed base of customers 
services revenue increased from fiscal year to fiscal year to million 
the decrease in the rate of services revenue growth in fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year growth rate  was due to a decrease in some of the company s consulting activities 
the percentage of the company s total revenue from customers located internationally was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in europe and japan  revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in local currencies 
in fiscal year  the us dollar strengthened significantly against the major european currencies and the japanese yen  which resulted in lower revenues and expenses when translated into us dollars  as compared to prior years 
in fiscal years and revenues were less influenced by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company s operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
costs and expenses 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was   and in fiscal years  and  respectively

in addition  fiscal year product revenue has a smaller proportion of lower margin hardware revenue than in fiscal year the company s cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue was   and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
fluctuations in these percentages result from shifts in the services revenue mix between higher margin maintenance revenue and lower margin consulting contract revenue 
marketing and sales expenses in fiscal years  and  were  and  respectively  of total revenue 
the percentage decrease from fiscal year to fiscal year was the result of pooling the operating results of several acquired companies whose marketing and sales expenses had represented a smaller percentage of their total revenue 
the percentage increase from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to additional expenses associated with the company s continued expansion of its marketing and sales organization both domestically and internationally  as well as increased marketing activity associated with new product introductions
