the clinical laboratory industry  which includes both clinical chemistry and anatomic pathology  has seen steady downward pressure on prices exerted by both government and private third party payors 
also  payment for services such as those provided by the company is and likely will continue to be affected by periodic reevaluations made by payors concerning which services to reimburse and which to cease reimbursing 
the reduction in reimbursement rates  particularly by medicare  has generally decreased the average unit price for most of the company s clinical chemistry services each year 
in keeping with this trend  as part of obra  congress reduced over time the national cap on medicare laboratory fee schedules 
this national cap has been lowered each year and now is of the national median 
obra also eliminated the annual updates of medicare laboratory fee schedules for the years and in  however  the fee schedule update was  the hcfa has recently announced that the fee schedule update for will be 
however  the corresponding expected national cap increase of may not be fully realized due to a recalculation of national medians necessitated by conversion in some carrier areas to a single statewide fee schedule 
with respect to the company s tissue testing services which are not reimbursed under the medicare laboratory fee schedules  the medicare fees for these services also generally declined with the implementation of the rbrvs system which went into effect in and was fully phased in by the end of the medicare rbrvs payment for each service is calculated by multiplying the total rvu s established for the service by a conversion factor that is set by law 
the number of rvu s assigned to each service is in turn calculated by adding three separate components  including one representing the relative work values 
in  hcfa completed a five year review of the work value component and  as a result  revised the work value amount assigned to many physician services 
in addition  based on a default formula established in law  the conversion factor for nonsurgical services dropped from to per conversion factor 
the changes resulting from the five year review  combined with the conversion factor reductions  resulted in an overall decrease in payments for pathology services of approximately beginning january  also  hcfa reduced the number of physician fee schedule payment localities from to  effective january  connecticut was one of the states that hcfa moved to a single payment locality 
this modification created a decrease in the rbrvs geographic adjustment factor for physicians located in eastern connecticut  where the company s primary operations are located 
in the past  implementation of the rbrvs program has had the effect of reducing prices  and thus the gross profit  of the company 
the recent substantial rbrvs adjustments are likely to continue this trend 
furthermore  as a result of the social security act amendments of  medicare is required to revise the formula for calculating the practice expense component of the physicians medicare fee schedule from the current historical basis to a resource basis beginning january  some concern has been expressed by physician specialty groups that this data hcfa plans to use for these revisions is not adequate and that the agency s methodology could result in specialty practice expenses being underestimated 
at this point  hcfa is considering a variety of options for calculating practice expense revisions 
it is possible that certain changes hcfa might make would have a significant negative affect on reimbursement  and thus gross profit  for anatomic pathology services 
practice expenses currently account for approximately of the physicians medicare fee schedule payment amount 
any future changes in government and other third party payor reimbursement which may come about as a consequence of an enactment of health care reform or of deficit reduction legislation also likely will continue the downward pressure on prices and make the market for clinical laboratory services more competitive 
changes in government reimbursed medicare  as previously described in the reimbursement section are possible this year 
because of the uncertainties about the exact nature of any changes which may ultimately be adopted  however  the company currently is unable to predict their ultimate impact on the clinical laboratory industry generally or on the company in particular 
even apart from federal legislative action  reforms may occur at the state level and changes are occurring in the marketplace as a result of market pressures  including the increasing number of patients covered by some form of managed care 
in the past  the company has offset a substantial portion of the impact of price decreases and coverage changes through the achievement of economies of scale and other strategies such as more favorable purchase contracts and the introduction of alternative technologies 
however  if price decreases for example arising from the proposed medicare changes discussed above or coverage changes were to be rapidly and fully implemented  they would be likely to have an adverse impact on gross profits from the company s testing services until management was able to mitigate such impact 
furthermore  in recent years the company s gross profit margin has trended down from over to about  and there can be no assurances that such trends may not continue
