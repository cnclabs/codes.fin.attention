item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
healthcare healthcare sales were years ended june  in millions net sales imaging agents critical care products pharmaceutical specialties healthcare products are instrumental in the delivery of healthcare services and are sold to hospitals  clinical laboratories  pharmaceutical manufacturers and other customers on a worldwide basis 
healthcare products are related by a high degree of innovation and technology  by regulation from agencies such as the us food and drug administration fda  industry standards and by markets served 
they are significantly affected by conditions within the healthcare industry  including continuing legislative initiatives and public and private healthcare insurance and reimbursement programs 
an aging population and demand for technologically superior products to improve the quality of life while lowering the cost of care are two major factors fueling growth within the industry 
the healthcare industry is experiencing a period of extensive change 
all markets served by the company are highly competitive in the united states and overseas 
legislative bodies  in all likelihood  will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies  and ongoing public debate of these issues can be expected 
cost containment initiatives  market pressures and proposed changes in applicable laws and regulations may have a dramatic effect on pricing or potential demand for medical products  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and third party payors 
in particular  the industry is experiencing market driven reforms from forces within the industry that are exerting pressure on healthcare companies to reduce healthcare costs 
these market driven reforms are resulting in industry wide consolidation that is expected to increase the downward pressure on healthcare product margins  as larger buyer and supplier groups exert pricing pressure on providers of medical devices and other healthcare products 
managed care and other healthcare provider organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population in the united states that receives medical benefits through such organizations and in terms of the influence and control that they are able to exert over an increasingly large portion of the healthcare industry 
these organizations are continuing to consolidate and grow  which may increase the ability of the organizations to influence the practices and pricing involved in the purchase of medical products  including those products sold by the company 
both short term and long term cost containment pressures  as well as the possibility of regulatory reform  may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
on july   mallinckrodt began supplying premier  inc premier  the largest healthcare alliance in the us  with x ray contrast media under a five year contract  an agreement believed to be the largest contract ever written for contrast media products 
subsequently  mallinckrodt entered into sole source agreements to supply premier member hospitals with tracheostomy tubes  temperature monitoring systems  and radiopharmaceuticals and related products 
effective july   premier named mallinckrodt a corporate partner  extending all supply agreements to seven years 
as a corporate partner  mallinckrodt s products will be used preferentially by premier s  member hospitals 
healthcare provides advanced  innovative products for radiology  cardiology  nuclear medicine  anesthesiology  critical care and therapeutic pharmaceuticals 
principal products of this industry segment are contrast media for various imaging modalities  radiopharmaceuticals for medical diagnostic procedures  disposable medical devices  drug chemicals  high purity process chemicals and peptides

customers will benefit from the combined companies expanded product lines and strengthened position as a full service  single source for hospitals and national and regional purchasing organizations 
during  mallinckrodt conducted studies to develop strategies to effectively respond to healthcare customer needs and compete in a market that is changing rapidly as the result of healthcare reform 
as a result of these efforts  in the fourth quarter of mallinckrodt recorded a charge of million  million after taxes  related to implementing organization and process changes 
the key components of the charge included the reorganization of the medical specialty oriented us sales structure into a unified organization divided into geographical districts  reorganization to reduce  centralize and standardize certain non sales related functions and management processes  and manufacturing rationalization 
the process of reorganizing the us sales force addressed new alliances being created on a market by market basis and the changing dynamics of existing customers decision making processes 
sales organizations for imaging agents and critical care products were consolidated into one team to increase responsiveness to the customer 
the consolidation also created geographic regions to improve planning and strategy development on a local basis 
emphasis continues to be placed on contact with the clinical community within its customer base  however  the sales structure provides a single point of contact with each purchasing entity  providing quicker  more efficient and more effective customer service 
pretax cash expenditures for this restructuring approximate the original estimate of million  consisting of million for severance costs for about people at various locations around the world  million for consulting  million for manufacturing rationalization and million for other items 
the million noncash pretax portion of the charge primarily related to manufacturing rationalization

on october   mbi submitted a premarket approval application to the fda s center for devices and radiologic health cdrh for optison 
in february  optison received unconditional recommendation for approval from the cdrh advisory panel of the fda 
then as a result of a citizens petition and subsequent court request  the fda reconsidered whether optison should continue to be reviewed as a device while other ultrasound contrast agents were regulated as drugs 
on july   the fda decided that all ultrasound contrast agents are drugs  not medical devices 
therefore  the optison premarket approval application to the cdrh was transferred to the center for drug evaluation and research cder 
the fda s decision does not affect the marketing of albunex 
the cder will be able to rely  as appropriate  on the extensive analysis already done by the cdrh  the comments and recommendations of the february advisory panel  and any conclusions already reached by the cdrh 
mbi will be expected to amend its new drug application nda with the appropriate patient information  proposed drug labeling and other information needed to support the approval of an nda

environmental matters the company is subject to various environmental protection and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the united states and foreign countries in which it operates 
in addition  the company has handled  and will continue to deal in or otherwise handle  materials and wastes classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies 
significant capital expenditures  as well as operating costs  have been incurred to comply with the laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment  occupational safety and health  and the handling of hazardous materials 
there are inherent and unquantifiable risks in handling hazardous or toxic materials and wastes 
on the basis of its best information  the company does not believe the expenditures and risks occasioned by these circumstances have as yet become materially adverse to its financial condition or results of operations  however  no assurance can be given that this will continue to be true 
in particular  the company is unable to predict the extent to which it may be adversely affected by future regulatory developments such as new or changed laws or regulations 
most of the company s environmental related capital expenditures are in response to provisions of the federal clean air act  water pollution control act  resource conservation and recovery act  comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  and land use  air and water protection regulations of the various localities and states  and their foreign counterparts 
capital expenditures worldwide relating to air emission control  wastewater purification  land reclamation and solid waste disposal totaled approximately million in and million in the company currently estimates that environmental capital expenditures over the next two years will average about million per year

in addition  the company established additional environmental reserves for discontinued operations 
the company has accruals of million at june  for costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites and for the company s current and former operating sites 
any claims for potential recovery have not been valued against the accrued environmental liabilities 
while ongoing litigation may eventually result in recovery of costs expended at certain of the environmental sites  any gain is contingent upon a successful outcome and has not been accrued 
based on information presently available  the company believes any amounts to be paid in excess of the accrued liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
risk management strategies the company operates globally  with manufacturing and distribution facilities in various countries throughout the world  and is subject to certain opportunities and risks  including currency fluctuations and government actions 
mallinckrodt generates a significant portion of its operating earnings and cash flows outside the united states and is positioned to benefit naturally from its use of approximately currencies  as currency fluctuations are often offsetting 
operations in each country are monitored so that the company can quickly respond to changing economic and political environments as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company uses certain derivative financial instruments  principally purchased options  forward contracts and currency swaps  to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rate risk 
the company uses the derivatives with an objective of limiting negative rate effects on overall performance for both budget and prior year comparisons over a rolling to month horizon 
the company seeks to have effective coverage levels of to percent of currency exposures that subject the company to risk 
the hedges are designed to satisfy the requirements for deferral accounting treatment at inception 
gains and losses in the hedges are expected to be systematically monetized with concurrent reinvestment to replace monetized hedges and maintain overall hedging coverage targets 
additionally  various operational initiatives are employed to help manage business risks 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities on earnings was immaterial for  and  including conversion of certain currencies into functional currencies and the costs of hedging certain transactions and balance sheet exposures 
the foreign currency translation loss included in shareholders equity  and resulting from the translation of the financial statements of most of the company s international affiliates into us dollars  increased by million in due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the functional currency of many of the company s international affiliates 
the company does not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on the businesses in which it operates 
while future economic events cannot be predicted  the company believes its current operations and future expansion plans will not result in a significantly different risk profile
