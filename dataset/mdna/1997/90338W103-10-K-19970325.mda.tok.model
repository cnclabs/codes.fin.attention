all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this section and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements and  although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
the following are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations cautionary statements 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
growth strategy  rapid growth 
the company s strategy is to grow through transactions with additional oncology groups and through the expansion of its affiliated physician groups 
identifying appropriate physician groups and proposing  negotiating and implementing economically attractive affiliations with them can be a lengthy  complex and costly process 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in identifying and establishing relationships with additional oncology groups 
the company has experienced rapid growth in its business and staff 
continued rapid growth may impair the company s ability to efficiently provide its management services to its affiliated physician groups and to adequately manage and supervise its employees 
the company s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is unable to manage growth effectively 
dependence on affiliated physician groups 
the company s revenue depends on revenue generated by the physician groups with which the company has long term management agreements 
there can be no assurance that existing and future physician groups with which the company affiliates will maintain successful medical practices  that the management agreements with the affiliated physician groups will not be terminated or that any of the key members of a particular physician group will continue practicing with such group 
loss of revenue by the affiliated physician groups could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition 
the business of providing health care related services is intensely competitive 
the company is aware of at least four competitors specializing in the management of oncology practices and several health care companies with established operating histories and significant resources are currently providing at least some management services to oncologists 
in addition  there are other companies with substantial resources that may decide to enter the oncology practice management business 
the company s revenues depend on the continued success of its affiliated physician groups 
the physician groups face competition from several sources  including sole practitioners  single and multi specialty groups  hospitals and managed care organizations 
see business competition 
reductions in third party reimbursement 
physician groups typically bill various third party payors  such as governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
these third party payors are increasingly negotiating the prices charged for medical services  pharmaceuticals and other supplies  with the goal of lowering reimbursement and utilization rates 
third party payors can also deny reimbursement for medical services  pharmaceuticals and other supplies if they determine that a treatment was not performed in accordance with treatment protocols established by such payors or for other reasons 
loss of revenue by the company s affiliated physician groups caused by cost containment efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company 
to the extent that patients or enrollees covered by a contract require more frequent or extensive care than is anticipated by the physician groups  the revenue to the affiliated physician groups derived from such contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of the services provided 
insufficient revenue under capitated or other risk sharing contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company 
health care regulation 
the health care industry is highly regulated at the federal and state levels 
the company believes its business is in material compliance with applicable law 
the relationships between the company and its affiliated physician groups  however  are unique and many aspects of these relationships have not been the subject of judicial or regulatory interpretation 
there can be no assurance that a review of the company s business by courts or by health care  tax  labor or other regulatory authorities would not result in determinations that could adversely affect the company s operations or that the health care regulatory environment will not change so as to restrict the company s existing operations or potential for expansion 
there are currently several federal and state initiatives designed to amend regulations relating to the provision of health care services  the access to health care  the costs of health care and the manner in which health care providers are reimbursed for their services 
however  it is not possible to predict whether any such initiatives will be enacted as legislation or  if enacted  what their form  effective dates or impact on the company will be 
see business regulation 
risks inherent in provision of medical services 
the company s affiliated physician groups are involved in the delivery of health care services to the public and are exposed to the risk of professional liability claims 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in damage awards to the claimants in excess of the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
insurance against losses related to claims of this type can be expensive and varies widely from state to state 
the company and its affiliated physician groups maintain liability insurance in amounts and coverages believed to be usual and customary 
nevertheless  successful malpractice claims asserted against the physician groups or the company could have a material adverse effect on the company 
see legal proceedings 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends on the services of its executive officers for the management of the company and the implementation of its business strategy 
the company has obtained key man life insurance on its chief executive officer and its president 
nevertheless  the company could be materially adversely affected if the chief executive officer  president or other executive officers were unwilling or unable to continue in the company s employ
