income statement analysis net interest income  margin and interest rate spreads net interest income on a tax equivalent basis is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities  with adjustments made to present yields on assets exempt from income taxes comparable to other taxable income 
changes in the mix and volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  their related yields  and overall interest rates have a major impact on earnings 
in  taxable equivalent net interest income provided of the company s net revenues  compared with in and in the company s taxable equivalent net interest income increased by to million in as compared to million in the increased level of taxable equivalent net interest income was driven by growth in average earning assets  principally loans and leases 
the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income of over the million reported in  resulted primarily from the increase in average earning assets and an increased spread between the prime lending rate and the short term us treasury rate 
the prime lending rate is the primary index used for pricing the company s loans and the short term treasury rate is the basis for pricing many of the company s deposits 
the company manages its earnings sensitivity to interest rate movements  in part  by matching the repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities and  to a lesser extent  through the use of off balance sheet arrangements such as caps  floors and interest rate exchange contracts 
net interest income from the use of such off balance sheet arrangements for was million compared to 
million in and million in the increase in net interest income was partially offset by the continued securitization and sale of loans 
securitized loan sales convert net interest income from loans to gains on loan sales and servicing revenue reported in noninterest income 
loan sales improve the company s liquidity  limit its exposure to credit losses  and may reduce its capital requirements 
the net interest margin  the ratio of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets  was in  in and in the increase in the margin in was due primarily to the expansion of the spread between the prime lending rate and short term us treasury rates

the company s actual future credit exposure is much lower than the contractual amounts of the commitments because a significant portion of the commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon 
in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine risk potential in the portfolio  and considers the results of independent internal and external credit review  historical charge off experience  and changes in the composition and volume of the portfolio 
other factors  such as general economic conditions and collateral values  are also considered 
larger problem credits are individually evaluated to determine appropriate reserve allocations 
additions to the allowance are based upon the resulting risk profile of the portfolio developed through the evaluation of the above factors

interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the company s financial exposure to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is  like liquidity  affected by maturities of assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity measures the company s financial exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company assesses its interest rate sensitivity using duration  simulation  and gap analysis 
duration is a measure of the weighted average expected lives of the discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
simulation is used to estimate net interest income over time using alternative interest rate scenarios 
gap analysis compares the volumes of assets and liabilities whose interest rates are subject to reset within specified periods 
the company  through the management of maturities and repricing of its assets and liabilities and the use of off balance sheet arrangements such as interest rate caps  floors  futures  options  and interest rate exchange agreements  attempts to manage the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates

information as to the company s interest rate sensitivity is presented in the table which follows 
the interest rate gaps reported in the schedule arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals  after considering the effect of off balance sheet financial hedging instruments
