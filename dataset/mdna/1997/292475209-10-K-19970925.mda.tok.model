there can be no assurances that revenues will remain at current levels or return to the levels experienced in prior years or that the company would be profitable at such revenue levels 
in addition  there can be no assurances that the company may not be required to utilize its line of credit even during profitable periods for various reasons including  but not limited to  the timing of component purchases and or customer orders and shipments 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that future requirements to fund operations will not require the company to draw on its line of credit again or seek additional financing  or that such line of credit or additional financing will be available on terms favorable to the company and its stockholders  or at all
