item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview the company manufactures products in two industry segments home heating products and leisure and other products such as do it yourself utility trailer kits and gas barbecue grills 
each of the industry segments in which the company operates is cyclical in nature  with sales being affected by general economic cycles  consumer confidence levels  inflation  employment and income levels and the availability of credit generally 
the company s fireplace business is also influenced by factors affecting the housing industry  such as housing demand  the availability of financing and the level and stability of interest rates 
prior to  the company manufactured products in the metal office furniture segment through its filex line acquired in in february of  the company elected to discontinue its metal office furniture operations 
the recent consolidation in the office furniture industry increased competition and margin pressures in the segment to the point of an unacceptable return to the company 
the metal office furniture segment s operations are treated as discontinued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
see results of discontinued metal office furniture operations 
on february   the company s newly formed wholly owned canadian subsidiary  ontario inc martin canada  acquired all of the capital stock of hunter energy and technologies inc and ontario inc 
 a sister company which owned the land and building leased by hunter energy and technologies inc for its manufacturing operation 
this transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price of approximately  included  in cash   in promissory notes payable and  paid into escrow 
transaction expenses of  were incurred 
the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the operations of the acquisition beginning february  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective january   hunter energy and technologies inc and were amalgamated to form hunter technology inc heat 
sales of home heating products and  in particular  gas and solid fuel heaters other than fireplaces  historically have been seasonal in nature  with sales being directly affected by weather conditions 
in an effort to better control its production schedule and inventory of finished products in light of this seasonality  the company utilizes early booking programs  which allow the company to project sales early in the year and plan production accordingly 
in general  the company takes early booking orders for its heating products in the first and second quarters and fills the majority of these orders in the second and third quarters  with fill in orders being shipped in the fourth quarter and to a lesser degree in the ensuing first quarter 
unseasonably warm weather results in higher customer inventories that in turn result in fewer fourth quarter customer fill in orders and lower response to the company s early booking programs for the following year 
see quarterly results 
notwithstanding the early booking programs  sales are recognized by the company when the product is shipped 
a majority of sales of gas and solid fuel heaters under the company s early booking programs historically have occurred in the second and third quarters  with products being shipped throughout this period 
orders under the company s early booking programs have historically represented up to of customers projected annual requirements and  because of program terms  the shipping period often extends over several months 
customer orders for products other than orders placed under the early booking programs are accepted and filled by the company as received and shipped at the customer s request 
as used in the following discussion and elsewhere in this annual report  the term gross sales reflects total customer invoices billed by the company for the applicable period  net of any customer sales credits issued 
the term net sales as used herein and elsewhere in this annual report  reflects gross sales less deductions for cash discounts  freight and special program credits allowed by the company 
in an effort to decrease the effects of seasonal sales of its home heating products and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies through increased capacity utilization  the company acquired its line of nuway utility trailer kits in and its line of broilmaster gas barbecue grills in the company s nuway and broilmaster products historically have been contraseasonal to the company s home heating products  with higher sales during warm weather months 
esop accounting the company established the martin industries  inc employee stock ownership plan and related trust the esop in  and in january the company borrowed million from its primary lender the bank loan  which funds were then loaned by the company to the esop the esop loan on terms substantially similar to those of the bank loan 
the esop loan enabled the esop to purchase approximately of the company s common stock on a fully diluted basis from existing stockholders 
the bank loan and the esop loan are payable in equal principal installments over years 
at the time of the origination of the bank loan and the esop loan and the consummation of the purchase by the esop of the company s shares  the company recorded the principal amount of the bank loan as long term debt and recorded unearned compensation in an equal amount  which is reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
pending repayment of the esop loan  shares owned by the esop are held in a suspense account 
shares of common stock are committed to be released from the esop s suspense account and credited to esop participants accounts based on the ratio that the principal debt repayment of the esop loan bears to the original principal debt balance ie  approximately  shares of common stock per year 
the company is required to recognize compensation expense each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to one fourth of the number of shares of common stock committed to be released each year multiplied by the average fair market value of such shares during the period 
the fair market value of the shares of common stock committed to be released and charged to compensation expense is also credited to stockholders equity 
accordingly  if the fair market value of the common stock increases  so will the company s non cash compensation expense related to the esop  which in turn has a negative impact on the company s net income and net income per share  but does not reduce the company s net worth 
because the company cannot predict the price at which its shares will trade in the future  it cannot predict the amount of non cash compensation expense it will incur based upon the release of the esop s shares to the participants accounts or the resulting effect on net income or net income per share 
to the extent dividends are declared and paid on shares allocated to participants accounts  the esop allows the administrative committee to use such dividends to repay the esop loan 
in such event  the dividends paid with respect to allocated shares are paid to participants in the form of released shares 
the negative impact on earnings will be partially offset by the impact of such dividends  since the company is not required to recognize compensation expense with respect to the release of shares related to dividends paid on esop shares allocated to participants

the company does not believe that it has a significant concentration of credit risk in any one geographic area or market segment 
currently  the company purchases credit insurance which provides coverage for losses on accounts receivable with certain primary customers 
inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation experienced over the last three years has not had a material impact on its sales or profitability 
the company has generally been able to absorb increases in costs without significantly increasing the selling prices of its products due to offsetting cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future
