item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales commercial us government cost of sales selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating profit loss other income expense net provision for income taxes earnings loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net earnings loss operating profit operating profit for the year ended april   improved by million over the year ended april  and by million over fiscal year this result was achieved through increased sales to non us government customers coupled with significant improvement in gross margins due to cost cutting and  as compared to fiscal  the conclusion of certain unprofitable contracts initiated by the company s former west coast operations 
reduced selling and administrative expenses and more focused research and development costs  as discussed below  further enhanced the operating results for the current fiscal year 
net sales net sales in fiscal increased by million over fiscal and by million over fiscal as illustrated in the table above  commercial sales have become the dominant portion of the company s business 
sales to such customers for the fiscal year ended april  increased by million over fiscal and by million over fiscal sales to non us government customers are expected to remain the major source of revenues in subsequent fiscal years 
the company will continue to engage in contracts for which the end user is the us government but such sales are not expected to increase significantly in absolute sales dollars due to the overall decline in us government procurement principally dod and nasa and the company s continuing contract suspension by the u 
s 
air force 
included in each of fiscal and commercial sales is approximately million of revenues related to parts procurement and screening services on behalf of the globalstar satellite program 
the company intends to actively promote its procurement services for other satellite programs 
fiscal commercial revenues continued the trend established in the prior fiscal year of increasing sales of the company s commercial product lines particularly for commercial rubidium 
sales of these product lines are expected to continue to grow as the company further advances its products into the marketplace 
gross margins gross margins for the fiscal year ended april   improved modestly over fiscal year increasing to from  both of which are substantially improved over the fiscal gross margin of 
the current year results reflect a continuation of the cost reductions and process improvements which were initiated in fiscal these results also reflect the growth in the commercial product lines where margins  in general  are larger than on us government related contracts 
in addition  fiscal year incurred costs associated with the restructuring and consolidation of the company s former west coast facility 
the retained assets and activities of that entity were relocated to the company s headquarters location during fiscal gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by the establishment of reserves for certain slow moving or obsolete inventory items and accruals for employee bonuses as a result of the profitable year 
without these charges to earnings  the gross margin would have been approximately 
similar items in fiscal had a negligible impact on margins 
while the company cannot reasonably predict the need for future inventory reserves or the possibility of cost overruns on existing or future contracts  the company expects that gross margins to be realized on recent bookings and existing contracts included in its current backlog will be comparable to those experienced during fiscal selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative costs declined by  or for the year ended april   over fiscal and by million or over fiscal the decrease from fiscal to resulted primarily from a decrease in bad debt expense by  while provisions for incentive bonuses in fiscal increased in tandem with the improved profitability of the company  this was more than offset by decreases in other compensation related areas such as adjustments in deferred compensation accruals  better than expected growth in cash surrender values of officers and employees life insurance  and lower administrative headcount which was effected in the first quarter of fiscal the principal cause of the decrease from the expense levels was a reduced amount of activity in and related to the company s defense of the ongoing litigation with the government and related actions 
related legal fees were million less in both and than in fiscal without regard to bad debt expenses  bonuses and the legal fees related to the government litigation  selling and administrative costs in fiscal were  lower than in and million lower than in this result was achieved through a reduction in the number of personnel  reduced insurance costs  lower usage of professional services and improved operating efficiencies 
as sales increase  the ratio of selling and administrative expenses excluding legal costs to net sales is expected to decrease 
the company is unable to predict the future level of legal costs for any specific period as this is dependent on factors outside of its immediate control 
research and development expenses research and development costs in the year ended april   increased by  over fiscal but decreased by  from the level of spending in fiscal the increase in over fiscal is due principally to costs related to the company s successful commmercial rubidium development efforts 
research and development spending in fiscal was higher than in the subsequent years principally due to an intense effort to develop the two vsat product lines 
in fiscal and  spending on these product lines continued but at a lower level 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those commercial projects which it expects will provide the best return on investment and provide the best prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal  the company expects to invest in research and development at approximately the same rate as it did for fiscal other income and expense for the year ended april   net nonoperating income increased by  over fiscal and by  over fiscal during fiscal year  the company realized a gain of approximately million on the sale of certain marketable securities 
excluding that one time gain  net nonoperating income has increased by million over fiscal iinvestment income increased by  and  over fiscal and  respectively  as the result of a continuing increase in interest earning assets in fiscal interest rates  which were lower in fiscal than in fiscal but higher than in fiscal  also impacted the level of investment income 
interest expense in fiscal decreased by  and  respectively  from fiscal and levels 
this was the result of declining long term debt balances as the company makes scheduled principal payments  as well as the same interest rate factors noted above 
although the company is unable to predict the future levels of interest rates  at current rates the company anticipates that investment income will continue to increase and interest expense will continue to decrease when compared to earlier fiscal years 
other income  net  which consists principally of income under the long term direct finance lease with lab corporation of america  should continue at moderately increasing levels over the year term of the lease 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april  although this is a decrease from the working capital position of million at april  this decline is wholly attributable to the reclassification to current liabilities of the real estate construction loan of million which is due january  originally july  before an extension was granted by the lender 
excluding that reclassification  working capital would have increased by million from the level at the end of the last fiscal year 
included in working capital at april  is million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which are readily convertible to cash 
the company s current ratio at april  is to compared to a to ratio at april  again excluding the reclassification of the construction loan  the current ratio would be to the slight decline in this current ratio is principally due to the company s declaration of its first dividend which was payable june  to holders of record on april  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april   was approximately million compared to million for fiscal this decrease in cash inflow is due to the growth in unbilled receivables of million  lower accounts payable and higher work in process inventory levels 
unbilled receivables have grown due to the increased volume in commercial contracts which do not provide the more generous upfront funding of the typical government related long term contract 
payables have decreased as the company has largely completed the purchase and rebilling of approximately million of parts under a procurement contract 
the second procurement agreement for million of parts for this same customer was only beginning as of the end of fiscal net cash used in investing activities for the year ended april   was million 
of this amount  million net was used to acquire certain us government and agency securities 
the company may continue to invest cash equivalents in longer term securities or to convert short term investments to cash equivalents as dictated by its investment strategies 
the company also invested  in production equipment which will improve the efficiency of its operations and an additional  was used to install new computer software which will improve its financial and operational information systems 
the company may continue to acquire more efficient equipment to automate its production process and to invest in additional computer software 
however  for fiscal  the company has no material commitments to acquire such fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended april   was  compared to million used for such purposes in fiscal of the fiscal amount   was provided from the sale of shares of common stock from treasury to satisfy the exercise of stock options granted to certain employees and the payment of  on notes receivable from certain officers and employees 
these inflows were offset by  used to make regularly scheduled long term debt payments 
the company will continue to use treasury shares to satisfy the future exercise of stock options granted to officers and employees in previous years 
the company may repurchase shares of its common stock for treasury whenever appropriate opportunities arise but it has neither a formal repurchase plan nor commitments to purchase additional shares in the future 
the company will continue to expend its resources and efforts to develop hardware for commercial satellite programs and commercial ground communication and navigation systems which management believes will result in future growth and continued profitability 
internally generated cash will be adequate to fund development efforts in these markets 
at april   the company s backlog amounted to approximately million as compared to the approximately million backlog at april  the april   backlog consists of approximately million for commercial and foreign customers and million for us government contracts 
the company anticipates that most of the backlog orders and contracts will be filled in fiscal as discussed more thoroughly in item legal proceedings and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is temporarily suspended from receiving new contracts from any agency of the us government  except under certain circumstances 
because of the company s transition to commercial products  the continuation of the suspension is not expected to have a material adverse effect on liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
in the event the company is convicted under the indictment discussed in item  the government may be awarded fines  penalties  restitution  forfeitures  treble damages or other conditional relief 
however  the company is unable to determine the effect that such awards may have on its liquidity or financial condition 
the company also has available for income tax purposes  approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards which may be applied against future taxable income 
other matters on may   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities statement 
pursuant to statement  investments in certain debt and equity securities are categorized as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from income and recorded directly to stockholders equity 
the favorable cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was approximately  or 
per share which was recorded during the year ended april  see discussion of recently issued pronouncements included in note to the consolidated financial statements
