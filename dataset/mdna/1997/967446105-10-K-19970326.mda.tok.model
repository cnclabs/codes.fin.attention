the company s operations  as well as those of the building material industry generally  have reflected substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of various factors  including levels of construction activity  general regional and local economic conditions  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates and the availability of credit  all of which are cyclical in nature 
the company anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
because a substantial percentage of the company s sales are attributable to building professionals  certain of these factors may have a more significant impact on the company than on companies more heavily focused on consumers 
the company s first quarter and  frequently  its fourth quarter are adversely affected by weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
the extent of such decreases in activity is a function of the severity of winter conditions 
while the company experienced a relatively mild first quarter in  severe ice storms in the northeast in  and record setting snow falls throughout the midwest and northeast in january of  have adversely affected construction activity in the first quarter of these years

the decline in gross profit as a percent of sales is primarily attributed to the company s continued emphasis on sales to the professional builder  resulting in an increase in the portion of the company s sales comprised of lower margin commodity products  and to a lesser extent a program to reduce the amount of excess and slow moving inventory
