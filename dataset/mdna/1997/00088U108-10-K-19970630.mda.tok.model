the company s consumer products generally have a lower unit price  higher cost of goods sold as a percent of price and lower gross margin

the lease was for additional space on another floor in the same office building as the company s headquarters 
the company is currently able to locate all employees on one floor  and does not anticipate a need for additional capacity in the foreseeable future 
the cost benefits due to reduction of personnel have been largely realized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  and the lease termination will be realized after march  at march   the company had net operating loss carryforwards available for tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in years through future sale of shares by certain significant shareholders could create a substantial ownership change as defined by the internal revenue service which would limit the amount of the company s future taxable income that may be offset by pre ownership net operating loss carryforwards
