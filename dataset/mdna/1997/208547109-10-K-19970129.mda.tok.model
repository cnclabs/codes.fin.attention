product revenues attributable to products in the company s workstream dfs product line increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal  which were up from revenues of  in fiscal the fiscal increase was due primarily to an increase in demand in the semiconductor and electronics industries for the company s workstream open applications and related third party products in the asia pacific region

the increase in services revenues in both fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to a higher installed base of the company s workstream dfs product line and to an increase in revenues from consulting services

development revenues 
development revenues increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal  which were down from  in fiscal development revenues include work associated with porting agreements and development contract work for third parties 
under these contracts and agreements  the company earns development and porting revenues  with third parties having the right to license and use the software  often sooner than otherwise would have occurred 
development revenues can vary significantly from period to period  depending upon the number of contracts which have been entered into 
it is difficult to accurately forecast the level of development revenues beyond the near term due to the timing and scope of development projects that may be changed during the period of development

these factors may include the relatively high average selling price of the company s products  a relatively small number of transactions  the size and timing of new orders  market acceptance of new products  introduction of competitive product offerings and subsequent deferrals in sales orders as competitive products are evaluated by prospective customers  the timing of co development projects with customers  expense levels  pricing changes  gain or loss of significant customers or distributors  and the general economic conditions in the company s primary markets 
results could be negatively affected if the semiconductor industry slowed its expansion  or if the healthcare products and process industries  which have not yet adopted computer automated manufacturing on a wide scale  do not develop into a strong market for the company s flowstream product line  or if the company is unsuccessful in managing system integration projects profitably 
any unfavorable change in these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
the operating results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for future financial periods
