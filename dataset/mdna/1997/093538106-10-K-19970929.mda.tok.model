item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  results of operations the company s net income decreased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the twelve months ended june  the company s primary earnings per share decreased to 
per share for the twelve months ended june  from 
per share for the twelve months ended june   while during the same periods  the company s fully diluted earnings per share decreased to 
per share from 
per share 
such decreases are attributable to the decreases in subfranchise and franchise fees  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  all of which are discussed below 
the company s continuing fees derived from domestic franchises increased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the twelve months ended june  continuing fees derived from international franchises increased during the twelve months ended june  to  from  during comparable period of fiscal these increases are directly attributable to the greater number of total open outlets as compared to the same periods ended in fiscal during the twelve month period ended june   the company experienced decreases in revenue from total subfranchise fees and franchise fees recognized 
the company believes that such decreases are the result of the saturation of the domestic market with subfranchisors and the maturing of the convenience store segment of the new concept marketplace 
with that in mind the company has refocused on traditional outlet development by increasing franchise advertising  and hiring more sales staff 
the company believes its refocusing on traditional outlet development will increase both franchise grants and outlet openings in the future 
in addition  the company will continue to place greater emphasis on developing the international market to mirror the success it has achieved in the united states 
although the company has strengthened its infrastructure and created an international department to support international expansion  the international market has not developed as rapidly as expected with regard to master license fees and outlet openings 
no assurances can be given that the above mentioned refocusing by the company will increase either franchise grants  master license fees or outlet openings  or if such increases do occur  that they will result in material increments in revenue 
the company and its franchisees compete in the quick service restaurant qsr industry  which is highly competitive with respect to price  service  outlet location and food quality  and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  local and national economic conditions influencing consumer spending habits  population trends and traffic patterns 
in awarding franchises  the company competes with a number of qsr franchisors and other business concepts  as well as for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for outlets 
the company and its franchisees also compete with regional and local franchised and independently owned outlet operations  many of which are larger in terms of financial resources and sales volume  than the company s chain of franchised outlets and its franchisees  respectively 
in addition to these constant obstacles to growth  unforeseen problems could arise which would keep the company from reaching its goals  eg  a strike by an equipment vendor or a material increase in borrowing rates  could temporarily slow down projected openings 
revenue from subfranchise  master license and franchise fees for the twelve months ended june  decreased to  from  for the same period ended the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of such fees

three of the nine domestic subfranchises provide for five or seven annual renewal term options  and if all of such options were to be exercised  the company would receive additional subfranchise fee revenues aggregating  this decrease resulted from the substantial achievement of the company s goal of saturating the domestic market with subfranchises 
during the twelve months ended june   domestic subfranchisors expanded and the company received  in fees in connection therewith 
if all renewal term options on these domestic expansions were to be exercised  the company would receive additional subfranchise fee revenues aggregating  by comparison during the twelve months ended june   nine domestic subfranchisors expanded and the company received  in fees 
such increases resulted from the company s efforts to expand beyond the major population centers located in existing subfranchise territories by the expansion of existing subfranchisors 
in addition  during the twelve months ended june   the company recognized  in principal payments received on deferred subfranchise notes due from existing subfranchisors and recognized  in annual renewal term options exercised by subfranchisors  as compared to  recognized in principal payments received on deferred subfranchise notes and  recognized in annual renewal term options exercised by subfranchisors during the twelve months ended june  the above described decreases in recognition of principal payments received on deferred subfranchise notes are directly related to the change  more fully discussed below  with respect to current accounts receivable  of issuing annual renewable subfranchise agreements as opposed to issuing to year subfranchise agreements 
the new agreements have been executed in connection with all subfranchise sales since november  and some subfranchisors operating under the prior agreement are replacing them with the new agreement  thereby eliminating principal and interest payments on the notes connected with the old agreements

total domestic franchise fees recognized decreased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the twelve months ended june  this decrease is attributable to the decrease to outlets traditional and new concept opened during the twelve months ended june   from outlets traditional and new concept opened during the comparable period ended this decrease in franchise fees recognized is attributable to the fact that many of the new concept outlet openings were the second  third  or fourth outlet opened in the same chain and these franchises were granted at a reduced rate  versus a traditional outlet  to entice the new concept chain to open multiple outlets 
the company derived  in franchise fees from the opening of thirteen international outlets during the twelve month period ended june   while for the same period ended  the company did not derive any revenue from the opening of five international outlets 
store equipment sales to domestic franchises increased to  during the twelve month period ended june  from  for same period ended during these same periods  store equipment sales to international franchises increased  from  these increases were attributable to the increase in orders processed by the company s equipment sales department to orders processed during the twelve month period ended june  from orders processed during the same period ended due to the success and experience obtained from selling equipment to blimpie franchisees  the company has decided to expand the equipment sales department in houston in order to sell equipment to franchisees of other chains 
the company believes this expansion will increase revenue and in turn the net income  however no assurances can be given that this expansion will generate increased revenue or net income 
management fees and other income for the twelve months ended june  decreased to  from  for the same period ended this decrease resulted from the january relocation of one of the company s subfranchisors who had previously been sharing office space in the atlanta office  therefore the fees the company was receiving for reimbursement of a portion of office expenses decreased 
the subfranchisors shares of continuing and franchise fees increased to  for the twelve months ended june  from  for the same period ended the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of such fees

current accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased to  at june  from  at june  deferred revenue decreased as at the same dates  respectively  to  from  said increase and decrease were the direct result of a policy  implemented by the company during fiscal  of issuing annual renewable subfranchise agreements  instead of subfranchise agreements having terms of to years 
under the previous agreements  if the subfranchise fees were collectible over an extended period of time and no reasonable basis existed for estimating collectibility  the fees were deferred and not recognized until they were collected or the uncertainty regarding collectibility was resolved 
under the new agreements  the subfranchisor purchases a territory for a one year period  followed by four to six renewal terms  all but the last being annual in duration 
if all terms and conditions of the agreement have been met during the initial one year term and each of the subsequent one year terms  a to year right is granted during the final renewal term upon payment of the fee set forth in the agreement 
the first year annual fee is recognized when all material services and conditions related to the sale are satisfied by the company 
subsequent years are recognized annually upon renewal 
the company still maintains numerous subfranchise agreements under the prior policy and continues to recognize revenue under these agreements consistent with prior years 
however  the amount of such revenue will continue to decline in the future as some of the prior subfranchise agreements are replaced with the new agreement  upon the subfranchisors request

the company s property  plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation  increased to  at june  from  at june  this increase resulted from the company s continued modernization and computerization of its offices 
other non current assets increased to  at june  from  at june  this increase primarily resulted from the company s purchase of a new accounting software package 
the company s accounts payable increased to  at june  from  at june  this increase resulted from the greater number of deferred payment  as opposed to cash on delivery transactions  effected by the company s equipment sales department  coupled with the longer periods that the company takes to pay equipment vendors with respect to purchase transactions financed by the company s franchisees 
in such cases  the company defers payment until the franchisee has given notice to the lender that the equipment has been installed and accepted  and the lender has delivered payment of the financed amount to the company 
accounts payable also increased as a result of the fees payable to the increasing number of subfranchisors 
income taxes payable at june  decreased to  from  at june  this decrease was the result of the payment of income taxes on september  and october   for fiscal year ended june  income taxes that had been accrued  and the decrease in net income 
the payment of fiscal year end bonuses to employees that had been accrued at june   resulted in the decrease in other current liabilities to  at june  from  at june  trademark obligations increased to  at june  from at june  such increase resulted from the recordation of the aggregate value of the remaining shares of common stock issuable by the company in connection with its acquisition of the canadian rights to the blimpie trademarks in october from an unaffiliated party

while the recognition of deferred subfranchise fees caused an increase in subfranchise fee revenue  the number of new subfranchises granted and the revenue received from those grants  decreased 
this decrease is a direct result of the fact that the company has almost reached its goal of saturating the major markets of the untied states with subfranchises  inasmuch as of the major us markets have been awarded

the company believes that such expansion will generate additional subfranchise fees and individual blimpie outlet growth  which would in turn generate increases in franchise fees and continuing fees  as subfranchisors continue to renew their subfranchise agreements with the company 
however  no assurances can be given that such subfranchisor expansion activity will continue  or if it does  that it will result in material increments in revenue
