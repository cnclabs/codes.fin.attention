as a result of this designation for sale  the company recognized a pretax loss of million in december  reflecting the write down of those securities with unrealized losses to estimated fair value 
during  the company  in connection with the balance sheet restructuring plan  sold billion of securities  including those designated for sale at the end of  and incurred a net loss of million

these factors were partially offset by a million charge in for the bank s portion of the special assessment  certain non recurring personnel expenses during  and gains on branch sales in of million 
the million improvement in the company s net income for  as compared with  largely reflected the impact of a million charge in associated with the cumulative effect on prior years of a change in accounting principle for goodwill  together with a reduction in restructuring and merger related expense of million and the recognition of gains on branch sales of million in the year to year improvement was also due to expense reductions associated with the merger  federal deposit insurance legislation and improving asset quality 
partially offsetting these factors was a million reduction in of the company s valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that was credited to operations  coupled with the write down to fair value of securities designated for sale in connection with the balance sheet restructuring plan  a reduction in net interest income of million  and the full year effect of the lincoln acquisition

results of operations net interest income the company s net interest income amounted to million in  up million  or  from  despite a million reduction in average interest earning assets during the company s net interest margin of for increased basis points from the level in contributing significantly to these increases were the implementation of the balance sheet restructuring plan  together with the impact of growth in the company s loan portfolio  a more favorable interest rate yield curve and lower funding costs 
in connection with the balance sheet restructuring plan  the company sold billion of securities available for sale during  including certain relatively lower yielding mbs  which contributed to the increase in the average yield on total average interest earning assets from in to in in furtherance of its objectives to increase its net interest income and net interest margin  the company significantly reduced its level of fhlbny advances during  while further expanding its use of securities sold under agreements to repurchase due to their generally lower cost as compared with fhlbny advances 
these factors  as well as the lower short term interest rate environment in as compared with  resulted in the company s cost of funds declining to in from in the company s net interest income of million in declined million from  and its net interest margin declined basis points from in to in the reduction in net interest income was due  in part  to the exchange  in december  of all of the then outstanding shares of the bank s non cumulative exchangeable preferred stock the bank preferred stock for million in principal amount of the holding company s newly issued senior notes due november  the senior notes 
dividend payments on the bank preferred stock for periods prior to the consummation of this exchange are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income as minority interest preferred stock dividends of subsidiary  whereas interest expense on the senior notes is reflected as a component of interest expense on borrowed funds 
if the dividends on the bank preferred stock for were considered a component of net interest income during that year  net interest income for as compared with would have only declined million 
also contributing to the decline in the company s net interest income in as compared with was the relatively flat yield curve in existence during the greater part of the company s gross yield on average interest earning assets rose basis points in as compared with  due in part to the lagging nature of a significant portion of the company s adjustable rate assets

management of interest rate risk general the company manages its interest rate risk through strategies designed to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate exposure throughout a range of interest rate environments 
these strategies are intended not only to protect the company from significant long term declines in net interest income as a result of certain changes in the interest rate environment  but also to mitigate the negative effect of certain interest rate changes upon the company s mortgage banking operating results 
the company seeks to contain its interest rate risk within a band that it believes is manageable and prudent given its capital and income generating capacity 
as a component of its interest rate risk management process  the company employs various derivative financial instruments see derivative financial instruments 
the company s sensitivity to interest rates is driven primarily by the mismatch between the term to maturity or repricing of its interest earning assets and that of its interest bearing liabilities 
as is typical of most thrifts  the company s interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature  on average  sooner than its interest earning assets 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk arising from the option risk embedded in many of the company s interest earning assets 
for example  mortgages and the mortgages underlying mbs may contain prepayment options  interim and lifetime interest rate caps and other such features driven or otherwise influenced by changes in interest rates 
prepayment option risk affects mortgage related assets in both rising and falling interest rate environments as the financial incentive to refinance a mortgage loan is directly related to the level of the existing interest rate on the loan relative to current market interest rates 
extension risk on mortgage related assets is the risk that the duration of such assets increases as a result of declining prepayments due to rising interest rates 
certain mortgage related assets are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than others  resulting in a higher risk profile 
because the company s interest bearing liabilities are not similarly affected  the company s overall duration gap generally increases as interest rates rise 
in addition  in a rising interest rate environment  adjustable rate assets may reach interim or lifetime interest rate caps  thereby limiting the amount of upward adjustment  which effectively lengthens the duration of such assets 
lower interest rate environments may also present interest rate exposure 
in general  lower interest rate environments tend to accelerate prepayment rates  which both shorten the duration of mortgage related assets and accelerate the amortization of any premiums paid in the acquisition of these assets 
the recognition of premiums over a shorter than expected term causes yields on the related assets to decline from anticipated levels 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk resulting from the change in the shape of the yield curve ie  flattening  steepening and inversion  also called yield curve twist risk and to differing indices upon which the yield on the company s interest earning assets and the cost of its interest bearing liabilities are based basis risk 
in evaluating and managing its interest rate risk  the company employs complex simulation models to help assess its interest rate risk exposure and the impact  and probability of occurrence  of alternate interest rate scenarios  which consider the effects of adjustable rate loan indices  periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment caps  estimated loan prepayments  anticipated deposit retention rates  and other dynamics of the company s portfolios of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
moreover  in order to reduce its sensitivity to interest rate risk  the company s investment strategy has emphasized adjustable rate loans and securities  as further discussed below  and fixed rate medium term securities 
of the company s billion of residential property loans receivable at december   billion were adjustable rate loans 
the interest rate adjustments for these loans are based on a fixed margin over various indices  including cost of funds indices cofi and indices based on certain united states treasury interest rates treasury indices 
because the repricing of adjustable rate residential property loans that are based on cofi particularly the national monthly median cofi tends to lag market rate changes  substantially all of the company s adjustable rate residential property loan production in recent years has consisted of loans tied to the treasury indices 
at december   approximately of the company s adjustable rate residential property loans were based on the treasury indices  up from approximately at december  annual interest rate adjustment caps on the company s residential property loans receivable have generally been two percentage points 
many of these adjustable rate loans have lifetime interest rate adjustment caps  which have generally been six percentage points over the initial interest rate 
at december   the company s adjustable rate residential property loans receivable consisted principally of loans with lifetime interest rate caps ranging from to 
of the company s billion commercial and multifamily first mortgage loan portfolio  approximately were adjustable rate 
of such adjustable rate loans  approximately were based on a fixed margin over the treasury indices and approximately were based on a fixed margin over various fhlbny advance rates 
at december   approximately of the aggregate billion portfolio of mbs available for sale and held to maturity consisted of adjustable rate securities 
the predominant indices underlying these securities are the one year treasury index and the eleventh district cofi published by the fhlb of san francisco 
the treasury indices mbs portfolio  which comprises approximately of the company s adjustable rate mbs portfolio  is backed predominantly by one year adjustable rate loans with a annual interest rate cap and a weighted average lifetime interest rate cap of 
the cofi mbs portfolio  which represents approximately of the company s adjustable rate mbs portfolio  is backed by loans with interest rates that adjust either monthly with no periodic interest rate cap  semi annually with a semi annual interest rate cap  or annually with a weighted average annual interest rate cap 
the cofi mbs portfolio had a weighted average lifetime interest rate cap of at december  derivative financial instruments the company uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to assist in managing its interest rate risk exposure  but does not currently use such instruments for trading activity purposes 
derivative financial instruments employed by the company at december  were interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floors  forward contracts  and options on certain of these and other instruments 
with the exception of interest rate floors hedging certain msr  the derivative financial instruments used by the company provide protection from rising interest rates 
while the company s use of derivative financial instruments has served to mitigate the effects of unfavorable interest rate changes on its results of operations  the company continues to be susceptible to a significant level of interest rate risk 
at december   the company used interest rate swaps and caps with a notional amount aggregating billion for asset liability management purposes 
the outstanding interest rate swaps at december   all of which provide for the company to be a fixed rate payer and a variable rate receiver based on short term london interbank offered rates libor  are utilized to convert specified fixed rate interest earning assets to a variable rate and specified variable rate interest bearing liabilities to a fixed rate 
interest rate caps employed for asset liability management purposes are used to hedge the periodic and lifetime interest rate caps embedded in specified adjustable rate loans and mbs or to lock in maximum interest costs of certain short term borrowed funds

in addition  the company utilizes interest rate floor agreements to minimize the impact of the potential loss of net future servicing revenues associated with certain of its msr as a result of an increase in loan prepayments  which is generally triggered by declining interest rates

thus  such derivatives possess market risk in their own right 
the company has established internal policies that define the extent of historical correlation between a hedge and hedged item prior to the use of the derivative financial instrument as a hedge 
the potential exists  however  that this relationship or basis may change due to extraordinary circumstances 
the company  also by policy  monitors these relationships at regular intervals to ensure that such correlation is maintained 
the company cannot guarantee that such historically observed relationships will continue
