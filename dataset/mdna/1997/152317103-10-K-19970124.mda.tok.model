change in fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its fiscal year end from the saturday following september to a fiscal year of or weeks ending on the saturday nearest october fiscal included weeks and ended november  fiscal years and included weeks and ended on october  and october   respectively 
the month ended october  is separately reported 
this change in the company s fiscal periods was made primarily to improve the company s operational efficiencies 
by moving the company s fiscal periods out one month  the company s manufacturing operations have incurred reduced overtime payments during the december and july holiday periods 
also  because many of the company s distributors have calendar quarter ends and place orders in the third month of the quarter  the company has not always been able to process and ship these orders during this third month of the calendar quarter because of the late receipt of these orders 
by staggering its fiscal quarters to end one month after the calendar quarter end  the company is in a better position to ship these late orders and at the same time avoid additional overtime and other expediting charges 
proposed acquisition in october the company entered into a letter of intent for the acquisition of voice tel enterprises and voice tel network voice tel 
the proposed transaction will involve the company issuing a certain number of shares of its common stock and assuming up to million of debt in exchange for all the capital of voice tel  and is intended to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the exact terms of the transaction  which will be subject to regulatory approval and require the approval of both companies stockholders  will be determined upon signing of a definitive merger agreement 
results of operations net revenue net revenue for fiscal was higher than net revenue for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to general expansion in the company s channels of distribution in connection with the introduction of the company s series platform  including an approximately increase in service provider business  improved performance of the company s larger distributors  and a increase in sales to customers located outside the united states which increased from million to million 
sales of the company s larger system configurations increased approximately as compared to fiscal  with smaller percentage increases in the company s smaller product configurations and system upgrades and expansions 
net revenue for fiscal was below net revenue for fiscal this decline in revenue primarily reflected a decline in sales of the company s large system configurations and reduced revenue from domestic  cpe and service provider customers 
such declines were offset in part by higher sales of the company s smaller product configurations  increased revenue from services and licensing of the company s text to speech software  and a increase in sales to customers located outside the united states 
the company believes that its revenue in fiscal was adversely affected by not having available during the year the new series product platform which was released in the first fiscal quarter of there can be no assurance that the market for voice processing products will grow in future periods at its historical percentage rate and the company believes that the growth rates of certain market segments have declined from prior levels 
there is also no assurance that the company s markets will remain at current levels in future periods 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or maintain its market share in the future  or to re attain historical growth rates 
see certain trends and uncertainties 
gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company reclassified certain customer training and support costs from selling  general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold to more properly reflect their current and anticipated future direct correlation to product and service revenues 
all financial data for fiscal and prior years have been reclassified for consistent presentation 
gross margin for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal this change in gross margin reflects lower margins on large system products due to higher warranty and international freight costs because of increased international shipments  offset in part by a favorable mix with large system products representing a larger percentage of sales than small system products which typically carry lower margins 
gross margin for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal this change in gross margin in fiscal resulted from a shift in product mix to a larger percentage of sales of small product configurations  which typically carry lower gross margins  and a decrease in sales of large system configurations  which typically carry higher gross margins than other products  lower gross margin rates on these product lines as well as on upgrade and system expansion products  and higher provisions for obsolete inventory related to the company s then forthcoming product transition 
these factors were offset in part by higher revenue from services and licensing of the company s text to speech software which carries significantly higher than average gross margins 
see certain trends and uncertainties 
research development research and development r d expenses for fiscal were higher than in fiscal this increase reflected general expansion of the company s product development programs and increases in compensation expenses due to higher headcount  and depreciation 
r d expenses for fiscal were higher than in fiscal this increase reflected the general expansion of the company s new product development programs  including significant investments in the series platform 
this increased spending was largely for higher staffing levels  depreciation  and facilities expenses  in particular  those facilities expenses related to the testing of new products 
as a percentage of net revenue  r d expenses were   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the large increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal relative to fiscal  resulted from a combination of higher research and development expenses and lower net revenue 
the company believes that ongoing development of new products and features is required to maintain and enhance its competitive position 
the company expects to continue to invest in r d and therefore r d expenses should continue to increase  notwithstanding the level of sales realized in future quarters 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in represented of net revenue and were higher than such expenses for fiscal  when they represented of net revenue 
the increase in sg a expenses in fiscal was primarily related to increased sales and marketing expenses and increased compensation and travel expenses due to higher headcount  offset in part by lower litigation expenses 
sg a expenses in represented of net revenue and were higher than such expenses for fiscal  when they represented of net revenue 
the increase in sg a expenses in fiscal was primarily related to increased levels of customer and sales support expenses and higher expenses related to international sales expansion  offset in part by lower litigation expenses 
the company believes that continued investments in sales and customer support  particularly in export markets  are essential to maintaining its competitive position and that the dollar amount of sg a expenses will increase in future periods 
the company expects that the dollar amount of sg a expenses will increase in future periods 
other income and expense  net interest income on investments increased in fiscal over such income in because of higher average interest yields as the company shifted its short term investments from tax free state and municipal bonds to higher yielding us government and agency obligations and corporate debt securities 
interest income increased in fiscal over because of higher average invested short term balances and because of higher interest rates 
interest expense declined over the three year period beginning in as the company s capital lease balances declined 
fiscal included a charge of  for the company s cost of settling its stockholder class action lawsuit and certain other litigation 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the company s effective tax rate for fiscal and was less than the statutory rate primarily because of tax exempt interest income and a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation account for prior year losses realized for tax purposes 
the company did not record an income tax benefit associated with the pre tax loss for fiscal  because deferred tax assets based on recoverable income taxes were recorded in prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at november  were million  decreasing million from october  at the end of fiscal and  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and million  respectively 
net cash used from operating activities was million during fiscal trade receivables at the end of fiscal increased million from the prior year balance primarily due to increases in sales but also due to extended payment terms granted to selected service provider customers 
days sales outstanding computed using quarterly revenues were days at the end of fiscal  compared to days at end of fiscal this increase in dso was primarily due to a larger percentage of quarterly shipments occurring in the last month of fiscal as compared to the same period in the prior year 
inventory levels at november  increased million over the fiscal balances because of increased levels of sales  increased inventory levels to support both the series platform and the new series platform  and increased customer support inventories 
the company expects investment in receivables and inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company made million in capital expenditures 
a significant portion of these expenditures were related to the introduction of the series platform and included expenses related to the upgrading and expanding of the company s engineering test labs and training classrooms and equipment purchased for increased engineering development efforts 
the company s principal sources of liquidity as of november  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million available under the company s bank line of credit which expires may  
the company expects to review this bank line in fiscal this bank line requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios  minimum working capital  minimum tangible net worth  and financial performance  and requires the bank s consent for the payment of cash dividends 
the company is in compliance with this agreement and there were no borrowings outstanding under the bank line as of november  the company currently expects to spend approximately million for capital equipment during fiscal the company may finance a portion of these expenditures through leasing arrangements 
the company presently believes  notwithstanding its accumulated deficit  that its existing cash and short term investments and credit under its line of credit and lease credit arrangements  will be sufficient to support the company s working capital and capital equipment purchase requirements at least through fiscal certain trends and uncertainties the company has in the past experienced and will likely in the future experience substantial fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company generally has no long term order commitments from its customers  and a significant portion of bookings and shipments in any quarter have historically occurred near the end of the quarter 
accordingly  the company has historically operated with very little backlog  and net revenue has been difficult to predict 
in addition  the portion of backlog shippable in the next quarter varies over time 
as a result  revenue in future quarters will depend largely on the level of orders received during such quarters 
if new order bookings do not meet expected levels  or if the company experiences delays in shipments at the end of a quarter  operating results will be adversely affected  and these developments may not become apparent to the company until near or at the end of a quarter 
net revenue can also be affected by product sales mix  distribution mix  the size and timing of customer orders and shipments  customer returns and reserves provided therefor  competitive pricing pressures  the effectiveness of key distributors in selling the company s products  changes in distributor inventory levels  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  regulatory approvals  and the availability of components for the company s products  each of which is difficult to predict accurately 
each of such factors has in the past affected the company s revenue 
a significant portion of the company s net revenue is attributable to a limited number of customers 
the company s top five customers  representing a combination of major distributors and service providers  accounted for approximately   and of the company s net revenue in fiscal   and respectively  although the company s five largest customers were not the same in these periods 
the company has no long term order commitments from any of its customers 
any material reduction in orders from one or more such customers or the cancellation or deferral of any significant portion of backlog could have an adverse effect on net revenue and operating results 
such concentration of sales typically results in a corresponding concentration of accounts receivable 
although the company has established reserves for uncollectible accounts  the inability of any large customer to pay the company could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see risk and uncertainties note to consolidated financial statements 
the company s gross margin can be affected by a number of factors  including changes in product  distribution channel  and customer mix  cost and availability of parts and components  royalty obligations to suppliers of licensed software  provisions for warranty  retrofits  and excess and obsolete inventory  customer returns  and competitive pressures on pricing 
the company has experienced increasing competitive pricing pressure in all markets and expects this pricing pressure to continue 
further  distributors purchase products at discounts  and the company s margins can therefore vary depending upon the mix of distributor and direct sales in any particular fiscal period 
the company anticipates that its sales mix will fluctuate in future periods 
as a result of the above factors  gross margin fluctuations are difficult to predict  and gross margins may decline from current levels in future periods 
the company s future success will depend in part upon the ability of the company to continue to introduce new features and products as the company s markets evolve  new technologies become available  and customers demand additional functionality 
the company s competitors continue to add functionality to their products  and any failure by the company to introduce in a timely manner new products and features that meet customer requirements would adversely affect the company s operating results and cash flows 
the company s ability to develop such new features and products depends in large measure on its ability to hire and retain qualified technical talent and outside contractors in highly competitive markets for such services 
there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will be successful  or that it will be able to introduce new products in a timely manner 
in this regard  the company during fiscal  announced significant new products  after experiencing delays in the introduction of such products 
moreover  customers expectations of the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors can adversely affect sales of current products 
in addition  upon the introduction of new products  the company could be subject to higher customer returns with respect to prior generations of products  which could adversely affect financial position  operating results and cash flows 
the company presently uses third parties to perform printed circuit board and subsystem assembly 
in addition  although the company has not experienced significant problems with third party manufacturers in the past  there can be no assurance that such problems will not develop in the future 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  certain microprocessors  line cards  application cards and other semiconductor devices and other components are available from sole sources 
other components  including power supplies  disk drives  certain other semiconductor devices and subcontracted line card assemblies  are presently available or acquired from a single source or from limited sources 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of these components in a timely manner from existing sources or  when necessary  from alternative sources of supply 
however  the inability to develop such alternative sources if and as required in the future  or to obtain sufficient sole or limited source components as required  would have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results and cash flows 
in addition  the company s products are dependent on the qnx software operating system  a multitasking  real time operating system for intel microprocessor based computers 
in future periods  the company s products may become increasingly dependent on software licensed from third party suppliers 
there can be no assurance such licenses will continue to be available to the company as needed or at commercially reasonable prices 
in recent years  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad markets fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  and general conditions in the computer and communications industries
