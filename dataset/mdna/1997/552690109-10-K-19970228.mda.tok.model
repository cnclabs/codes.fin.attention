item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following table in millions of dollars summarizes the contribution to consolidated earnings by each of the company s businesses 
years ended december  business electric natural gas distribution 
natural gas transmission construction materials and mining oil and natural gas production earnings on common stock earnings per common share return on average common equity earnings for increased million from the comparable period a year ago due primarily to higher oil and natural gas production and prices at the oil and natural gas production businesses 
increased retail sales at the electric and natural gas distribution businesses  primarily the result of percent colder weather than the comparable period a year ago  also added to the increase in earnings 
increased transportation of natural gas held under the repurchase commitment and increased volumes transported to storage  combined with the benefits of a favorable rate change implemented in january  at the natural gas transmission business further improved earnings 
in addition  earnings from baldwin and hawaiian cement  businesses acquired in april  and september  respectively  contributed to the earnings increase 
the write down to the then current market price of the natural gas available under the repurchase commitment partially offset the earnings increase 
the write down  which approximated million  or million after tax  was significantly offset by the reversal of certain reserves for tax and other contingencies at the natural gas transmission and oil and natural gas production businesses  aggregating million and million after tax  respectively 
the net effect of these items resulted in a million  or cent per common share  net charge to earnings for the year 
also somewhat offsetting the earnings improvement was the nonrecurring effect of a favorable ferc order received in april the order allowed for the one time billing of customers for million after tax  including interest  to recover a portion of the amount previously refunded in july in addition  increased purchased power demand charges at the electric business and increased operating costs at the electric  natural gas transmission and oil and natural gas production businesses partially offset the earnings improvement 
higher interest expense at the construction materials and mining and oil and natural gas production businesses also somewhat offset the earnings increase 
the effects of lower coal sales to the big stone station due to the expiration of the coal contract in august and the resulting closure of the gascoyne mine also partially offset the earnings improvement 
earnings for increased million from the comparable period a year earlier due primarily to increased retail sales at the electric business and increased throughput at the natural gas distribution and natural gas transmission businesses 
increased oil prices and oil and natural gas production at the oil and natural gas production business combined with the benefits derived from favorable rate changes at the natural gas distribution and transmission businesses also increased earnings 
the favorable rate change at the natural gas transmission business resulted from the previously described ferc order received in april on a rehearing request relating to a general rate proceeding 
income from hawaiian cement also contributed to the earnings increase 
earnings included the benefit of a million gain after tax realized on the sale of an equity investment in general atlantic resources  inc gari 
additionally  the effects of decreased natural gas prices at the natural gas transmission and oil and natural gas production businesses  lower coal sales to the big stone station due to the expiration of a coal contract in august  and increased costs associated with rainy west coast weather at the construction materials operations partially offset the earnings increase

fuel and purchased power costs decreased due to changes in generation mix between lower and higher cost generating stations 
this decrease was partially offset by higher purchased power demand charges 
the increase in demand charges  related to a participation power contract  is the result of the purchase of an additional five megawatts of capacity beginning in may  offset in part by the pass through of periodic maintenance costs during decreased maintenance expenses at the coyote station  due to less scheduled downtime  partially offset by increased turbine  generator and boiler maintenance at the heskett station  also improved operating income

the company s issuance of first mortgage debt is subject to certain restrictions imposed under the terms and conditions of its indenture of mortgage 
generally  those restrictions require the company to pledge of unfunded property to the trustee for each dollar of indebtedness incurred under the indenture and that annual earnings pretax and before interest charges  as defined in the indenture  equal at least two times its annualized first mortgage bond interest costs 
under the more restrictive of the two tests  as of december   the company could have issued approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds 
the company s coverage of fixed charges including preferred dividends was and times for and  respectively 
additionally  the company s first mortgage bond interest coverage was times in compared to times in common stockholders investment as a percent of total capitalization was and at december  and  respectively 
effects of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements reflect historical costs  thus combining the impact of dollars spent at various times 
such dollars have been affected by inflation  which generally erodes the purchasing power of monetary assets and increases operating costs 
during times of chronic inflation  the loss of purchasing power and increased operating costs could potentially result in inadequate returns to stockholders primarily because of the lag in rate relief granted by regulatory agencies 
further  because the ratemaking process restricts the amount of depreciation expense to historical costs  cash flows from the recovery of such depreciation are inadequate to replace utility plant
