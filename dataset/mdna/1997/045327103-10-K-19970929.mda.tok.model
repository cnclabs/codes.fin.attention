item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations since its founding in  the company has developed and marketed software and services to the process industries 
the company s revenues have grown each year since  when the company introduced the commercial version of its aspen plus modeling software product 
in addition to internally generated growth  the company has completed a number of acquisitions during the past three fiscal years 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  aspentech acquired isi  a leading supplier of ims software

as a result  comparisons of results for the years ended june    and are not meaningful 
the company typically licenses its modeling software products to customers for terms of either three or five years  planning and scheduling software for five or twenty five years  and its ims  apc and optimization software products for terms of years

interest income 
interest income is generated primarily from the sale of software pursuant to installment contracts for off line modeling software 
under these contracts  the company offers customers the option to make annual payments for term licenses instead of a single license fee payment at the beginning of the license term 
a substantial majority of the off line modeling customers elect to license these products through installment contracts 
the company believes this election is made principally because the customers prefer to pay for the company s off line modeling products out of their operating budget  rather than out of their capital budgets 
included in the annual payments is an implicit interest charge based upon the interest rate established by the company at the time of the license

provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate in fiscal is calculated as a percentage of income before taxes  exclusive of the non recurring charge for in process research and development 
the effective tax rate decreased in fiscal to of pretax income from in fiscal this percentage decrease related principally to non deductible acquisition costs incurred in connection with the isi acquisition in fiscal quarterly results the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
because the company ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders for software products  and revenues from software licenses in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders for software products booked in the quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has come from license contracts that have been effected in the final weeks of that quarter 
the revenues for a quarter typically include a number of large orders 
if the timing of any of these orders is delayed  it could result in a substantial reduction in revenues for that quarter 
since the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any revenue shortfalls would likely have a disproportionate adverse effect on net income 
prior to fiscal  the company experienced a net loss for the first quarter of each fiscal year  in part because a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from countries other than the united states where business is slow during the summer months  and also in part because of the timing of contract renewals 
the company expects that these factors will continue to affect its operating results
