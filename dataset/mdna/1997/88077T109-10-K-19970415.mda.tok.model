item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview results of continuing operations in and consist of o the fiber optic multiplexer and special services switch businesses of intelect network technologies company int from its april  acquisition  o the information security business of intelect europe limited iel from its august  acquisition  o the engineering services business of dna enterprises  inc dna from its february  acquisition  and o the videoconferencing system business of intelect visual communications corp 
ivc from its march  acquisition 
during the years ended october  and  the company was engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of sporting arms  through its subsidiary savage arms  inc savage 
the results of operations of savage are accounted for as discontinued operations due to the sale of savage on october  the company s fiscal year was changed to december in accordingly  due to the disposition of savage  the change in fiscal year  and the schedule of acquisitions above  any comparison of financial results to prior year periods would not be meaningful to determine a trend 
the following table shows the revenue and gross profits for the company s products two months year ended ended years ended december december october thousands of us dollars revenue product sales  services  contract revenue   interest and other income gross profit loss products services  contracts  net sales and services revenues in the year ended december  consisted primarily of engineering services revenues from the newly acquired dna and product sales at int 
sales of the s digital switch were the principal component of product sales in and in during the second half of  sales of sonetlynx fiber optic multiplexers made a significant contribution to the total for the first time since the product s introduction in the second quarter 
while not relevant to the year to year comparison  sales of dna services to external customers were up from the prior year when dna was not owned by the company 
the lanscape videoconferencing product was introduced in october after material and extensive improvements were made to the purchased technology 
the vubridge product was introduced in march lanscape made a small contribution to sales as initial shipments were primarily for demonstration and testing purposes 
contract revenues from longer term contracts for special services switches represent the completion of projects for iceland and greece 
sales increased in over due to the inclusion of the entire project for greece in see gross profit loss below 
information security products sold primarily to the uk military market were phased out as those operations in england were closed and submitted to liquidation at year end 
gross profit loss inclusion of the dna engineering services business in made a positive contribution to gross profit 
however  the margin was restrained because more than half the engineering services staff was dedicated to development of the cs  a project on which intercompany sales and profit are eliminated 
losses on contract revenues were primarily attributable to the iceland project which was completed in and experienced a greater loss in than in in addition  the losses and costs on product sales were increased by maintaining or increasing costs of operations and engineering infrastructure in order to prepare for the expected growth in sales and production of sonetlynx and lanscape 
the company believed these costs were prudently incurred because of the imminent receipt of significant orders 
that belief was confirmed by orders received in january and february for sonetlynx 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses sg a expenses were  in the year ended december    in the two month ended december   and  in the year ended october  the increased spending in is attributable to increased sales and marketing spending to launch new products and acquisition of new businesses 
the company spent  on sales and marketing in to develop markets and provide promotional support for all product lines 
spending  primarily in advance of sales  was approximately  for sonetlynx and  for lanscape 
at the same time  sales and marketing activities resulted in a  backlog of unfilled orders at december   up from  at the prior year end 
by march  the backlog had grown substantially 
g a expenses were  in due primarily to the inclusion of newly acquired businesses 
int expenses of  were in line with the prior year 
dna contributed  to the total  iel  and ivc  corporate expenses were  including legal and other costs related to external financing 
engineering and development e d expenses e d expenses in the three months ending december  include a one time charge in december of  to expense cs software development costs previously capitalized 
the evolution of the cs project led to a reassessment of the product definition in december a necessary consequence of the redefined product was to cause the expensing of previously capitalized costs because technological feasibility had not been attained for all the inter related modules of the product 
e d expenses for the year were  and an additional  representing sonetlynx software development cost was capitalized 
total costs of major projects in were including e d expense  software capitalized  and additional amounts charged to cost of sales or to technology amortization o  for development of the cs smart programmable switch to the prototype stage  o  for development of the initial components of sonetlynx  o  for development of a viable lanscape product from purchased technology  and o  for development of two standard dsp products 
asset write downs in connection with the acquisition of ivc  certain assets and licenses  which constituted the design of a videoconferencing product  were purchased from a major computer company 
the design proved to be flawed and market introduction was delayed approximately nine months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the technology purchase 
the company deemed the recoverability of ivc goodwill to be significantly impaired by the delay in introduction of the product to a rapidly changing market and accordingly reduced the carrying value of ivc goodwill by  its remaining unamortized net book value at the time and wrote off  of fixed assets deemed of no value 
the company s assessment of the future prospects for the information security products business in the united kingdom led to a complete shut down of those operations in chesterfield  england at the end of in january  liquidation proceedings began 
the company was an unsecured creditor of iel and wrote off all net assets related to those operations in england in the amount of  amortization and depreciation amortization and depreciation expenses were two months year ended ended years ended december december october thousands of u 
s 
dollars depreciation of property and equipment amortization of goodwill  technology amortization  depreciation is included in cost of sales and selling  general and administration expense in the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation of property and equipment has increased due to acquisitions and due to purchases of new manufacturing  engineering  and office equipment 
goodwill is amortized over periods from to years 
the increase in is due to the purchase of dna and ivc 
in december  goodwill related to the acquisition of int was increased  due to the payment of certain contingent consideration due to former int shareholders see note a to consolidated financial statements 
technology amortization relates to intellectual properties purchased in and the amounts of amortization and depreciation expenses in are not indicative of the continuing rates because capital purchases are planned to exceed depreciation and cause some increase in the current rate  goodwill of ivc and iel will not be available for amortization  and license payments to the vendor of technology used by ivc are being curtailed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense of  in the year ended december  consists of interest on the face value of the june  august and october debentures of  non cash financing costs associated with the issuance of the debentures of  and other interest of  on march   the securities and exchange commission first issued a staff announcement entitled debt or preferred stock convertible at discount to the market which requires recognition as interest expense an amount which measures the beneficial conversion feature of certain convertible debentures  and accounting treatment which accelerates the recognition as interest expense of deferred financing costs 
the staff announcement also required immediate implementation necessitating the retroactive restatement of financial statements 
accordingly  the company retroactively conformed its accounting for the june  august  and october debentures to the requirements of the staff announcement 
this had the effects of recognizing as interest expense a  amount allocated to the beneficial conversion feature  and changing the accounting for and accelerating the recognition of deferred financing costs in the amount of  these non cash expenses  together with  deferred financing costs recognized as interest expense prior to the staff announcement  constitute the  total debenture related interest expense 
cash financing costs attributable to the issuance of the june  august  and october debentures were   and  respectively 
non cash costs in the form of warrants for common stock valued using the black scholes pricing model were   and  respectively 
additionally  allocations of proceeds to the beneficial conversion features of the debentures were   and  respectively 
the debentures were considered to be in the money on the date of issue due to the conversion discount 
therefore  all financing costs are being amortized over the periods bounded by the issuance dates and the earliest conversion dates  resulting in total amortization of   and  respectively  in an additional amount of  of deferred financing costs will be recognized as interest expense in the first quarter of due to the exercisability of the balance of the october debentures 
income loss from discontinued operations the company sold savage corporation and its subsidiaries  including savage arms  inc savage on october  the results of savage are accounted for as discontinued operations and  accordingly  comparative presentations reflect the company s equity in the earnings of savage for the relevant periods 
the gain on the disposition of savage occurred in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   cash used in operations  and by investing activities  was funded by using  of available cash balances and by securing new financing  net of repayments  of  as a result  working capital decreased from  to  at december  operating activities net cash used in operations was  for  consisting primarily of operating losses partly attributable to the following costs o  of e d to bring new products to market in and o  of e d to develop the cs smart programmable switch with no product sales currently expected to be derived until o approximately  of sales and marketing expenses for market development in advance of sales based on expected increases for sonetlynx and lanscape products in o approximately  of manufacturing overhead costs maintained at a higher level than required by sales in order to prepare an operations infrastructure  including a computer system startup to support the higher levels of production currently expected in of these four sources of spending  the discretionary portions were approximately o of new product development for air traffic control features and early sonetlynx o of cs development o of advance sales and marketing o of advance infrastructure building the company committed these discretionary amounts because the product developments were directed at markets believed to have very large growth potential  and near term sales and production growth opportunities appeared to justify some investment to stimulate the sales and prepare for production 
the anticipated near term growth is expected to be realized in  especially for sonetlynx products 
investing activities investment spending included  for fixed assets  primarily equipment for product design and for manufacturing 
as much as of this spending may have been discretionary 
 was spent on the acquisitions of dna and ivc including working capital advances prior to acquisition 
financing activities in addition to cash balances at the beginning of the year  operations and investments in were funded by the issuance of three series of convertible debentures in the amount of  by the end of the year   of the debentures were converted to common shares and by march   an additional  of the debentures were converted see note to consolidated financial statements 
outlook and financial strategy the company currently expects ongoing product sales and production activity to increase significantly over the levels of these increases are expected to create increased working capital requirements 
in addition  the company intends to continue investing in certain product development activities 
the financial plan which results from these expectations currently indicates a peak cash requirement from external sources of approximately  in this plan assumes that the  balance of obligations to pay former owners of dna can be extended see note to consolidated financial statements and that no payments will be made to the licensor of video conferencing technology pursuant to a license agreement which is in dispute see note to consolidated financial statements and intellectual property in item 
in the event that working capital requirements exceed sources  the company has contingency plans to curtail spending on product development and marketing activities  with priority given to spending that is not in pursuit of near term benefits 
the company currently plans to fund its external requirements by completing a  credit facility of which it has executed binding agreements for up to  as of march  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company considers it prudent to pursue financing of amounts greater than its most likely expected cash requirements in order to have the flexibility to respond to additional product development and growth opportunities or to respond to other cash needs 
for those reasons  the company is pursuing additional funding through private or public financings and through collaborative arrangements with existing and potential customers 
financial plans do not anticipate any significant payments for maturing convertible debentures in august or october due to the experience of  converted in and  converted in the first quarter of  the company expects the debenture holders to convert the balance of  before maturity 
a collaborative approach is being pursued with respect to the cs product development 
the company has begun discussions with several major telecommunications companies regarding the possibility of forming an alliance or partnering for the combined purposes of a endorsing or branding the cs product with a major trade name  b permitting some preferred access to the product by one or more large customers  and c funding a substantial portion of continuing development expenses 
any funding from such sources would likely be accompanied by an upward revision in planned expenses so that market entry could be accelerated 
funding by the proposed partnering process would be in addition to traditional financing previously discussed 
conclusion considering the financing resources available and potentially available  the outlook for cash available from customer collections  the outlook for cash uses in operations and investing  and the options available to reduce spending  the company believes it has the financial resources to meet its business requirements through the current year 
there can be no assurance  however  that the proposed financings or the business results assumed in the financial plan will be realized 
the financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the unfavorable outcome of such an uncertainty 
contingent liabilities as discussed in item  legal proceedings  the company is exposed to certain contingent liabilities  which  if resolved adversely to the company  would adversely affect its liquidity  its results of operations and or its financial position 
additional factors that may affect future liquidity and operating results this form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of as amended 
actual events and results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
in particular  the recent growth in production and sales may not be sustained if production is interrupted by a planned facility relocation  materials including those supplied from sole sources are not available  the sales force does not identify new customers  the company s credit condition inhibits major customers  or new sonetlynx and videoconferencing product developments are delayed 
the financial plan includes commitments to significant amounts of spending for product development  sales and marketing activity  and manufacturing capacity predicated on a high rate of sales growth each quarter 
if the rate of sales growth is not sustained  certain of the expenses will not be sufficiently controllable in the short term to avoid a negative cash flow impact 
there can be no assurance that the currently high level of credit quality among the company s customers can be sustained 
accordingly  customer collections may not achieve the assumptions of the plan 
in order to meet increasing levels of demand for manufactured products the company must make estimates of future orders with enough precision to insure the availability of certain components with long lead times 
any inaccuracy in such estimates could affect the expected operating results 
in general  there can be no assurance that component parts will be available in sufficient quantity and on suitable credit terms to support the planned growth in production rates 
adequacy of the financial plan is partly dependent on the company s ability to renegotiate payment obligations to former owners of dna and to renegotiate a technology license with a major computer company 
there can be no assurance that either of these assumed negotiations will be accomplished with the cash flow consequences assumed in the plan 
external business conditions may also contribute risk to achieving the plan  especially the rate at which telecommunications companies adopt certain new products and the demand for engineering design services which are contingent on the development budgets of others 
funding plans include uncertainties  namely  the balance of the credit facility may not become available  alternative external sources of financing may not be secured in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to the company or at all  availability of external sources may be affected by general market price volatility  holders of convertible debentures may not convert remaining balances to equity  and or partner funding of cs development may not be secured soon enough to avoid development delays 
the company s ability to raise funds from external sources may be restricted by adverse resolution of legal proceedings discussed in contingent liabilities
