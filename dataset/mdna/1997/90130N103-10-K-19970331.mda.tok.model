item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition the company s financial condition continued to improve in as shown in the following table amounts in thousands except per share data adjusted operating cash flow   book value per share debt to equity ratio statutory surplus of insurance subsidiaries    net written premiums to surplus ratio am best rating b b b for  excludes million  net of commissions  in homeowner and condominium unearned premiums ceded to reinsurers in july equity adjusted to exclude unrealized investment gains or losses 
as indicated in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the northridge earthquake had a significant adverse effect which required a variety of measures to be taken to improve the company s financial condition 
in particular  the statutory surplus strain caused by the earthquake was alleviated by capital infusions funded through borrowings and the issuance of equity securities see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  and by suspending dividends from the insurance subsidiaries to the parent and from the parent to common shareholders 
additionally  the company s direct exposure to future earthquake coverage losses was completely eliminated in the company s only significant remaining catastrophe exposure is in the homeowner and condominium lines  primarily relating to potential wild fires and fire following an earthquake event  which remained adequately protected by reinsurance 
the number of vehicles in force began growing again in the fourth quarter of for the first time in nine quarters 
meanwhile  the company did not need to resort to workforce cutbacks or layoffs during this particularly challenging time to maintain its low expense ratio 
as a result  the company s most important resources  its dedicated and experienced employees  are in a unique position to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and improved customer service that lie ahead 
results of operations units in force units in force for the company s insurance programs as of december were as follows private passenger automobile number of vehicles    homeowner and condominium number of policies    personal excess liability pelp number of policies    total    the company maintained average annual unit growth of over during the ten years prior to that growth trend was interrupted for nine quarters starting with the third quarter of  when the surplus strain created by the northridge earthquake caused the company to reduce its insured exposures 
this was accomplished by a combination of cessation of advertising and marketing for new policies in the first quarter of  cessation of writing new homeowner and condominium policies in june  the non renewal of all existing earthquake coverages in july  and  rate increases of in the homeowner line effective august  and and in the automobile line effective october  and june   respectively 
information about more recent developments relating to units in force within each major coverage line follows 
private passenger automobile 
in  with its financial condition restored substantially to pre earthquake levels  the company was once again able to focus on the growth of its core automobile business 
the company  in connection with an aggressive marketing campaign and declining trends in loss costs and frequency  lowered overall rate levels approximately in effective march  in connection with a new auto rating plan  effective june  to implement a new persistency discount  and effective september  in response to continuing favorable loss trends 
these actions helped to achieve increases in new business production and the rate of renewals and led to a resumption of growth in the number of vehicles in force during the fourth quarter of vehicles in force grew by  in the fourth quarter of  and were up  in the first two months of  compared to declines in the comparable year ago periods of  and  respectively 
recent legislative changes could cause increases in the number of policies issued to previously uninsured motorists or drivers eligible to participate in the california assigned risk plan caarp 
because both categories historically have been characterized by underwriting losses  growth in those areas would dampen future underwriting results  in view of the current political and regulatory climate  it is difficult to envision that premium rates for such risk categories could be adjusted to adequate levels in the near future 
vehicles in force relating to previously uninsured drivers stood at   and  at december   and  respectively 
vehicles in force for this segment of the auto line rose  in the first two months of vehicles in force for the assigned risk segment were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
in the first two months of  assigned risk vehicles increased by  units  bringing them generally back to the level 
it is too early to tell whether these rates of growth will continue 
homeowner and condominium 
on december   the doi amended its previous order to permit the company to begin renewing homeowner policies effective february  at that time approximately  homeowner policies remained in force 
those renewals will be subject to an overall rate increase effective april  unless the company is granted permission to resume writing new homeowner policies  the impact of this line on future underwriting results is likely to remain insignificant 
pelp 
the penetration of this coverage has averaged about of the vehicles in force during the three years ended december   which is not expected to change significantly in underwriting results premium revenue and underwriting results for the company s insurance programs follow 
to facilitate comparability  the effects of the earthquake coverage and the proposition settlement have been isolated from the core business in the table below 
years ended december  amounts in thousands gross premiums written automobile    homeowner and condominium excluding effects of earthquake and prop

these results compared favorably to profits in and of million and million  respectively  as adjusted for the effects of the earthquake and proposition the increase in underwriting profit primarily reflects favorable loss trends while the increase was mainly due to the rate increase implemented in october and the increase implemented in june gross written premiums in decreased from reflective of the reduction in insured units and  to a lesser extent  the effect of the three premium rate reductions implemented in a total reduction of 
the impact on gross written premiums of the rate reductions will not be fully felt until the end of the first quarter  six months after the latest reduction was implemented 
net earned premiums also declined in reflecting both a reduction in insured vehicles and the impact of the quota share treaty with the aig affiliate 
the voluntary automobile insurance business written by the company is comprised of good drivers as defined by california statute 
while the majority of this business would have been acceptable to the company before proposition  those who had no prior insurance would have been written at a higher rate level than those who had been insured prior to being written by the company 
these drivers have produced automobile underwriting losses of  in compared to  in and  in the sharp decline in losses in is reflective of the continuing effect of the implementation of premium rate increases as well as an overall decline in the number of these vehicles insured 
the combined ratio for this segment of the business was 
compared to in and in overall automobile underwriting results are also affected by assigned risk 
underwriting losses for assigned risk business were  in  compared to  in and  in combined ratios for this business for the same periods were  and  respectively 
the decrease in underwriting losses in was primarily due to a drop in vehicles in force since coupled with the effects of a rate increase implemented in june the future effect of the assigned risk plan on the company cannot be predicted because it depends on the ability of the state administered plan to achieve and maintain an adequate rate level 
homeowner and condominium excluding earthquake and proposition settlement underwriting results for these programs are subject to variability caused by weather related claims and by infrequent disasters 
in  no significant losses were incurred 
in  the underwriting loss for this line included first quarter weather related losses of million and an overall decline in homeowner and condominium premium volume 
the company has maintained reinsurance programs to provide coverage through the planned run off period of its remaining homeowner policies 
effective july  the company entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with f g re and risk capital re on its remaining homeowners book 
these companies assumed the total liability for related unearned premium reserves at june  of million in exchange for cash payment by the company 
the company received commission on the transfer of approximately million  or 
the total commission rate per the agreement is subject to ultimate loss and expense ratios experienced  and is not to exceed or to be less than 
the quota share agreement covers all written exposures on homeowner policies renewing on or before july  through the end of their one year policy term 
these policies do not cover earthquake losses  and the company s exposure to fire following an earthquake on these policies is covered by the agreement 
for homeowner policies renewing on and after february   the company has no exposure to earthquake losses 
as the number of homeowner policy renewals increase after february   the company intends to reduce its exposure to other losses on this line  as appropriate  through reinsurance 
the company had maintained separate catastrophe coverage on these lines which expired in june  written premiums ceded for these lines in totaled million excluding the million portfolio transfer of unearned premium liabilities under the quota share reinsurance agreement  compared to million in and million in personal excess liability the personal excess liability program has remained stable over the three year period ended december  producing approximately million in gross written premiums each year 
underwriting profits can vary significantly with the number of claims which occur infrequently 
the results of this line are considered largely immaterial compared to the overall results of the company 
earthquake and proposition although the company did not write new or renewal earthquake premiums in or  the company assumes a small amount of earthquake premium from the california fair plan  a state administered pool of difficult to insure risks in which insurers are required to participate in proportion to their share of direct written homeowners coverage in the state 
the negative premiums earned for the earthquake and proposition in and are due to the large amounts of reinsurance purchased  primarily in  to protect the company until the earthquake endorsements expired in july policy acquisition and general operating expenses the company s policy acquisition and general operating expense ratio continues to be among the most competitive in the industry 
the ratio of underwriting expenses excluding loan interest and fees to earned premiums was in  in and in the decline in the ratio from to reflects the impact of the ceding commission earned on the quota share agreements with an affiliate of aig and  in  with f g re and risk capital re 
additionally  there was a reduction in general operating expenses due to the decline in business as well as cost efficiencies 
the company believes that its ability to write and administer its business in a cost efficient manner will enable it to regain and maintain price leadership in the industry and provide for future growth and profitability 
investment income net pre tax investment income was  in compared to  in and  in average invested assets decreased in  compared to decreases of and in and  respectively 
the decline in invested assets is the result of the company s sale of these investments to meet the payment requirements of both developing earthquake losses and reinsurance premiums 
the average annual pre tax yield on invested assets has remained relatively stable over the past three years  the average yield was in  in and in realized capital gains on the sales of investments have declined over the past three years  generally reflective of a change in the mix of taxable versus non taxable securities held and an overall decrease in the amount of investments needed to be sold to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses 
as of december   the company had a net unrealized gain on fixed maturity investments of  compared to  in and an unrealized loss of  in the primary reasons for the shifts in unrealized gains and losses are twofold 
interest rates rose sharply in but fell in reducing the fair value of the bond portfolio in and increasing it in the decrease in unrealized gains between and resulted largely from a declining bond market coupled with an overall decline in invested assets 
in  the company sold practically all appreciated fixed maturity investments to cover earthquake loss payments 
of the company s total investments   at fair value was invested in tax exempt state and municipal bonds and the balance was invested in taxable government  corporate and municipal securities at december   and the portfolio contained approximately taxable instruments 
liquidity and capital resources loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirements of the company 
the company continually monitors loss payments to provide projections of future cash requirements 
additional cash requirements include servicing the bank debt and paying the quarterly dividend on preferred shares of  with the anticipated growth of its core auto business and continued settlement of remaining earthquake losses  the company expects that future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future expenditures 
the company has historically written its core businesses at an underwriting profit and thus each premium dollar produces positive cash flow 
a significant part of the decline in cash flow from operations in and is due to the decline in the size of the net book of business during those periods 
this decline would decrease cash flow  even without consideration of earthquake losses  until the patterns of cash inflows premiums and outflows claims reach equilibrium 
in addition  in approximately million of the million net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was related to the portfolio transfer of unearned premiums on homeowners business 
cash flows from operations in and were not sufficient to fund underwriting operations of the company due to losses from the northridge earthquake 
in  the company paid for these losses with cash flow from operations  investment sales  loan proceeds and equity financing 
for  funds needed to pay these claims as well as proposition rebates came from normal operating cash flows  available cash on deposit  additional loan proceeds of million and preferred stock proceeds of million 
funds required by th century industries to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations are provided by the insurance subsidiaries 
information regarding the company s debt service obligation is included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company is regulated by state law 
based on the operating results in and the favorable ratio of premiums to surplus  the company was able to resume normal dividends from the insurance subsidiaries in to service the parent s debt and preferred dividend requirements 
based upon operating results and earned surplus as of december   the company believes dividends in will not require extraordinary regulatory approval 
the company expects to have very small cash outlays for income taxes  specifically alternative minimum tax  for the next two to three years 
until the net operating losses caused by the northridge earthquake are fully utilized  the company expects that cash outlays for income taxes will be less than income tax expense recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the year risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners requires property and casualty insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk based capital rbc formula in their annual statements 
the rbc requirements are intended to assist regulators in identifying inadequately capitalized companies 
the rbc calculation is based on the type and mix of risks inherent in the company s business and includes components for underwriting  asset  interest rate and other risks 
the company s insurance subsidiaries exceeded their rbc statutory surplus standards by considerable margin as of december  to the extent that the subsidiaries would fall below prescribed levels of surplus  it would be the parent company s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity
