since  the trust has focused on the commercial segment of the real estate market  specifically industrial and office properties located in new england

as of such date  the trust s commercial properties were leased to tenants and aggregated  square feet  industrial   office research and development   office  and  retail 
the multi family properties consist of five wholly owned residential communities aggregating  units 
at november   the commercial and residential properties were and leased  respectively 
during  the trust acquired six massachusetts properties and a portland  maine office complex portland square acquisition 
the portland square acquisition consists of  square feet of leaseable space located in two buildings and a space surface parking lot 
with the exception of the portland square acquisition which was made subject to existing mortgages aggregating million  the acquisitions were purchased with cash generated from trust operations  new borrowings and the proceeds from the sale of real estate investments 
a summary of the real estate acquisitions is as follows date square property type location acquired feet cost industrial franklin  massachusetts   marlborough  massachusetts   franklin  massachusetts   franklin  massachusetts   office r d tewksbury  massachusetts   andover  massachusetts   office portland  maine   portland  maine   other land portland  maine  other  total   during  mgi invested an aggregate of million to acquire eight properties  including three office and five industrial buildings  and completed the acquisition of a retail building

at november  the trust s portfolio of new england investments totaled properties having an aggregate cost of million  which represents of the trust s investment in real estate based upon cost  and million square feet  or of the trust s total commercial space 
results of operations compared to net income for of million  or per share  included net gains of million  which resulted from i the sale of three industrial buildings  one located in massachusetts and two located in ohio  and ii the sale of the trust s partnership interest in a san bruno  california apartment complex 
the sale of the partnership interest resulted in a gain of million  which included a previously deferred gain of million 
net income for was million  or per share  which included net gains from property sales of million 
income before net gains increased from million in to million in funds from operations ffo in totaled million  compared to million in in  mgi implemented the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc s nareit recommended changes in the calculation of ffo 
mgi calculates ffo in conformity with the nareit definition  which is net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the nareit definition stipulates  among other things  that in calculating ffo  leasing costs should be capitalized and not deducted as an expense 
this had the effect of increasing the trust s ffo by approximately million in and million in mgi believes ffo is an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance 
the following is a reconciliation of net income to funds from operations years ended november  net income   less net gains   plus building depreciation   plus tenant improvement and commission amortization   funds from operations   the increase in income before net gains from to resulted principally from a million increase in property operating income which is defined as rental and other income less property operating expenses and real estate taxes  offset by increases in interest and depreciation expense 
the increase in interest expense of million was due primarily to debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of properties 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  reflecting the greater number of properties owned 
additionally  general and administrative costs increased by million  primarily reflecting higher personnel costs 
the change in ffo  when compared to  is attributable to the same factors that affected income before net gains in such periods  excluding the effect of changes in depreciation and amortization expense 
the change in property operating income from to reflects improved results from comparable properties which is defined as properties owned throughout both and  as well as the effect of the sale and acquisition of properties  as detailed below 
income growth from comparable properties is largely due to improved performance from the trust s comparable office properties  which generally experienced lower vacancy and slightly higher rental rates  offset in part by increased operating expenses

the increase in office property operating income relating to new england properties was primarily due to the portland square acquisition  which contributed million to the net change 
the increase in the retail segment was largely due to the contribution of bradlees  inc s store in peabody  massachusetts  which began paying rent in november following the affirmation of its lease under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
the primary factor in the decline in property operating income from industrial properties located outside new england was a decrease from an overall leased rate at november  to an overall leased rate at november  higher revenues from the non new england office buildings contributed to the increase in office properties operating income 
the decrease in operating income from to in the multifamily segment is largely due to the sale of the posada del rey apartments in metairie  louisiana in september the decrease in property operating income from the non new england other properties was directly related to the sale of a partnership interest in a san bruno  california apartment complex

the increase in income before net gains and ffo from to resulted principally from an increase in property operating income 
the change in property operating income reflects improved results from properties owned throughout both and  as well as the effect of the sale and acquisition of properties as detailed below net change and comparable properties  and acquisitions  and sales  total  the change in operating income with respect to each of the property types generally derives from the trust s pattern of acquisitions and sales  as detailed below property type net change industrial  office research and development  office  multifamily  retail  other land and partnership  total  the income growth in the office research and development segment was primarily due to acquisitions completed during and these properties were near or at occupancy throughout the increase in the property income in the office segment reflects million from the acquisitions and a million increase generated from the comparable properties 
the acquisitions of office properties totaled  square feet and brought the trust s office portfolio to  square feet at november  the increase in operating income from comparable office properties was due to an improvement in occupancy and  to a lesser extent  rental rates 
the change in the multifamily segment reflects improved results from comparable properties offset by the effect of property sales in and the comparable properties experienced a increase in revenue  principally from an increase in rental rates  while operating expenses were relatively unchanged from this resulted in an increase in operating income of million from to which was offset by the loss of income of million from properties sold 
the trust s interest in a metairie  louisiana apartment complex  which was sold in september for million  had generated million of operating income for the ten months it was owned during operating income in the retail segment decreased slightly in due to charges associated with tenant terminations 
the trust executed leases relating to  square feet of commercial space during also contributing to the change in income before net gains and ffo is an increase in interest income from to  which was due generally to higher interest rates on short term investments during depreciation expense increased due to the increase in the number of properties owned

at november  financial liquidity was provided by million in cash and cash equivalents and by million available under lines of credit aggregating million 
the principal sources and uses of cash in are summarized as follows 
the portland square acquisition was acquired subject to million of existing mortgage debt which is not included in the following table sources of cash trust operations  sales of real estate  net  new borrowings  net of fees  prepayments and amortization  total  uses of cash real estate acquisitions  dividends  additions to real estate  other  total  mortgage loans payable totaled million at november   a net increase of million from million at november  the change represents a combination of the addition of three mortgage loans totaling million  the million of debt associated with the portland square acquisition and additional draws totaling million under lines of credit which  in the aggregate  were offset by scheduled loan repayments totaling million 
scheduled loan repayments due during total million 
mgi believes it will continue to be able to extend or refinance maturing mortgage loans upon satisfactory terms 
additional cash requirements in will include distributions to shareholders  capital and tenant improvements and leasing expenditures 
during  expenditures for capital and tenant improvements totaled million and million  respectively 
included in the amount for capital improvements are million of costs associated with building renovations 
during  budgeted renovation costs are anticipated to aggregate million 
additionally  the trust has estimated that recurring capital expenditures in will total million  including million which pertains to interior and exterior improvements of its multifamily complexes and million for its commercial properties 
tenant improvements relating to anticipated leasing activity are budgeted at million in in december  mgi acquired for million two flex buildings  which are leased 
the acquisition completed a tax deferred exchange 
in addition  mgi entered into an agreement to refinance the existing million  loan secured by its investment in one portland square and an adjacent parking lot in portland  maine  with an million  fixed rate non recourse loan bearing interest at a rate of and having a term of years 
in connection with the repayment of the existing loan  a prepayment fee of million will be incurred upon completion of the refinancing 
sources of funds in the future are expected to be from property operations  mortgaging or refinancing of existing mortgages on properties  borrowing under mgi s lines of credit and mgi s portfolio of investment securities 
other potential sources of funds include the proceeds of public or private offerings of additional equity or debt securities or the sale of real estate investments 
it is presently anticipated that the purchase of additional properties in will be primarily financed by debt and  to a lesser extent  by cash flow from operations  short term investments and the proceeds  if any  from the sale of real estate or of equity and debt securities 
mgi believes the combination of available cash and cash equivalents  the value of mgi s unencumbered properties and other resources are sufficient to meet its short and long term liquidity requirements 
other during the past three years  the impact of inflation on mgi s operations and investment activity has not been significant 
real estate investments and operations are subject to a number of factors  including changes in general economic climate  local conditions such as an oversupply of space  a decline in effective rents or a reduction in the demand for real estate  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance or to fund capital and tenant improvements required to maintain market position and control of operating costs 
in certain markets in which the trust owns real estate  overbuilding and local or national economic conditions have  in the past  combined to produce lower effective rents and or longer absorption periods for vacant space 
as the trust re leases space  certain effective rents may be less than those earned previously 
management believes its modest diversification by region and property type and its diverse tenant base somewhat reduce the risks associated with these factors and enhances opportunities for cash flow growth and capital gains potential  although there can be no assurance thereof 
new accounting pronouncements effective december   the trust will adopt sfas no 
and  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting for stock based compensation
