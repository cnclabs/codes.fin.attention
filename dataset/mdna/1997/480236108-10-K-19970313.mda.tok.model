item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results in future periods may differ significantly from the results discussed in or anticipated by such forward looking statements 
certain factors which may impact results for future periods are discussed below under the captions overview and risks and uncertainties 
overview the company was founded in to market and distribute specialty pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements 
the company has achieved significant increases in sales and net income through acquisitions of products and businesses to complement or expand the company s business and to add selected manufacturing capacity to support certain product lines 
at december   the company had completed such acquisitions of which four were completed in the preceding months  including the daniels acquisition in august which is treated as a pooling of interests for accounting and reporting purposes and the acquisition of abana and the addition of its person physician oriented sales force on december  in addition to the significant revenue growth derived from acquisition activity  the company pursues internal growth initiatives to develop marketing opportunities with respect to the acquired product lines and businesses 
sales and net income have increased from million and million in  respectively  to million and million in  respectively  representing five year compounded annual growth rates of approximately in sales and in net income 
sales are reported net of returns  rebates and discounts during the period in which product is shipped 
product rebates and discounts are incurred due to volume or other contractual allowances on certain pharmaceutical sales under contracts with hospitals  buying groups and managed care organizations 
as of december  and  the company maintained reserves of million for unclaimed but anticipated rebates and discounts 
product returns  pursuant to operating policies with respect to unused pharmaceuticals and pursuant to a limited money back refund policy applicable to nutritional supplements sold to consumers  are less than of gross annual sales 
return policies applicable to daniels products were revised effective december   to conform to other pharmaceuticals having lower rates of product return 
sales are reflected prior to royalties due on sales of certain pharmaceuticals arising from product line acquisitions 
such royalties are recorded as a selling expense 
royalty arrangements typically extend for a fixed period from the date of acquisition and do not require minimum payments to maintain ownership or any rights to products 
during the year ending december   sales were million comprised of million of pharmaceutical sales and million of nutritional supplement sales 
the relative contributions of pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements to the company s sales can be influenced by acquisition activity in each product category as well as by marketing activity  customer demand and product availability 
in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  sales of certain of its thrombin based hemostats were adversely impacted by supply difficulties 
in august the company acquired domestic rights to the brevital pharmaceutical line for million and a year royalty of on net sales of brevital 
sales of brevital represented approximately of total company sales during the last four months of and approximately of sales 
in march the company acquired domestic rights to the tapazole pharmaceutical line for million and a year royalty of on net sales of tapazole 
sales of tapazole for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition represented approximately of total company sales for the full year 
the company s strategy for continued growth is materially dependent upon its continued ability to acquire  by purchase or exclusive license arrangements  niche market pharmaceuticals which can be promoted through existing marketing and distribution channels 
the company also intends to market aggressively the principal products in its current portfolio together with new formats or formulations of existing products and  when appropriate  to enhance its marketing and distribution channels 
in pursuing its acquisition strategy  the company relies to a significant degree upon the availability of product lines subject to divestiture or sale by other manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire rights to additional products on acceptable terms  if at all  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s rate of growth and on its business and financial conditions and results of operations 
the success of the company s efforts in managing its existing business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors which may affect the company include its dependence upon a limited number of key pharmaceuticals  the company s ability to integrate new product acquisitions and to adapt and expand its marketing capabilities to the needs of such products  and its reliance upon third party manufacturers to produce certain key products 
the company s operations and growth will also be influenced by regulatory and governmental policies and by competitive forces within the pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
the following table sets forth certain data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
percentage of sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit on sales selling  general administrative expenses non recurring merger expense operating income other income expenses interest income interest expense other miscellaneous income expenses income before income tax net income transaction costs and other non recurring expenses arising in connection with the daniels acquisition and charged against operating income in accordance with pooling of interests accounting treatment 
in the absence of such charges  operating income would have been of net sales and income before tax and net income would have increased to and  respectively

during the company received net proceeds of approximately million through an underwritten offering and sale of  shares of common stock to provide funding for debt repayment and acquisition purposes 
approximately million of such proceeds remain available for acquisition and working capital purposes following debt retirement of million  payment of million in connection with the acquisition of tapazole  and cash payments of approximatley million in connection with dissenters rights of minority holders in the daniels acquisition 
also during  the company issued approximately million shares having a market value of approximately million at date of issuance in connection with the daniels acquisition and approximately  shares having a market value of approximately million at date of issuance in connection with the acquisition of abana 
at december  and  respectively  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects the unapplied proceeds from the sale of additional stock and cash flow from operations  net of debt repayment and capital investments 
the company believes that available resources and anticipated cash flow from operations are adequate to meet currently anticipated operating needs and acquisition program 
while the company does not maintain current lines of credit  it believes it has sufficient borrowing capacity in the event that acquisition opportunities cannot be funded from existing resources 
total assets increased million to million at december  from million at december  and total liabilities decreased million to million at december  from million at december  intangible assets  principally licenses  trademarks and goodwill associated with acquired products  increased million  net of amortization charges during the year  to million at december   primarily as a result of the acquisition of the tapazole rights in march and the acquistion of abana on december  intangible assets as a percent of shareholders equity declined from at december  to at december  inventories declined  to million at december   from million at december  as a result of higher inventory turns 
accounts receivable increased to million at december   from million at december   due to higher fourth quarter sale in in days outstanding  however  accounts receivable decreased to days at december  from days at december  net property plant and equipment increased by million to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to expansion of the company s gentrac and daniels manufacturing capacities during as of december   the company is indebted to lilly in the principal amount of million bearing interest at 
this indebtedness  incurred in connection with the acquisition of the brevital product line  is due in august the company has experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
while the company has passed some price increases along to customers  the company has primarily benefitted from rapid sales growth  negating most inflationary pressures 
the company s manufacturing operations are not capital intensive and  as such  the impact of inflation on the property  plant and equipment and associated depreciation expense of the company has been minimal 
recent accounting pronouncements during the company adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the adoption of these statements did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
risks and uncertainties the future results of operations  both annually and from quarter to quarter  are subject to a variety of factors applicable to the company and to the industries and markets in which it operates 
in addition to factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report  the following should be considered 
new marketing directions arising from recent acquisitions 
as a result of the company s acquisitions during  it currently derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of pharmaceuticals which are marketed primarily by sales and promotional activities directed to office based prescribing physicians 
prior to these developments  the company s pharmaceutical marketing efforts focused on critical care products and were directed toward hospital pharmacies 
the company has significantly expanded its pharmaceutical marketing staff particularly as the result of the acquisition of abana and its person sales force at year end 
the company has only limited experience to date in the marketing of prescription oriented pharmaceuticals and its ability to maintain or increase sales levels for these products is materially dependent upon its ability to understand and adapt to the needs of this market and to integrate successfully the abana sales force 
dependence upon key pharmaceutical products 
the company s recent significant growth in revenues and earnings is primarily attributable to its acquisitions of a limited number of key pharmaceuticals with higher gross margins 
during the sales of four products  tapazole  levoxyl  brevital and jmi thrombin represented  in the aggregate  approximately of total sales 
any factor adversely affecting either the availability of or the market for any of such products would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product pricing constraints and adjustments 
in addition to other competitive factors  the ability of the company to maintain or increase profit margins for pharmaceuticals depends in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement to the company s customers and patients from third party health care payors  such as governments  private insurors and managed care organizations 
policies adopted by third party payors influence the pricing of medical services and products 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available for the company s products or that such third party reimbursement will be adequate 
moreover  under contracts with hospitals and buying groups applicable to the sale of many of the company s pharmaceuticals  final sales prices to distributors may be subject to retroactive adjustment based upon volume or other contractual discounts provided by the company 
while the company believes that it has adequate reserves to cover such adjustments  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience price adjustments in the future that significantly exceed such reserves 
regulation and product risks 
the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  advertising and sampling of the company s products are subject to extensive regulations by various federal and state agencies  including the fda  the ftc  the dea  the consumer product safety commission  the department of agriculture  the united states postal service and the epa 
in addition to other costs of compliance with such regulations  the company is subject to possible risks arising from changes in such regulations or based upon alleged violations of regulations 
such risks could render products unavailable or unmarketable or result in product recalls 
any such development could materially and adversely affect the company s reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to government regulation  the company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event use of a product is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects for a patient or consumer 
such risk exists even with respect to those products which are manufactured in regulated facilities or otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
while the company has taken  and continues to take  what it believes are appropriate precautions  there can be no assurance that it will avoid significant product liability exposure 
the company currently has product liability insurance in the amount of million per claim and million in the aggregate and excess coverage of million through an umbrella policy  however  there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover potential claims or that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
a product liability claim could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on third party manufacturers 
the company has historically relied on third party manufacturers to produce many of its products and currently relies upon third party manufacturers for production of brevital and tapazole  each of which is a key pharmaceutical 
although such products are subject to long term manufacturing arrangements with reliable and substantial entities  alternative sources are not readily available and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain adequate supplies of such products in a timely fashion  or at all 
disruption in the available supply of brevital or of tapazole or the inability of the company to find obtain sources of supply upon the expiration of current contracts would be materially adverse to the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
competition 
many of the company s competitors  both in the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals and in the marketing and distribution of nutritional supplements  have considerably greater financial  sales  marketing and technical resources than those of the company 
in addition  many of the company s present competitors have extensive research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with the company s products 
technological advances affecting the cost of production as well as marketing or pricing action by one or more of the competitors could also materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
