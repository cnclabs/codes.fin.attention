during the first half of  the yen strengthened substantially versus the dollar 
in the third quarter of  the yen began to weaken in relation to the dollar and continued to weaken throughout the average yen to dollar exchange rates were in  in and in operating earnings per share  which were exh affected by the fluctuations in the value of the yen  increased to in  to in and to in the weakening of the yen in lowered operating earnings by approximately 
per share in compared with  and the strengthening of the yen in and benefited operating earnings by 
per share in compared with and 
per share in compared with these per share amounts were solely attributable to the translation effect of the fluctuations in the yen and not to any fundamental change in business operations 
the company sets its growth objective for operating earnings per share before the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
excluding the effect of currency fluctuations  operating earnings per share increased  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the goal for was growth in operating earnings per share excluding the effect of foreign currency translation 
in the fourth quarter of  the company raised its primary financial objective for through from annual growth in operating earnings per share to  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation 
the following table illustrates the effect of foreign currency translation on the company s reported results by comparing those results as if foreign currency rates had remained unchanged 
in years when the yen weakens  translating yen into dollars causes smaller increases or negative percentage changes for financial results in dollars 
when the yen strengthens  translating yen into dollars causes larger increases for financial results in dollars 
supplemental consolidated data selected percentage changes years ended december  adjusted to as exclude foreign reported currency changes premium income net investment income

operating earnings per share amounts excluding foreign currency changes for each year shown above were determined using the average yen dollar exchange rate for each respective prior year 
includes the gain from the sale of the television station in excludes realized investment gains losses and  in  the gain on the sale of the television station 
exh the company s objective for is to increase operating earnings per share by excluding the effect of currency translation 
however  if that objective is achieved and the yen dollar exchange rate averages compared with the average rate of  operating earnings per share including foreign currency translation would increase by approximately in despite the weakening of the yen during  operating earnings per share increased in each year of the three year period ended december  the increases reflected strong earnings in the functional currencies of aflac s core insurance operations in japan and the united states  improved operating earnings by the aflac broadcast division  and a consolidated benefit from additional investment income associated with profit repatriations from aflac japan to aflac us partially offsetting the increases were higher corporate expenses and increased interest expense associated with the company s share repurchase program 
however  the share repurchase program benefited earnings per share 
profit repatriation aflac japan repatriated profits to aflac us of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in the profit transfers to aflac us adversely impact aflac japan s investment income 
however  profit repatriations benefit aflac us investment income and consolidated operations because higher investment yields can be obtained on funds invested in the united states 
also  income tax expense is presently lower on investment income earned in the united states 
management estimates that cumulative profit transfers from through have benefited consolidated net earnings by million in  million in and million in repatriated profits represent a portion of the after tax earnings reported to the japanese ministry of finance as of march each year 
such regulatory basis earnings are based on accounting principles that differ materially from generally accepted accounting principles 
such differences relate primarily to valuation of investments  policy benefit and claim reserves  acquisition costs and deferred income taxes 
japanese regulatory earnings and related profit repatriations may therefore vary materially from year to year because of these differences 
management currently expects that the profit repatriation amount will fall between the amounts transferred in and share repurchase program during  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional million shares of aflac incorporated common stock 
including shares remaining under a previous authorization  the company had approval to purchase up to million shares as of december  the company had purchased million shares from the inception of the plan in february through december  the difference in the percentage increases of net earnings and net earnings per share primarily reflects the impact of the share repurchase program 
the shares purchased were financed with available cash and bank borrowings 
interest expense related to the share repurchase program was million in  million in and million in consolidated interest expense  including interest expense from insurance exh operations  was million in  million in and million in income taxes the company s effective income tax rates were in  and in both and japanese income taxes on aflac japan s operating results  which were taxed at japan s corporate income tax rate of  made up most of the company s income tax expense 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in resulted from changes in the contributions from the company s business components  primarily the gain on the sale of the television station 
insurance operations  aflac japan aflac japan  a branch of aflac and the principal contributor to the company s earnings  ranks number one in terms of premium income and profits among all foreign life and non life insurance companies operating in japan 
among all life insurance companies operating in japan  aflac japan ranks fourth in terms of individual policies in force and th in terms of assets 
the transfer of profits from aflac japan to aflac us distorts comparisons of operating results between years 
therefore  the aflac japan summary of operations table on the following page presents investment income  total revenues and pretax operating earnings calculated on a pro forma basis in order to improve comparability between years

exh japan sales the percentage increases in premium income in yen reflect the growth of premiums in force 
the increases in annualized premiums in force of in  in and in reflect the high persistency of our business  premium rate increases during the last three years  sales of new policies  and conversions of existing policies to policies with higher benefits and premiums 
new annualized premiums from sales and conversions were million in  down up in yen  million in  up in yen  and million in  up in yen 
sales growth  excluding conversions  has been positively affected by product broadening 
aflac japan s sales mix is changing  although cancer insurance still accounts for the majority of insurance in force 
cancer insurance sales accounted for of total new sales in yen in  in and in sales of aflac japan s living benefit life product were very strong in living benefit life  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of  accounted for of total new sales in care product sales represented of total new sales in  in and in management believes that the sale of newly introduced products will continue to be important to aflac japan s new sales growth 
japan investments due to the continued low level of available investment yields in japan  the ministry of finance has required insurers to increase premium rates on new policy issues in recent years 
aflac japan increased premium rates by an average of on all cancer policy sales made after july  premium rates on new care policy issues were increased by an average of in september as a result of continuing low yields  the company increased premium rates by approximately on all new policy issues beginning in the fourth quarter of investment income  which is affected by available cash flow from operations and investment yields achievable on new investments  continually increased in and  despite a general decline in available investment yields 
investment income declined in due to the weaker yen increased in yen 
funds available for investment during the three year period through were reduced by the annual profit repatriations previously discussed and expenditures of million in for the final construction phase of the administrative office building in tokyo 
rates of return on fixed maturity securities in japan remained low in compared with historical levels 
for instance  the yield on year japanese government bonds  as measured by a composite index  declined from a high of in february to a low of in november  closing the year at 
aflac japan s new money rates for investments were for  for and for the cumulative effect of lower investment yields is reflected in the overall rate of return net of investment expenses on aflac japan s average invested assets  at amortized cost 
this return was in  compared with in and in for aflac japan  the duration of policy benefit liabilities is longer than that of the related assets 
therefore  there is a risk that reinvestment of the proceeds at maturity of such investments will be at a exh yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy liabilities 
at december   the average duration of the policy liabilities was approximately years  unchanged from the average duration of the yen denominated invested assets was approximately nine years in both and the weighted average period to maturity of fixed maturity securities at december   was years  compared with years at december  over the next five years  billion  at amortized cost  or  of aflac japan s fixed maturity securities are scheduled to mature 
by concentrating on selected sectors  aflac japan has secured higher yields than year japanese government bonds would have provided while still adhering to conservative standards for credit quality 
management believes that it can maintain an overall return on invested assets with an adequate spread over premium pricing assumptions and assumed interest rates for policy liabilities for the near term 
the premium increases implemented during the past three years will have a positive impact on these spreads and therefore contribute to stability in the pretax operating profit margin 
japan deregulation in december  the governments of the united states and japan reached an agreement on deregulation of the japanese insurance industry 
the agreement calls for the gradual liberalization of the industry over the next four years and includes provisions to avoid radical change in the third sector of the insurance industry 
aflac and other foreign owned insurers  as well as some small to medium sized japanese insurers  operate primarily in the third sector 
one of the measures for avoiding radical change in the third sector is the prohibition of additional japanese life and non life insurance companies from selling cancer or medical insurance until january  japan other during the three year period ended december   the benefit ratio and the operating expense ratio have been stable 
annual claims experience and persistency studies continue to support the current reserving assumptions 
in  the japanese government passed a package of tax reform bills centering on an increase in the consumption tax  which is similar to a sales tax in the united states 
the consumption tax is scheduled to increase from the current rate of to effective april  aflac japan currently incurs consumption tax on agents commissions 
had the rate increase been enacted effective january   pretax operating earnings would have been reduced by approximately million million after income tax in in late  the japanese government proposed new income tax provisions that would increase japan s income taxes on investment income received by foreign companies operating in japan from securities issued from their home country 
the government plans to finalize the proposal in march the new provisions are expected to be effective beginning in if the proposal had been enacted in in its present form  aflac japan s income tax expense would have been increased  and net earnings of the company would have decreased by approximately million for the year exh management is evaluating the impact of this proposal and will seek to mitigate much of the tax impact through investment alternatives and by restructuring portions of the existing investment portfolio 
based on a preliminary review  management does not expect this tax change as it is presently proposed to materially affect future net earnings of the company 
even with japan s economic slowdown  the company believes the market for supplemental insurance remains bright 
demand for the company s products in japan has continued  and the company remains optimistic about increasing penetration within existing groups  selling new products  opening new accounts and developing additional supplemental products for the japanese market 
insurance operations  aflac us aflac us pretax operating earnings continued to benefit from additional investment income earned on profit transfers received from aflac japan 
aflac us received profit transfers in the amounts of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in aflac us in turn increased dividend payments to the parent company in the amounts of million in  million in  million in and million in estimated investment income earned from profits repatriated to and retained by aflac us from through has been reclassified in the presentation on the following page in order to improve comparability between years

the increases in annualized premiums in force of in  in and in were favorably affected by an improvement in the persistency for several lines of business and increased sales at the work site through cafeteria plans internal revenue code section 
exh new annualized premiums from sales and policy conversions were million in  up  million in  up  and million in  up 
product lines developed since have contributed greatly to new sales growth  accounting for of total sales in us other management expects the operating expense ratio  excluding discretionary advertising expenses  to decline in the future due to continued improvements in operating efficiencies 
by improving administrative systems and controlling other costs  management has been able to redirect funds to a national advertising program without significantly affecting the operating expense ratio 
for more information regarding advertising expenses  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at the same time  the operating results continue to reflect relatively stable benefit ratios 
management expects future benefit ratios for some of the company s supplemental products to increase slightly due to the company s ongoing efforts to improve policy persistency by enhancing policyholder benefits 
in addition  potential minimum benefit ratio requirements by insurance regulators may also result in an increase to these ratios 
however  the aggregate benefit ratio has been relatively stable due to the mix of business shifting towards accident and hospital indemnity policies  which have lower benefit ratios than other products 
management expects the pretax operating profit margin  which was excluding the effect of repatriation in  to remain approximately the same in management continues to believe that there are significant opportunities to market high quality  affordable supplemental insurance products in the us marketplace 
broadcast operations the company s broadcast operations include seven network affiliated television stations located in small to mid size us markets 
broadcast revenues increased in and in primarily due to increased advertising revenues from an improved us economy and from the political elections in as previously mentioned  the company entered into definitive agreements during for the sale of its broadcast division business 
the sale of one station  wafb tv in baton rouge  louisiana  closed on december  management expects the sale of the remaining six stations will close during the first half of other operations the parent company s operating expenses consist primarily of corporate overhead expenses such as salary costs  retirement provisions  professional fees and litigation expenses 
these expenses have increased in recent years  principally due to the growth in corporate service activities  exh changes in the legal environment in certain states  and to greater retirement accruals for certain senior officers and beneficiaries due to enhanced benefits  early retirements and revisions in actuarial assumptions 
other operations include minor insurance operations in taiwan and canada 
as of december   the company was in the process of selling its canadian operation 
additional expense charges were recognized in for estimated termination costs and fair value adjustments related to these operations

analysis of financial condition balance sheet during the last two years  the financial condition of the company has remained strong in the functional currencies of its operations 
the investment portfolios of aflac japan and aflac us have continued to grow and consist of high quality securities 
due to the relative size of aflac japan  changes in the yen dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on the company s financial statements 
the yen dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to convert yen denominated balance sheet items to us dollars for reporting purposes 
the exchange rate at december   was yen to one us dollar  weaker than the december   exchange rate of 
management estimates that the weaker yen rate decreased invested assets  including cash  by billion  total assets by billion and total liabilities by billion compared with the amounts that would have been reported using the previous year end exchange rate

in addition  aflac us received million in cash in conjunction with the sale of a television station on december  offsetting these positive factors was a decrease in unrealized investment gains due in part to the weaker yen dollar exchange rate 
net unrealized gains of billion on investments in fixed maturity securities at december   consisted of billion in gross unrealized gains and million in gross unrealized losses 
exh aflac invests primarily within the japanese and us fixed maturity markets 
the company uses specific criteria to judge the credit quality and liquidity of its investments and utilizes a variety of credit rating services to monitor this criteria

at december   borrowings of billion yen million were outstanding under this agreement

exh policyholder protection funds under insurance guaranty fund laws in most us states  insurance companies doing business in those states can be assessed for policyholder losses up to prescribed limits that are incurred by insolvent companies with similar lines of business 
such assessments have not been material to the company in the past 
the company believes that future assessments relating to companies currently involved in insolvency proceedings will not materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
the life insurance association of japan  an industry organization  is currently implementing a policyholder protection fund 
the purpose of the fund is to provide capital support to member companies for business assumed from insolvent life insurers 
aflac japan has pledged investment securities to the life insurance association of japan for this program 
the company retains ownership of the securities and receives the related investment income 
the amount of securities pledged is based on premium income and policy reserves 
as of december   million  at fair value  of aflac japan s investment securities had been pledged to this fund 
shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased million from december   to december  this was primarily due to a decrease in net unrealized gains on securities available for sale of million  net treasury stock purchases of million and dividends paid of million 
offsetting these decreases were net earnings of million and an increase in unrealized foreign exchange gains of million 
the company s insurance operations continue to provide its primary sources of liquidity 
capital needs can also be supplemented by borrowed funds 
the principal sources of cash from insurance operations are premiums and investment income 
primary uses of cash in the insurance operations are policy claims  commissions  operating expenses  income taxes and payments to the parent company for management fees and dividends 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable 
the company s investment objectives provide for liquidity through the ownership of high quality investment securities 
aflac insurance policies are generally not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
also  the majority of aflac policies provide indemnity benefits rather than reimbursement for actual medical costs and therefore are not subject to the increasing risks of medical cost inflation 
the achievement of continued long term growth will require growth in aflac s statutory capital and surplus 
aflac may secure additional statutory capital through various sources  such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings 
the disposition of the aflac broadcast division will increase the company s capital resources upon closing of the transaction 
management believes outside sources for additional debt and equity capital  if needed  will continue to be available for capital expenditures and business expansion 
parent company capital resources are largely dependent upon the ability of the subsidiaries to pay management fees and dividends 
the georgia insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on exh payments of dividends  management fees  loans and advances by aflac to the parent company 
the georgia insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of statutory earnings for the previous year or of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end 
in addition  the georgia insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group 
these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to the parent company 
a life insurance company s statutory capital and surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  as modified by the insurance company s state of domicile 
statutory accounting rules are different from generally accepted accounting principles and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency 
currently  prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the naic is in the process of recodifying sap to promote standardization throughout the industry 
completion of this project will result in changes in statutory accounting practices for the company 
the impact on the company s statutory capital and surplus is not presently determinable 
a risk based capital formula that establishes capital requirements relating to insurance risk  business risk  asset risk and interest rate risk was adopted by the naic in for us life insurance companies 
these requirements are intended to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer s operations 
aflac s naic risk based capital ratio continues to reflect a very strong capital and surplus position 
also  there are various ongoing regulatory initiatives by the naic relating to investments  reinsurance  limited benefit insurance policies  dividend restrictions  revisions to the risk based capital formula and other related matters 
in addition to restrictions by us insurance regulators  the japanese ministry of finance mof imposes restrictions on and requires approval for the remittances of earnings from aflac japan to aflac us payments are made from aflac japan to the parent company for management fees and to aflac us for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings 
total funds received from aflac japan were million in  million in and million in during the last few years  the mof has developed solvency standards  a version of risk based capital requirements 
for additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends  profit transfers and other remittances  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

for additional information  reference should be made to the consolidated statements of cash flows on pages and operating activities in  consolidated cash flow from operations decreased to billion  compared with billion in and billion in net cash flow from operations for aflac japan decreased to billion in  compared with billion in and billion in aflac japan represented of the consolidated net cash flow from operations in  in and in the decrease in cash flow from operations in was due to the weaker yen 
cash flow from operations in was favorably affected by an acceleration of remittances from premium collection agencies to aflac japan in the amount of million 
this cash flow change did not affect premium income 
investing activities consolidated cash flow used by investing activities decreased to billion in  compared with billion in and billion in the sale of one television station in generated million in cash flow 
aflac japan accounted for of the consolidated net cash used by investing activities in  compared with in and in included in aflac japan s portion for were expenditures of million for the final construction phase of an administrative office building in tokyo 
operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase high quality fixed maturity securities 
when market opportunities arise  the company disposes of certain fixed maturity securities to improve future investment yields or lengthen maturities by reinvesting in securities of similar or higher quality 
therefore  dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year
