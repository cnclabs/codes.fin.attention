the major markets in which the company sells its principal products are highly competitive 
its products compete with similar products manufactured by others and  in some instances  with products manufactured from other materials 
areas of competition include price  innovation  quality and service 
the company s business is affected by cyclical industry conditions and economic factors such as industry capacity  growth in the economy  interest rates  unemployment levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
wood fiber and recycled fiber  the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products  are purchased in highly competitive  price sensitive markets 
these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality 
in addition  the supply and price of wood fiber in particular  is dependent upon a variety of factors over which the company has no control  including environmental and conservation regulations  natural disasters  such as forest fires and hurricanes  and weather 
the company purchases or cuts a variety of species of timber from which the company utilizes wood fiber depending upon the product being manufactured and each mill s geographic location 
a decrease in the supply of wood fiber has caused  and will likely continue to cause  higher wood fiber costs in some of the regions in which the company procures wood 
in addition  the increase in demand for products manufactured  in whole or in part  from recycled fiber has from time to time caused a tightness in the supply of recycled fiber and at those times a significant increase in the cost of such fiber used in the manufacture of recycled containerboard and related products 
the company s paper and paper packaging products use a large volume of recycled fiber 
while the company has not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining wood fiber and recycled fiber in economic proximity to its mills  there can be no assurances that this will continue to be the case for any or all of its mills 
at december   the company owned approximately thousand and thousand acres of private fee timberland in the united states and canada  respectively 
the company s business is not dependent upon a single customer or upon a small number of major customers

these bodies of water had been used by the company s snowflake  arizona pulp and paperboard mill for the evaporation of its process wastewater 
the company has vigorously disputed the application of the clean water act to these two privately owned evaporation ponds 
the company has implemented a plan to use its wastewater to irrigate a biomass plantation and discontinue using dry lake to evaporate wastewater 
the parties have been negotiating a consent decree to resolve this matter which currently is expected to include civil penalties in the amount of  on october   the florida department of environmental regulation  predecessor to the department of environmental protection dep  filed a civil complaint in the fourteenth judicial circuit court of bay county  florida against the company seeking injunctive relief  an unspecified amount of fines and civil penalties  and other relief based on alleged groundwater contamination at the company s panama city  florida pulp and paperboard mill 
in addition  the complaint alleges operation of a solid waste facility without a permit and discrepancies in hazardous waste shipping manifests 
because of uncertainties in the interpretation and application of dep s rules  it is premature to assess the company s potential liability  if any  in the event of an adverse ruling 
at the parties request  the case has been placed in abeyance pending the conclusion of a related administrative proceeding petitioned by the company in june following dep s proposal to deny the company a permit renewal to continue operating its wastewater pretreatment facility at the mill site 
the administrative proceeding has been referred to a hearing officer for an administrative hearing on the consolidated issues of compliance with a prior consent order  denial of the permit renewal  completion of a contamination assessment and denial of a sodium exemption 
the consolidated cases were abated at the parties request and extensive settlement negotiations are being conducted between the parties 
the company intends to vigorously assert its entitlement to the permit renewal and to defend against the groundwater contamination and unpermitted facility allegations in the event that a settlement cannot be reached 
on april   carolina power light cp l commenced proceedings against the company before the federal energy regulatory commission ferc the ferc proceeding and in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina the federal court action 
both proceedings relate to the company s electric cogeneration facility located at its florence  south carolina mill the facility and the company s electric power purchase agreement the agreement with cp l 
in the ferc proceeding  cp l alleges that the facility lost its qualifying facility qf certification under the public utility regulatory policy act of on august   when the agreement  pursuant to which cp l purchases electricity generated by the facility  was amended to reflect the company s election under the agreement to switch to a buy all sell all mode of operation 
as a result  cp l alleges the company became a public utility on august  subject to ferc regulation under the federal power act 
cp l has also requested that the ferc determine the just and reasonable rate for sales of electric energy and capacity from the facility since august  and to order the company to refund any amounts paid in excess of that rate  plus interest and penalties 
in its answer filed with the ferc on june   the company stated that its power sales to cp l fully complied with the ferc s regulations 
the company also requested that the ferc waive compliance with any applicable ferc regulations in the event that the ferc should determine  contrary to the company s position  that the company has not complied with the ferc s regulations in any respect 
cp l has also filed several other pleadings to which the company has responded 
if the ferc were to determine that the company had become a public utility  the company s issuance of securities and incurrence of debt after the date that it became a public utility could be subject to the jurisdiction and approval of the ferc unless the ferc granted a waiver 
in the absence of such a waiver  certain other activities and contracts of the company after such date could also be subject to additional federal and state regulatory requirements  and defaults might be created under certain existing agreements 
based on past administrative practice of the ferc in granting waivers of certain other regulations  the company believes that it is likely that such a waiver would be granted by the ferc in the event that such a waiver became necessary 
in the federal court action  cp l has requested declaratory judgments that sales of electric energy and capacity under the agreement since august  are subject to a just and reasonable rate to be determined by the ferc and that the agreement has been terminated as a result of the company s failure to maintain the facility s qf status and the invalidity of the agreement s rate provisions 
cp l has also sought damages for breach of contract and for purchases in excess of the just and reasonable rate to be determined by the ferc 
on june   the company moved to dismiss cp l s federal court action on the principal grounds that any proceedings in the united states district court are premature unless and until the ferc proceeding is finally resolved 
on september   the united states district court stayed the federal court action pending the outcome of the ferc proceeding 
the two proceedings are in their preliminary stages and no assurance can be provided as to the timing of the decisions or the outcome of either of them 
the company intends to contest these actions vigorously 
on september   the epa  region iv  issued an administrative order order to the company s panama city mill pursuant to section h of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  usc section h l 
the order required the company to perform a rcra facility investigation at the panama city mill together with confirmatory sampling  interim corrective measures and any other activities necessary to correct alleged actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances or hazardous constituents at or from the panama city mill 
the company filed a protest and requested a hearing to contest the epa s rcra section h jurisdiction over the panama city mill 
the company believes that the panama city mill is not currently a rcra facility 
the corrective measures mandated by the order required the company to conduct extensive groundwater and soil sampling and analyses 
in early the epa issued another order to the mill pursuant to section of rcra section order incorporating certain sampling and analysis activities which the company had proposed in settlement negotiations and requiring additional sampling and analysis 
in its response to the section order the company agreed to implement all of the proposed activities except dioxin sampling 
the parties have been engaged in extensive settlement negotiations with respect to both orders 
the company does not know at this time the likelihood of success in challenging the orders 
notwithstanding the success in challenging the orders  an owner of property adjacent to the panama city mill is currently subject to extensive clean up under rcra  and the epa is empowered to require clean up for materials discharged from the property which may have migrated onto the panama city mill s property 
the company does not yet know the extent  if any  of such adjacent property owner s responsibility to remediate contamination  if any  at the panama city mill site 
on january   the united states of america filed a suit against the company in the united states district court for the district of montana seeking injunctive relief and an unspecified amount in civil penalties based on the alleged failure of the company to comply with certain provisions of the clean air act caa  its implementing regulations  and the montana state implementation plan at the company s missoula  montana kraft pulp mill  the missoula mill 
the complaint specifically alleges that the company exceeded the opacity limitation for recovery boiler emissions  failed to properly set the span on a recovery boiler continuous emissions monitor  and concealed the emission of an air contaminant by improperly venting non condensible gasses 
the statutory penalty for violations of the caa is  per day for each day of violation 
the company has engaged in extensive negotiations with epa and the united states department of justice to settle this matter while vigorously contesting the allegations 
while it is premature to predict the outcome of this matter at this time  negotiators for the company and the united states have reached an agreement in principle to settle this case  which currently is expected to include a penalty of  in a related matter  on november   the company received notice from several environmental groups that they intended to file citizens suits under the caa  the federal water pollution control act cwa and the emergency planning and community right to know act epcra against the company based on alleged violations of those acts at the missoula mill 
in december   representatives of the company met with representatives of the groups that sent the notice to discuss the company s position that the majority of the alleged violations were not in excess of applicable permit limits or were excused because they occurred during reported malfunctions  start up or shutdown conditions 
on january   a complaint was filed by the montana coalition for health  environmental and economic rights inc  cold mountain  cold rivers  inc and native forest network  inc 
collectively plaintiffs in the united states district court for the district of montana alleging numerous violations of the provisions of the caa  the cwa and the epcra 
on february   plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the company has violated section a of the cwa  section a of the caa and section of the epcra  injunctive relief enjoining the company from operating the missoula mill in a manner as will result in further violations of the caa  cwa and epcra  and civil penalties of  per day for each day of alleged violation 
the company has engaged in negotiations with plaintiffs to settle this matter  and in december the parties reached an agreement in principle  which is currently expected to include a penalty of  no assurance can be given that a definitive settlement agreement will be entered into by the parties or approved by the court 
in addition  the registrant is from time to time subject to litigation and governmental proceedings regarding environmental matters in which injunctive and or monetary relief is sought 
the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of sites which are the subject of remedial activity under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla or superfund or comparable state laws 
although the company is subject to joint and several liability imposed under superfund  at most of the multi prp sites there are organized groups of prps and costs are being shared among prps 
the registrant is involved in contractual disputes  administrative and legal proceedings and investigations of various types 
although any litigation  proceeding or investigation has an element of uncertainty  the registrant believes that the outcome of any proceeding  lawsuit or claim which is pending or threatened  or all of them combined  would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity

the company purchases or cuts a variety of species of timber from which the company utilizes wood fiber depending upon the product being manufactured and each mill s geographic location 
a decrease in the supply of wood fiber has caused  and will likely continue to cause  higher wood fiber costs in some of the regions in which the company procures wood

environmental issues the company s operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations 
the company has  in the past  made significant capital expenditures to comply with water  air and solid and hazardous waste regulations and expects to make significant expenditures in the future 
capital expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities were approximately million in  and the company anticipates that and environmental capital expenditures will approximate million and million  respectively 
the majority of the expenditures relate to amounts that the company currently anticipates will be required once final cluster rules described below are adopted 
although capital expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities and compliance costs in future years will depend on legislative and technological developments which cannot be predicted at this time  such costs could increase when final cluster rules are adopted and as other environmental regulations become more stringent 
environmental control expenditures include projects which  in addition to meeting environmental concerns  yield certain benefits to the company in the form of increased capacity and production cost savings 
in addition to capital expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities  other expenditures incurred to maintain environmental regulatory compliance including any remediation represent ongoing costs to the company 
in december  the us environmental protection agency the epa issued a proposed rule affecting the pulp and paper industry 
these proposed regulations  informally known as the cluster rules  would make more stringent requirements for discharge of wastewaters under the clean water act and would impose new requirements on air emissions under the clean air act 
pulp and paper manufacturers including the company have submitted extensive comments to the epa on the proposed regulations in support of the position that requirements under the proposed regulations are unnecessarily complex  burdensome and environmentally unjustified 
estimates  based on currently proposed regulations  indicate that the company could be required to make capital expenditures of million through in order to meet the requirements of the regulations  although it is likely this range will decrease upon finalization of the rules 
while it cannot be predicted with certainty  it appears as though the final cluster rules which are currently expected to be issued in  will be modified to reduce certain requirements 
assuming that the anticipated reduced requirements are promulgated as the company expects  the company currently believes it would be required to make capital expenditures of approximately million during the period of through in order to meet the requirements of the anticipated regulations 
also  additional operating expense will be incurred as capital installations required by the cluster rules are put into service 
such incremental expense will ultimately increase to as much as million per year by the year the ultimate financial impact of the regulations cannot be precisely estimated at this time but will be affected by several factors  including the actual requirements imposed under the final rules  advancements in control process technologies  possible reconfiguration of mills and inflation 
in addition  the company is from time to time subject to litigation and governmental proceedings regarding environmental matters in which injunctive and or monetary relief is sought 
the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of sites which are the subject of remedial activity under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla or superfund or comparable state laws 
although the company is subject to joint and several liability imposed under superfund  at most of the multi prp sites there are organized groups of prps and costs are being shared among prps 
future environmental regulations  including the final cluster rules  may have an unpredictable adverse effect on the company s operations and earnings  but they are not expected to adversely affect the company s competitive position
