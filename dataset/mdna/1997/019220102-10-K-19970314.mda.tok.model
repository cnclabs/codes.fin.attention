regulations the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which they are admitted to transact business 
state insurance laws generally establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers related to granting and revoking licenses to transact business  establishing guaranty fund associations  licensing agents  regulating premium rates for some lines of business  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  and regulating the type and amount of permitted investments 
recently  the insurance regulatory framework has received increased scrutiny from various states  the federal government  and the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
the naic has recommended to the states for adoption and implementation several regulatory initiatives 
none of these is expected to be significant to the company 
california was the source of approximately of the pool s direct written premiums for the past ten years 
proposition  approved by california voters in  provides for a rollback of rates on premiums collected in calendar year to the extent that the insurer s return on equity for each proposition line of business exceeded 
the rollback liability  if any  has not been finalized 
management continues to believe the insurance subsidiaries will not be liable for any material rollback of premiums 
liquidity and capital resources substantial cash inflows for the company are generated from premiums  pool administration fees  investment income  and proceeds from maturities of investments 
the principal outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  and income taxes and the purchase of fixed income and equity securities 
in developing its strategy  the company establishes a level of cash and highly liquid short and intermediate term securities that  combined with expected cash flow  is believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term payment obligations 
in  operating activities generated cash flows of million  in  the total was million  in  the total was million 
for each year  the primary source of funds was premium growth in the property casualty insurance operations 
in each of the years  funds generated from operating activities were primarily used to purchase investment grade fixed income securities  accounting for the majority of cash used in investing activities

in   and  dividends paid on the esop series preferred stock esop series were  million  and million  respectively 
in each year  dividends of million on the series preferred stock were paid 
the increase in dividends to common shareholders and the decrease in esop series were due to the conversion of the esop series completed on march  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the conversion 
prior to the conversion  allied and the esop trustee entered into an agreement whereby allied agrees to release additional shares held by the esop trustee if the dividend paid on common stock is less than per share per quarter  which calculates to per share per quarter on a post split basis 
the agreement is in effect from march  through march  the agreement ensures that the allocated shares in the esop trust receive at least the same amount of dividends that would have been paid on the esop series had they not been converted to common stock 
allied relies primarily on dividends from its insurance subsidiaries to pay preferred and common stock dividends to stockholders 
the iowa state insurance regulations restrict the maximum amount of dividends the property casualty subsidiaries can pay without prior regulatory approval 
the maximum dividend allowed is the greater of either of the subsidiary s statutory capital stock and surplus as of the preceding december or net income of the preceding calendar year 
in the maximum amount legally available for distribution to allied without prior approval is million 
the excess surplus lines subsidiary is domiciled in arizona and operates under arizona state laws 
the maximum amount available for distribution as dividends from the excess surplus lines subsidiary is limited to the lesser of of stockholders surplus as of the preceding december or net investment income of the preceding year 
the excess surplus lines segment could pay million in without prior notice to the insurance commissioner

during and  the property casualty subsidiaries paid allied dividends of million and million  respectively  noninsurance subsidiaries paid dividends of  and million  respectively 
in and  allied also used funds to repurchase million and million of its common stock  respectively 
no shares were repurchased in during  allied repurchased  shares of its common stock on the open market at an average price per share of  which  reflecting the november stock split  was  shares at per share 
pursuant to sec rule b  the board of directors board authorized stock repurchase programs on december  and july   each for  shares  shares on a post split basis 
the stock repurchase program the board approved on december  was completed on july  the stock repurchase program the board approved on july  is not complete   shares remain to be repurchased 
during  allied repurchased  shares  shares on a post split basis of its common stock at an average price per share of on a post split basis under a stock repurchase program the board approved on february   which was completed in november allied s mortgage banking subsidiary  allied group mortgage company allied mortgage  has separate credit agreements to support its operations 
short term and long term notes payable to nonaffiliated companies are used by allied mortgage to finance its mortgage loans held for sale  to purchase servicing rights  and to purchase short term investments 
these notes payable are not guaranteed by allied 
at december   allied mortgage had short term borrowings of million  which are to be repaid through the subsequent sale of its mortgage loan inventory 
the amount of short term borrowings fluctuates daily depending on the level of inventory being financed 
long term borrowings amounted to million to be repaid over the next eight years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of allied mortgage s finance arrangements 
in the normal course of its business  allied mortgage also makes commitments to buy and sell securities that may result in credit and market risk in the event the counterparty is unable to fulfill its obligation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of such commitments 
in  the esop trust issued floating rate notes totaling million esop obligations to acquire esop series stock for the employee stock ownership plan esop 
in march  the esop trust refinanced the notes pursuant to a term credit agreement and guaranty agreement with two separate commercial banks 
allied guaranteed the esop trust s obligations under the agreement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of esop obligations 
at december   the balance of the obligations was million 
contributions plus dividends on leveraged shares held by the esop are used by the esop trust to service the esop obligations 
dividends and payments for the employee lease fees from its subsidiaries are used by allied to fund the amounts paid to the esop trust 
allied made contributions to the esop trust of  in   in  and  in allied paid dividends of million in  million in  and million in  which were used for such debt service 
in connection with its guarantee of esop obligations  allied is required to maintain minimum stockholders equity and to comply with certain other financial covenants 
historically  the insurance subsidiaries have generated sufficient funds from operations to pay their claims 
while the property casualty and excess surplus lines insurance companies have maintained adequate investment liquidity  they have in the past required additional capital contributions to support premium growth 
industry guidelines suggest that a property casualty insurer s annual net written premiums should not exceed approximately of statutory surplus 
at december   the property casualty and excess surplus lines segments net written premiums were and of their statutory surplus  respectively 
management anticipates that short term and long term capital expenditures  cash dividends  and operating cash needs will be met from existing capital and internally generated funds 
in  additional funds of million were generated from the sale of the interest in a savings and loan holding company 
in  the company received an additional  as the final payment on that sale 
the payment represents the company s share of the contingent purchase price that was distributed when all known claims were settled 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
future debt and stock issuance will be considered as additional capital needs arise 
the method of funding will depend upon financial market conditions 
at its march  meeting  the board of directors approved a first quarter common stock dividend of per share 
the dividend is per share higher than the amount paid in the fourth quarter of insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss adjusting expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses is known 
consequently  the company attempts to anticipate the impact of inflation in establishing premiums 
inflation is implicitly considered in the determination of reserves for losses and loss adjusting expenses since portions of the reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the importance of continually reviewing reserves is even more pronounced in periods of extreme inflation
