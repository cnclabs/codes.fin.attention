the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the company s subsidiaries local currency and the dollar will affect the conversion of such subsidiaries financial results into dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
conversion adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
to date  such adjustments have not been material to the company s financial statements 
a substantial portion of the company s purchases and sales are derived from operations outside the united states 
since the revenues and expenses of the company s foreign operations are generally denominated in local currency  exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the dollar subject the company to currency exchange risks with respect to the results of its foreign operations 
therefore  the company is subject to these risks to the extent it is unable to denominate its purchases or sales in dollars or otherwise shift to its customers or suppliers the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company currently does not engage in currency hedging transactions but may do so in the future 
such fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations
