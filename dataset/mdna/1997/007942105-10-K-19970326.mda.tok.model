item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations overview net income for of million increased million or from the million reported for earnings per share of increased from the reported for earnings in reflected a billion or increase in average managed receivables  and a million or rise in noninterest revenues derived principally from securitized receivables and a million gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships 
the securitization of billion of mortgage and home equity loans in  greater than in  also contributed to the increase in noninterest revenues  as income from personal finance loans mortgage  home equity and auto loans was up million or from credit card securitization activities were affected by the adoption in the third quarter of of a new charge off methodology relating to bankruptcies see asset quality  the upward repricing of interest rates and fees  increases in charge offs and the related impact on reserves  all of which had an approximate million impact earnings increase in  as well as a increase in average securitized receivables 
total other operating expenses excluding the amortization of credit card deferred origination costs  net increased  consistent with the increase in average managed receivables 
thus  the operating expense ratio was for both and asset quality indicators tracked unfavorably  as the total managed charge off rate increased to in from in the day and over delinquency rate on managed receivables increased to at december  from at year end the indicators reflect the new charge off methodology relating to credit card bankruptcies 
without this change  the managed charge off rate and the day and over delinquency rate on managed receivables would have been and  respectively 
the changes in the delinquency and charge off rates from year to year reflect the trend in unsecured consumer credit quality which is being experienced throughout the industry 
this trend is continuing in the first quarter of over the last three years  average managed receivables have grown at a compound annual rate of 
this receivable growth has greatly contributed to higher net income and earnings per share 
a significant component of this receivable growth strategy is the company s continuing efforts to market risk adjusted credit card products  whereby credit cards are issued with lower rates to customers whose credit quality is expected to result in a lower rate of credit losses the risk adjusted pricing strategy 
the company s pricing structure on its credit card products also reflects low introductory credit card rates  which reprice upwards after an introductory period of up to one year 
it is estimated that approximately billion of receivables will reprice upwards in the first quarter of at repricing  most of the receivables on these credit cards will have been securitized  and consequently  the enhanced revenues on those receivables will be recorded primarily as increased noninterest revenues securitization income 
although this will not affect the owned net interest margin  it is expected that it will positively impact the managed net interest margin 
net income for of million increased million or from the million reported for earnings per share of increased from the reported for earnings grew in primarily as a result of a increase in average managed receivables  from billion in to billion in  partially offset by an approximate contraction in the managed net interest margin 
noninterest revenues of million in increased million or from million in this increase was primarily due to a increase in average securitized receivables 
the operating expense ratio decreased to in from in the total managed charge off rate for fell to from in on march   the company announced that it expects to report results well below previous expectations 
the company stated it expects to report a loss in the area of million  or approximately cents per share  for the first quarter  and to report net profit for full year of approximately per share 
this interruption in the company s historical pattern of strong financial results reflects a number of factors  including continuing increases in consumer bankruptcies and charge offs and lower receivable balances than originally anticipated in its credit card business 
the company s mortgage financing  leasing and insurance businesses continue to perform well 
in addition to considering other strategic alternatives with its financial and other advisors  the company is pursuing a number of steps to return the company to its historical levels of financial performance by increasing revenues and stemming credit card losses 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including but not limited to projections of future earnings  that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
the most significant among these risks and uncertainties are the company s managed net interest margin  which in turn is affected by the company s success in originating new credit card accounts  the receivables volume and initial pricing of new accounts  the impact of repricing existing accounts and account attrition  the mix of account types and interest rate fluctuations  the level of delinquencies and charge offs  and the level of expenses 
earnings also may be affected by factors that affect consumer debt  competitive pressures and the ratings on debt of the company and its subsidiaries 
additional risks that may affect the company s future performance are detailed elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
net interest income net interest income represents the excess of income generated from interest earning assets  including on balance sheet receivables  investments and money market instruments over the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and debt

credit card  personal finance  and business loan and lease receivable securitization activity shifts revenues from interest income to noninterest revenues 
this ongoing securitization activity reduces the level of higher yielding receivables on the balance sheet while proportionately increasing the balance sheet levels of new lower yielding receivables and money market assets 
net interest income on securitized credit card balances is reflected in credit card securitization income 
net interest income on securitized mortgage and other personal finance loans is reflected in income from personal finance activities  and net interest income on securitized business loans and leases is reflected in business loan and lease other revenues 
all securitization income is included in noninterest revenues

asset liability management the financial condition of advanta corp 
is managed with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards  disciplined interest rate risk management and prudent levels of leverage and liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity refers to net interest income variability resulting from mismatches between asset and liability indices basis risk and the effects which changes in market interest rates have on asset and liability repricing mismatches gap risk 
the company attempts to minimize the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income by regularly evaluating the risk inherent in its asset and liability structure  including securitized assets 
this risk arises from continuous changes in the company s asset liability mix  market interest rates  the yield curve  prepayment trends and the timing of cash flows 
computer simulations are used to evaluate net interest income volatility under varying rate  spread and volume projections over monthly time periods of up to two years 
in managing its interest rate sensitivity position  the company periodically securitizes receivables  sells and purchases assets  alters the mix and term structure of its funding base  changes its investment portfolio and short term investment position  and uses derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and create match funding of assets and liabilities 
derivative financial instruments  by policy  are not used for any speculative purposes see discussion under derivatives activities 
the company has primarily utilized variable rate funding in pricing its credit card securitization transactions in an attempt to match the variable rate pricing dynamics of the underlying receivables sold to the trusts 
variable rate funding is used on the balance sheet as well  in support of unsecuritized receivables which carry variable rates 
although credit card receivable rates are generally set at a spread over a floating rate index  they often contain interest rate floors 
these floors have the impact of converting the credit card receivables to fixed rate receivables in a low interest rate environment 
in addition  the company at times offers fixed rate pricing to consumers for the introductory rate period of its credit cards 
in instances when a significant portion of credit card receivables carry fixed rate introductory pricing or are at their floors  the company may convert part of the underlying funding to a fixed rate by using interest rate hedges  swaps and fixed rate securitizations 
in pricing mortgage and business loan and lease securitizations  both fixed rate and variable rate funding are used depending upon the characteristics of the underlying receivables and the overall interest rate risk exposure to the company 
additionally  basis risk exists in on balance sheet advanta corp 
and subsidiaries funding as well as in securitizing credit card receivables at a spread over the london interbank offered rate libor when the rate on the underlying assets is indexed to the prime rate 
the company measures the basis risk resulting from potential variability in the spread between prime and libor and incorporates such risk into the asset and liability management process 
during  substantially all new credit cards were issued using libor as the repricing index 
the effect of this change is the reduction of prime libor basis risk over time 
the company continues to seek cost effective alternatives for minimizing this risk 
interest rate fluctuations affect net interest income at virtually all financial institutions 
while interest rate volatility does have an effect on net interest income  other factors also contribute significantly to changes in net interest income 
specifically  within the credit card portfolio  pricing decisions and customer behavior regarding convenience usage affect the yield on the portfolio 
these factors may counteract or exacerbate income changes due to fluctuating interest rates 
the company closely monitors interest rate movements  competitor pricing and consumer behavioral changes in its ongoing analysis of net interest income sensitivity 
liquidity  funding and capital resources the company s goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity  both long and short term  through active management of both assets and liabilities 
during  the company  through its subsidiaries  securitized billion of credit card receivables  billion of mortgage and home equity loans and million of business loans and leases 
cash generated from these transactions was temporarily invested in short term  high quality investments at money market rates awaiting redeployment to pay down borrowings and to fund future receivable growth 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows for more information regarding liquidity  funding and capital resources 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental schedules thereto for additional information regarding the company s investment portfolio 
over the last nine years  the company has successfully accessed the securitization market to efficiently support its growth strategy 
while securitization should continue to be a reliable source of funding for the company  other funding sources are available and include deposits  medium term notes  senior and subordinated debt  repurchase agreements  committed and uncommitted bank lines  bank notes  federal funds purchased and the ability to sell assets and raise additional equity

advanta national had total assets of billion at december  funding diversification is an essential component of the company s liquidity management 
the debt securities of advanta corp  advanta national bank usa aus  and anb investment grade ratings from the nationally recognized rating agencies throughout these ratings allowed the company to further diversify its funding sources 
in march  the various rating agencies lowered their ratings on the debt securities of each of advanta corp  aus and anb by one or two grades 
as of march   debt of the two banks  aus and anb  was still rated at or above the lowest level of investment grade by each agency  debt of the parent company  advanta corp  maintained investment grade ratings at or above the lowest investment grade level from three of the rating agencies  but was rated one level below investment grade by standard poors and two levels below investment grade by moody s investors service 
efforts continue to develop new sources of funding  both through previously untapped customer segments and through developing new financing structures 
in august  in a public offering  the company sold  depositary shares each representing a one hundredth interest in a share of stock appreciation income linked securities sails 
the sails constitute a series of the company s class b preferred stock  designated as convertible class b preferred stock  series sails 
on september   unless either previously redeemed by the company or converted at the option of the holder  each share of the sails will automatically convert into shares of class b common stock 
proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting discount  were approximately million 
the company used the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes  including financing the growth of its subsidiaries 
advanta corp

under this program  the banks may issue an aggregate of billion of senior bank notes and million of subordinated bank notes 
these notes may have maturities ranging from seven days to fifteen years from date of issuance

the sole assets of the trust consist of million of junior subordinated debentures issued by the company due december  the junior subordinated debentures 
the capital securities will be subject to mandatory redemption under certain circumstances  including at any time on or after december  upon the optional prepayment by the company of the junior subordinated debentures 
the company has guaranteed the obligations of the trust 
the company used the proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes 
at the advanta parent company level  steady building of liquidity and capital in and was achieved as a result of million of net dividends from subsidiaries in and million in the board of directors currently intends to have the company pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders  maintaining an approximate premium on the dividend paid on the class b common shares  however  the company plans to reinvest the majority of its earnings to support future growth 
in the fourth quarter of  the quarterly dividends on the class a common and class b common shares were raised to

for the fiscal ceba year ended september   aus s average assets did not exceed the allowable amount and  accordingly  aus was in full compliance with ceba growth limits 
however  on september  this growth rate provision of ceba was repealed which has created substantial new flexibility with respect to asset liability management for aus and ultimately the company 
the timing and size of securitizations  on balance sheet liability structure and rapid changes in balance sheet structure have frequently been due to the management of aus s balance sheet within this growth constraint 
as a result of the elimination of this growth restriction  the company is currently evaluating the corporate structure of its two banking subsidiaries 
in addition to aus s total deposits of billion  deposits at december  included million of time deposits at advanta national and million of deposits at advanta financial corp 
afc  a utah state chartered  fdic insured industrial loan corporation 
afc s assets and operations are not currently material to the company  and the company does not expect them to become material in the near term 
while there are no specific capital requirements for advanta corp  the office of the comptroller of the currency requires that aus and advanta national maintain a risk based capital ratio of at least 
both banks were in excess of the required level and exceeded the minimum capital level of required for designation as a well capitalized depository institution 
at december  and  aus s risk based capital ratio was and  respectively 
advanta national s risk based capital ratio at december  and was and  respectively 
the company intends to take the necessary actions to maintain aus and advanta national  at a minimum  as adequately capitalized banks 
in addition  the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain capital  deposit and dividend rules and regulations as prescribed by state jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate 
at december  and the insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with all requisite rules and regulations 
advanta corp 
and subsidiaries capital expenditures the company spent million for capital expenditures in  primarily for the purchase of land and a building in pennsylvania  leasehold improvements to both the company s new headquarters and a colorado office building  additional space in existing buildings  office and voice communication equipment and furniture and fixtures 
this compared to million for capital expenditures in and million in in  the company anticipates capital expenditures to be comparable to those of to accommodate growth in its operating units 
derivatives activities the company utilizes derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks 
the company has a number of mechanisms in place that enable it to monitor and control both market and credit risk from these derivatives activities 
at the broader level  all derivatives strategies are managed under a hedging policy approved by the board of directors that details the use of such derivatives and the individuals authorized to execute derivatives transactions 
all derivatives strategies must be approved by the company s senior management president  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and treasurer 
as part of this approval process  a market risk analysis is completed to determine the potential impact on the company from severe negative stressed movements in the market 
by policy  derivatives transactions may only be used to manage the company s exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks or for cost reduction and may not be used for speculative purposes 
as such  the impact of any derivatives transaction is calculated using the company s asset liability model to determine its suitability 
the company s investment committee a management committee has a counterparty credit policy 
this policy details the maximum credit exposure  transaction limit and transaction term for counterparties based on an internally assigned investment committee credit rating 
internal counterparty credit ratings reflect the credit ratings from nationally recognized rating agencies  as well as other significant credit factors where appropriate 
each counterparty s credit quality is reviewed as new information becomes available  and  in any case  at least quarterly 
activities with counterparties will be suspended if there is reason to believe that their credit quality is below the company s set standards 
for each counterparty  credit exposure amounts are calculated in a stress environment and represent the maximum aggregate credit exposure from derivatives and other capital market transactions the company is willing to accept from an individually approved counterparty 
to manage counterparty exposure  the company also uses negotiated agreements that establish threshold exposure amounts for each counterparty above which the company has the right to call for and receive collateral for the amount of such excess  thereby limiting its exposure to the threshold amount 
the threshold levels can be fixed or may change as the credit rating of the counterparty changes  and in all cases  the threshold levels are well below the maximum allowable exposure amounts described above 
counterparty master agreements and any collateral agreements  by policy  must be signed prior to the execution of any derivatives transactions with a counterparty 
to date  substantially all master agreements with counterparties have included bilateral collateral agreements 
as such  the potential exposure from a particular counterparty is limited to the maximum threshold level for that counterparty 
the company has a treasury middle office independent of the trading function  which measures  monitors and reports on credit  market and liquidity risk exposures from capital markets  hedging and derivative product activities 
it is the responsibility of this department to ensure compliance with respect to the hedging policy  including the counterparty transaction limits  transaction terms and trader authorizations 
in addition  this department marks each derivatives position to market on a weekly basis using both internal and external models 
these models have been benchmarked against a sample of advanta corp 
and subsidiaries derivatives dealers valuation models for accuracy 
position and counterparty exposure reports are generated and used to manage collateral requirements of the counterparty and the company 
all of these procedures and processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance that prior to and after the execution of any derivatives strategy  market  credit and liquidity risks are fully analyzed and incorporated into the company s asset liability and risk measurement models and the proper accounting treatment for the transaction is identified and executed 
during  the fasb issued its exposure draft for accounting for hedging and derivatives 
this draft  an attempt to standardize accounting treatment for derivatives and hedging  would materially alter the accounting treatment for the use of such instruments in the reduction of interest rate risk 
the fasb is currently reviewing comments received on the exposure draft 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of these deliberations at this time 
credit risk management management regularly reviews the loan portfolio in order to evaluate the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses 
the evaluation includes such factors as the inherent credit quality of the loan portfolio  past experience  current economic conditions  projected credit losses and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
the reserve for credit losses is maintained for on balance sheet receivables 
the on balance sheet reserve is intended to cover all credit losses inherent in the owned loan portfolio 
with regard to securitized assets  anticipated losses and related recourse reserves are reflected in the calculations of securitization income  amounts due from credit card securitizations and other assets 
recourse reserves are intended to cover all probable credit losses over the life of the securitized receivables 
management evaluates both its on balance sheet and recourse reserve requirements and  as appropriate  effects additions to and or transfers between these accounts 
the reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was million  or of owned receivables  at december   compared to million  or of owned receivables  at december  the reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was million  or of owned receivables  in asset quality impaired assets include both nonperforming assets personal finance loans and business loans and leases past due days or more  real estate owned  bankrupt  decedent and fraudulent credit card accounts  and off lease equipment and accruing loans past due days or more on credit cards 
the carrying value for real estate owned is based on net realizable value after taking into account holding costs and costs of disposition and is reflected in other assets 
gross interest income that would have been recorded in and for owned nonperforming assets  had interest been accrued throughout the year in accordance with the assets original terms  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the amount of interest on nonperforming assets included in income for and was 
million and million  respectively 
in the third quarter of  the company adopted a new charge off methodology related to bankrupt credit card accounts  providing for up to a day rather than up to a day investigative period following notification of the bankruptcy petition  prior to charge off 
this new methodology is consistent with others in the credit card industry 
the credit statistics set forth in the following table reflect this change in methodology
