item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company is a holding company that  through its subsidiaries  underwrites specialty property and casualty insurance in sectors of the insurance industry that are generally considered difficult to insure 
many of the coverages written by the company can be categorized as excess and surplus lines  which generally means that the risks are nonstandard  or that the policies in respect of the risks are written with unusual limits or at deviated rates 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical 
the excess and surplus lines sectors of the property and casualty insurance industry are often subject to greater cyclicality and volatility than the industry in general 
during soft markets  large standard lines insurers often utilize excess capacity to assume risks in excess and surplus and specialty lines 
during hard markets  such insurers tend to abandon the excess and surplus and specialty lines to the carriers that concentrate in these sectors 
thus  capacity in these lines will fluctuate substantially  often with fluctuations in revenues or profits  or both
