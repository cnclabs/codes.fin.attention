results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  marketing and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the company s operating results have historically been  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  anticipated and unanticipated decreases in unit average selling prices of the company s products  availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold and in the mix of sales by distribution channels  the gain or loss of significant customers  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  seasonal customer demand  and the timing of significant orders 
the company s operating results may fluctuate from those in prior periods or may be adversely affected in periods in which it is undergoing a product line transition in which production and sales of new products are ramping up and in which existing products are under extreme price pressures due to competitive factors 
if new products are not brought to market in a timely manner or do not address market needs or performance requirements  then the company s operating results will be adversely affected 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating results and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in net sales or net income from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
net sales the company s net sales to date have been generated from the sale of its graphics and multimedia accelerators 
the company s products are used in  and its business is dependent on  the personal computer industry with sales primarily in the us  asia  and europe 
net sales were million in  a increase above the million in net sales increased in primarily as a result of the addition of the virge product line and strong demand for the company s bit trio products that resulted in increased unit shipments 
the increased sales of the virge and trio family of accelerators was partially offset by a decrease in the bit vision family of accelerators  which has decreased significantly as the company transitioned to sales of its virge family of d d accelerators 
the company expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period as new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 
the increase in unit shipments was partially offset by lower overall average selling prices for all the product families 
due to competitive price pressures  the company s products experience declining unit average selling prices over time  which at times can be substantial 
net sales were million in  a increase above the million in net sales increased in primarily due to market demand for the company s bit products  increased product availability from the company s qualified independent foundries and the addition of several new products to the company s product line 
the increase in unit shipments was partially offset by lower overall average selling prices 
the pricing environment for d graphics accelerators  which accounted for a majority of the company s net sales in  has recently experienced and is expected to continue to experience increasing pricing pressures due in part to the alleviation of supply constraints that contributed to more stable pricing in and to aggressive pricing from certain of the company s competitors 
in particular  the company s trio family of integrated d accelerators experienced significant decreases in average selling prices in the company expects that the graphics accelerator market will transition from d acceleration to d acceleration  and the company has introduced its virge family of d d accelerators in response to this expected transition 
as a result of the entry of competitors into the d acceleration market  the company anticipates that it may experience increased pricing pressures on average selling prices for the virge family of d d accelerators 
if the transition occurs slower than expected  if the company s graphic products do not achieve market acceptance  or if the pricing pressures increase  then the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
export sales accounted for   and of net sales in   and respectively 
approximately and of export sales were shipped to hong kong and taiwan  respectively and of export sales in were to affiliates of united states customers 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurance that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels 
all sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
one customer accounted for of net sales in  two customers accounted for and of net sales in and two customers accounted for and of net sales in the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its strategic customers or that such customers will not otherwise cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  that such orders will be replaced by other sales 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the occurrence of any such events or the loss of a strategic customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the occurrence of any supply problems for the company s products may adversely affect the rate of growth in net sales 
net sales may also be adversely affected by delays in the production ramp of customers new programs and systems which incorporate the company s products 
in addition  the company generally ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with shipments in the third month higher at the end of the month 
this pattern  which is common in the semiconductor industry  is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  a disruption in the company s production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce the company s net sales for that quarter 
the company s reliance on outside foundries and independent assembly and testing houses reduces the company s ability to control  among other things  delivery schedules 
gross margin gross margin percentage was in and the gross margin in was impacted by decreases in overall average selling prices of the bit trio family and virge family of accelerators  offset by the decrease in the unit average costs resulting from the company s foundries conversion to inch wafers and micron technology and changes in the pricing strategies from independent foundries for finished goods inventory due to the alleviation of supply constraints in and shift in product mix from the vision products to the virge products 
in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in the unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold  the profitability of the usc joint venture the company recognizes its proportionate share of usc profits and losses  the extent to which the company forfeits or utilizes it production capacity rights with tsmc  the extent to which the company will incur additional licensing fees and shifts in sales mix between add in card and motherboard manufacturers and systems oems 
gross margin percentage increased to in from in the gross margin percentage increase in was primarily due to the gross margin in being adversely impacted by a pre tax million charge for adjusting the valuation of the company s non integrated bit inventory to reflect a decline in its value and to a lesser extent to increase the reserve for excess inventory for those products 
the market value of the company s non integrated bit products declined primarily because competitors integrated bit accelerator products offered a more competitive solution 
additionally  the gross margin increased as the company achieved proportionately greater decreases in unit average costs compared to decreases in overall average selling prices 
the unit average cost decreases were principally the result of changes in the company s design method and manufacturing strategy and shifts to lower cost foundries 
the company must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments and  because the markets for the company s products are volatile and its products are subject to rapid technological and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
the company s customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect the company s operating results  as the company may be unable to adjust its purchases from its independent foundries to match such customers changes and cancellations 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
research and development expenses the company has made and intends to continue to make significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in research and development spending increases reflect additions to the company s engineering staff and initial product verification and nonrecurring engineering expenses related to the introduction of new products 
research and development spending is expected to increase in absolute dollars in as a result of product development activities currently underway for the desktop  mobile and home pc markets with a focus on video  d  audio and communications 
products in the company s market typically have a life cycle of to months 
the successful development and commercialization of new products required to replace or supplement existing products involve many risks  including the identification of new product opportunities  the successful and timely completion of the development process  and the selection of the company s products by leading systems suppliers and motherboard and add in card manufacturers for design into their products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring to the market in a timely manner successful new products  that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products noncompetitive  or that the company s products will be selected for design into its customers products 
in addition  it is possible that the company s products may be found defective after the company has already shipped significant volume production 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully correct such problems or that such corrections would be acceptable to customers 
the occurrence of any such events would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in selling and marketing costs have increased from year to year as a result of additional personnel  increased commissions associated with higher sales levels and increased marketing costs associated with the introduction of new products 
administrative costs have increased due to the hiring of additional personnel necessary to support the increased level of operations and the litigation costs in defending the brooktree lawsuit  which was settled in august the company anticipates that selling  marketing and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in other income  net other income  net  decreased in to million from million in the decrease is attributable to the interest expense incurred on million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which were issued by the company in september other income  net  increased in to million from million in other income  net  increased in due to the higher average amounts of cash and short term investments as a result of the net proceeds of million from a follow on common stock offering completed in may income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was in  in and in the tax rate was lower due to an increase in tax credits as a result of the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars 
in  the effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes partially offset by research and development credits 
the tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate in as research and development tax credits had a greater impact in due to the lower pre tax income as a result of the pre tax charge of million discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million in to million from million at the end of the company generated million from operating activities in  offset by million of cash used for investing activities  including the usc joint venture  net purchases of investments and investments in property  plant and equipment 
in addition  the company generated million of cash from financing activities  primarily due to the net proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in the third quarter of  net borrowings on the equipment financing and line of credit  and million of proceeds from the sale of common stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  an increase of million from million in the increase was due to net income  lower accounts receivable  and higher accrued liabilities and income taxes payable  partially offset by an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses and other and a decrease in accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts receivable is a result of greater linearity in sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  in which a substantial proportion of shipments occurred in the third month of that quarter as compared to the first two months of that quarter 
the increase in inventory is primarily due to higher levels of finished goods to support increased levels of business 
cash provided by operating activities for was million primarily due to an increase in net income and to working capital management in as compared to the company experienced an increase in inventory and accounts receivable due to a substantial increase in net sales 
these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash used for operating activities in was million  reflecting increases in inventories and accounts receivable which more than offset other sources of cash provided by operating activities 
accounts receivable increased primarily as a result of the substantial increase in net sales in as compared to and to the concentration of sales in december continued expansion of the company s business is likely to require higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
investing activities for the years ended december    and reflected property and equipment purchases of million  million  and million  respectively  sales and maturities of short term investments  the investment in a real estate partnership for the company s new headquarters facility of million and the investment in joint venture of million  as discussed below 
continued expansion of the company s business may require higher levels of capital equipment purchases  foundry investments and other payments to secure manufacturing capacity 
financing activities provided cash of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in primarily reflects the offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes completed in september net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately million 
the notes mature in interest is payable semi annually at per annum 
the notes are convertible at the option of the note holders into the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
beginning in october  the notes are redeemable at the option of the company at an initial redemption price of of the principal amount 
the company has reserved  shares of common stock plus such additional number of shares that may be required pursuant to the operation of anti dilution provisions for the conversion of these notes 
the amount primarily reflects the net proceeds of the follow on common stock offering completed in may in  the company entered into two long term manufacturing capacity arrangements 
the company entered into an agreement with umc and alliance semiconductor corporation to form usc  a separate taiwanese company  for the purpose of building and managing a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the science based industrial park in hsin chu city  taiwan  republic of china 
the company invested million in and million in for its equity interest 
the facility commenced production utilizing advanced submicron semiconductor manufacturing processes in late the company has the right to purchase up to of the output from the foundry 
in addition  the company expanded and formalized its relationship with tsmc to provide additional capacity over the to timeframe 
the agreement with tsmc requires the company to make certain annual advance payments to be applied against the following year s capacity 
the company has signed promissory notes to secure these payments  which total million as of december   over the term of the agreement 
the company paid million in see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
working capital at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
at december  the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
in addition  the company has a million unsecured revolving line of credit that expires june  the company had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit as of december  in addition  the company has available two separate secured equipment lines of credit totaling million 
the company had million outstanding under these secured equipment lines of credit at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its available funds and its anticipated funds from operations will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months  other than expenditures for future potential manufacturing agreements 
in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods  equity investments in  advances or issuances of equity securities to wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct wafer fabrication facilities 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire businesses  technology or products that complement the business of the company 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry periodically results in shortages of advanced process wafer fabrication capacity such as the company experiences from time to time 
the company s ability to maintain adequate levels of inventory is primarily dependent upon the company obtaining sufficient supply of products to meet future demand  and any inability of the company to maintain adequate inventory levels may adversely affect its relations with its customers 
in addition  because the company must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products because the company s products are volatile and subject to rapid technological and price changes 
this inventory risk is heightened because certain of the company s key customers place orders with short lead times 
the company s customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect the company s liquidity  as the company may be unable to adjust its purchases from its independent foundries to match such customer changes and cancellations 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
in october  brooktree filed a complaint against the company in the united states district court for the southern district of california  alleging that the company s current products infringe a brooktree patent 
such lawsuit resulted in substantial expense to the company to defend the action and diverted the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel 
in august  the company and brooktree entered into a settlement and license agreement pursuant to which all claims and counterclaims between the parties were dismissed and the company agreed to pay to brooktree a license fee and royalties related to certain product revenues over a five year period 
such amount are not expected to significantly impact future results of operations
