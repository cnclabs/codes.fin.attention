item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues the company s revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were million  a decrease of from revenues of million for the fiscal year ended march  
the company believes that cutbacks in its sales and marketing efforts during fiscal impacted its ability to book new orders and resulted in lower sales during these cutbacks were a result of cash conservation measures put in place prior to the company completing a private placement in august after receiving the additional equity financing  the company hired and replaced employees in the sales department and otherwise increased marketing efforts including additional trade show attendance and advertising 
as a result of this refocus  bookings for the fourth quarter of were the highest in company history million 
net product sales of million decreased million in primarily due to a lower level of shipments of military aerospace products 
military shipments were impacted by the winding down of a missile guidance system program which is approaching the end of its life cycle 
volume in military aerospace products should increase in fiscal as the company begins deliveries under a new  longer term military program 
the company was awarded a contract for million under this program which  along with follow on orders  should provide a solid base to grow revenues over the next few years 
during  net product sales of large area avalanche photodiode laapd products increased by  to  during  the company curtailed laapd production because of low reliability and yields it was obtaining in the manufacturing process 
after considerable research efforts  the company developed a new manufacturing process which it anticipates will significantly improve both reliability and process yields 
in july  the company filed for a patent seeking protection of the new manufacturing process  and has begun to aggressively market laapd products to original equipment manufacturers 
while the company anticipates increasing volume from sales of laapd products made with its newly developed manufacturing process  further refinements in the manufacturing process will be required before full production can be achieved 
while current demand exceeds the company s ability to deliver  the company expects but cannot insure that the remaining manufacturing issues can be corrected in the near term 
the company has a number of customers who are early adopters and evaluators of the technology and believes that demonstration of these applications and evaluations will help to develop the marketplace 
development contract revenues decreased by  
the company was awarded a phase ii department of energy doe grant of approximately  in june based upon the success of a phase i effort  and in december  was awarded a million contract from the advanced research projects agency of the pentagon and the aircraft division of the naval air warfare center arpa nawc 
these types of government development contracts are typically multi year awards and are subject to periodic review and cancellation by the government due to a variety of reasons including a lack of funding 
during the third quarter of  revenues from the doe contract began to wind down and the contract was completed 
during the second half of  revenues from the arpa nawc contract were impacted by a delay in funding from the customer 
funding was awarded in january to complete option one of the contract and work should resume in q costs and expenses cost of product sales decreased by  in and gross profit margin on net product sales decreased by percentage points compared to to 
the decreases are attributable to lower product shipments and a related decrease in manufacturing volume efficiencies 
in line with the reduction in product shipments  the company has reduced its workforce permanent and temporary employees from to during through attrition and a reduction in force in february research and development costs decreased by  to million in the decrease in r d costs is primarily due to the lower level of r d effort on government contracts see revenues above as well as a general reduction in internal r d efforts as the company focuses more on the production of the laapd 
in addition  the company has better controlled internal r d activities 
r d costs have varied significantly in the past  and may continue to do so  due to the level of activity associated with development contracts as well as the number and complexity of new process and product development projects  the qualification of new process developments and customer evaluation and acceptance of new products 
the company is currently developing laapd imaging arrays which the company believes will have the greatest future market potential within the line of laapd products 
an acceleration in development and or efforts to bring this technology into production could substantially impact r d costs 
marketing and sales expenses increased by  to  in the increases were primarily due to increased manpower and higher marketing costs 
this increase was expected  as the company pursues its plan for growth 
in addition  sales and marketing expenditures had been deferred during awaiting the successful completion of a private placement offering see liquidity and capital resources

net product sales increased by principally from increased volume in military and commercial aerospace products 
included in these products are shipments to the company s largest customer where the company has been able to expand it s product offering and provide additional value added to it s product line 
higher volume in military and commercial aerospace products was partially offset by lower volume in industrial and medical products 
shipments of laapd products were nominal and slightly lower than for during  the company suspended most shipments of its proprietary laapd products and curtailed laapd production because of a high rate of field failures and low manufacturing yields 
during  the company focused essentially all research and development resources on the baseline laapd manufacturing process to produce devices with both good performance and improved reliability as well as with improved process yields 
the company believed these efforts were successful and resumed shipment of evaluation products during the third quarter of fiscal year costs and expenses cost of product sales decreased by  in despite the increase in net product sales 
the gross profit margin on net product sales strengthened to  an increase of percentage points compared to this increase in gross margin on net product sales was attributable to a number of factors including improved pricing  cost containment programs  productivity improvements and product mix improvements

the company s laapd technology is still considered to be in the development stage and subject to risks inherent in the development of products based on new technologies 
these risks include getting the invention out of the laboratory and into actual use in the field and stepping up production from the prototype early stages of manufacturing 
to enable the company to meet its capital commitment needs  the company historically has supplemented cash operating needs with proceeds from private placement equity financing  bank lines of credit and loans from stockholders 
at march   no amounts were outstanding under any bank line of credit and there were no stockholder loans to the company

the company has used the proceeds of its private placement offering to implement its strategic business plan  which focuses on growing the core business  bringing initial laapd products to market and developing proof of concept demonstration laapd arrays which are expected to prove helpful in securing future financing and strategic partners 
the continued development of laapd arrays beyond the proof of concept phase may require additional funds 
the company believes that the moderate rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant impact on the company s sales or operating results 
forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements that are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks including  but not limited to  unforseen technological obstacles which may prevent or slow the development and or manufacture of new products  limited or slower than anticipated customer acceptance of new products which have been and are being developed by the company particularly its laapd product line  and a decline in the general demand for optoelectronic products
