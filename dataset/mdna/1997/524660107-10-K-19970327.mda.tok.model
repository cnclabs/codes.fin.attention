item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity the company s financial position reflects several important principles and guidelines of management s capital policy 
these include management s belief that corporate liquidity must always be adequate to support the company s projected growth rate 
at the same time  liquidity must assure management that the company will be able to withstand any amount of financial adversity that can reasonably be anticipated 
management also intends to direct capital to strategic acquisitions and other investments that provide additional opportunities for expansion and enhanced profitability 
financial planning to meet these needs reflects management s belief that the company should never be forced to expand its capital resources  whether debt or equity  at a time not of its choosing 
management also believes that financial flexibility is more important than maximization of earnings per share through excessive leverage 
therefore  management continuously provides for available credit in excess of projected cash needs and has maintained a guideline for long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization in a range of to

the second layer of the company s debt capital consists of revolving bank credit agreements 
over the years  management has renegotiated these bank credit agreements and established a commercial paper program to continuously support the company s projected growth and to maintain highly flexible sources of debt capital 
the credit under these arrangements has been a long term obligation 
if needed  however  the credit is available for short term borrowings and repayments

results of operations the results of operations during the last three years reflect various elements of the company s long term growth strategy  along with general trends in the economy and the markets the company serves 
the company s growth strategy continues to include internal programs and acquisitions which broaden product lines and provide for increased market penetration and operating efficiencies 
with a continuing emphasis on the development of new and improved products and advancements in production technologies  the company is able to consistently offer high quality products  competitively priced 
trends in the general economy were favorable during the last three years 
in  economic growth increased  particularly near the end of the year 
economic growth moderated during in  growth increased during the year 
in each of the last three years  acquisitions accounted for more of the company s sales growth than other factors 
the balance of the sales growth during this period primarily reflected increases in unit volumes  as selling price increases were only a minor factor 
inflation in prices for raw materials generally decreased in  except in foam scrap 
therefore  the company was generally able to refrain from raising selling prices during most of the last two years 
in  due to increasing prices for raw materials  the company increased selling prices with the largest increases concentrated in aluminum products 
some earlier cost increases for steel and wire products were not passed along in the company s selling prices until the end of  or the first half of the following table shows various measures of earnings as a percentage of sales for the last three years 
it also shows the effective income tax rate and the coverage of interest expense by pre tax earnings plus interest 
gross profit margin pre tax profit margin reported impact of non recurring costs excluding non recurring costs net profit margin reported impact of non recurring costs excluding non recurring costs effective income tax rate interest coverage ratio x x x the company s gross profit margins improved in the last two years 
the increase in reflected several favorable factors 
these included continued increases in production efficiencies  increased sales in niche markets of products with above average margins  better manufacturing overhead absorption  and reduced costs 
the pre tax profit margin  before non recurring costs  increased due to the factors noted  but reflected a slight increase in total selling  distribution and administrative expenses 
the non recurring costs in were associated with the pace acquisition and are discussed in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the slight increase in the gross profit margin primarily reflected the company s continuing growth in niche markets with above average margins  increased production efficiencies and cost containment 
the increase in the gross profit margin was offset by slight increases in total selling  distribution and administrative expenses and interest expense  as a percentage of sales 
therefore  the pre tax profit margin was unchanged from the previous year 
in  the gross profit margin increased from in  primarily reflecting improved market conditions in the aluminum and foam industries and gains in overall manufacturing efficiencies on higher volume 
these favorable factors more than offset cost price pressures the company continued to experience in operations producing steel products 
a reduction in total selling  distribution and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  was slightly more than offset by higher interest expense and other deductions  net of other income
