item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook cell genesys the company is focused on the development and commercialization of gene therapies to treat major  life threatening diseases  including aids and cancer 
the company s objective is to commercialize both ex vivo gene therapy with genetically engineered human immune cells and in vivo gene therapies 
in january  the company signed a merger agreement with somatix therapy corporation somatix 
pending approval by stockholders of both companies  the merger is expected to strengthen the company s position in the field of gene therapy 
since its inception in  the company has funded its research and development activities primarily through the sale of equity  corporate partnerships and leaseline financings 
the company has been unprofitable since its inception and has incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
in june  cell genesys announced the establishment of abgenix  inc abgenix  a subsidiary which will focus exclusively on the development and commercialization of the company s human monoclonal antibodies for pharmaceutical applications  including inflammation  autoimmune disorders  and cancer 
all partnership interests and intellectual property relating to the company s antibody business have been transferred to abgenix as part of its initial formation 
the following discussion constitutes forward looking statements insofar as it relates to progress in the company s research and development programs and clinical trials  product expectations  in licensing plans  expected cash expenditures and expense levels  and the adequacy of the company s available resources 
actual results could differ materially from statements made due to a number of factors  including those set forth in risk factors below 
in the company s lead gene therapy program  safety results for the company s phase i clinical trial testing aids gene therapy indicated no significant treatment related safety problems 
the company is currently in phase ii clinical testing of this therapy in an initial proof of principle trial in twins  in which t cells from the healthy twin are modified and infused as therapy for the hiv positive twin and in a second phase ii trial of a patient specific approach in individuals with hiv infection 
additional clinical trials of cell genesys aids gene therapy will be conducted during these include an evaluation of an improved manufacturing process involving the genetic modification of both killer t cells and helper t cells as well as a reduction in cell processing time to less than three weeks 
in addition  a new pilot study is planned by cell genesys to evaluate whether the combination of aids gene therapy and antiviral drugs can delay the recurrence of hiv infection  which has been generally observed in patients who stop their antiviral drug therapy 
this pilot study will help determine whether the gene therapy can reduce the requirement for long term treatment with combinations of three or more antiviral drugs 
the company anticipates efficacy data from certain of these trials at the end of during june  in connection with the initiation of patient enrollment in the second phase ii clinical trial to evaluate patient specific aids gene therapy  the company received a million milestone payment under its collaboration with hoechst marion roussel  inc hmr 
also in june  the company initiated product development of its lead cancer gene therapy product candidate for colon and other specific cancers 
based on successful preclinical studies  the company plans to initiate human clinical testing for its initial cancer gene therapy product candidate by mid the company also has ongoing research programs in stem cell gene therapy  universal donor cells and other gene delivery technologies 
the company believes that such programs may provide opportunities for collaborative arrangements with third parties that could also provide additional funding to the company 
in the company s human monoclonal antibody program now being pursued through abgenix  the company has developed transgenic technology to create strains of mice capable of producing fully human monoclonal antibodies 
the company has created strains of mice which now contain the majority of human antibody genes and could produce multiple product candidates 
the company believes that fully human antibodies should avoid the allergic reactions seen with antibodies containing mouse proteins  which should make them better suited to long term therapy and could provide a marketing advantage 
in  the company initiated preclinical studies of a human antibody to interleukin il  which potentially could be used as a treatment to inhibit excess inflammation in certain diseases such as psoriasis  adult respiratory disease syndrome ards  rheumatoid arthritis and reperfusion injury associated with heart attack or stroke 
based on progress of preclinical studies  abgenix plans to initiate human clinical trials for this antibody product candidate during the second half of the company s net cash expenditures for in its current operations are not expected to exceed approximately million  excluding one time merger related expenditures  and the company intends to manage toward this net cash expenditure target 
pending stockholder approval  significant merger related costs will be incurred  including cash payments currently estimated at approximately million 
the company may from time to time evaluate opportunities to acquire or in license other potential products and technologies 
expenses associated with in licensing such products may constitute unbudgeted expenses 
results of operations revenue increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increases in and reflect revenues from the collaboration with hmr which was entered into in october for the company s aids gene therapy program  including a million milestone payment earned during other revenues resulted from the company s joint venture xenotech with jt immunotech usa inc jt immunotech in its human monoclonal antibody program see note to financial statements 
also  in and the company received million and million  respectively  through its agreements with akzo nobel nv for the license of a therapeutic protein product 
during  funding of research by xenotech is expected to terminate  the company will receive a final million payment from akzo nobel nv  and the initial research and development funding committed by hmr will be completed 
there can be no assurance that hmr will continue progress dependent research and development funding or that the company will be successful in attracting new collaborative partners or in generating revenues from collaboration agreements 
research and development expenses have increased to million during from million and million in and  respectively 
these increases were due to additional research and development staff  facilities  and contract services related to the company s human clinical trials for aids and the preclinical studies of human monoclonal antibodies 
also contributing to the growth were legal fees incurred in defending and maintaining the company s intellectual property positions 
as a result of the settlement of litigation with genpharm international  inc in march see item legal procedings certain of these legal expenses can be expected to decrease in research and development expenses in each of these three years represented approximately of total expenses 
the company expects that its research and development expenditures  including expansion of facilities  will continue to increase to support additional product development activities 
the rate of increase depends on a number of factors including stockholder approval of the merger agreement with somatix and progress in research and development  especially clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during from million and million in and  respectively 
the increases also reflect growth in administrative staff and outside services required to support expanded research and development programs 
the company expects these expenses to increase as these programs expand 
interest income increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was due to higher average cash balances available for investment 
interest expense increased to million in from million and  in and  respectively  due to higher levels of property and equipment financing 
the company s net loss was million in  million in  and million in during and  higher revenues as a result of the company s collaboration for aids gene therapy offset higher operating expenses resulting in net losses during each of those years approximately level with or less than losses are expected to continue and are likely to increase in future years as operating expenses rise  particularly as the company incurs expenses related to expanded manufacturing and human testing of its potential products 
in addition  pending stockholder approval of the merger with somatix  the company expects to record non recurring charges to operations consisting of i a non cash charge for acquired in process technology estimated at million and ii a restructuring charge estimated in the range of to million  including severance costs and costs associated with elimination of redundant facilities and assets 
at december   the company had available net operating loss and research credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  funding under collaborative arrangements and equipment financing 
from inception through december   the company received million in net proceeds from equity financing  million under collaborative agreements and utilized million of property and equipment financing 
at december   the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  this increase of million was primarily due to million provided by operating activities offset by million contributions to xenotech joint venture  million capital expenditures and million net cash used in financing activities 
the company expects its cash requirements to increase significantly in the future 
the company s capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including stockholder approval of the merger agreement with somatix  the progress of the company s research and development programs  preclinical and clinical trials  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing requirements  the attraction and maintenance of collaborative partners  the acquisition of new products or technologies  and the cost of litigation  patent interference proceedings or other legal proceedings or their resolution 
in march  cell genesys announced that  together with abgenix  xenotech and japan tobacco  it had signed a comprehensive patent cross license and settlement agreement with genpharm that resolved all related litigation and claims between the parties 
the cross license agreement includes a worldwide royalty free cross license to all issued and related patent applications pertaining to the generation of fully human monoclonal antibody technologies in genetically modified strains of mice 
cell genesys also obtained a license to certain technology in the field of gene therapy held by genpharm 
as consideration for the settlement and cross license agreement  cell genesys agreed to issue a note due september  for million  convertible into shares of cell genesys common stock at per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment in twelve months 
the agreement also calls for two milestone payments of million each based on the issuance certain patents in the future 
these payments would be made by xenotech  which is an equal joint venture of abgenix and japan tobacco 
under its current collaborations  the company is responsible for funding a portion of its research and development efforts 
substantial capital may be required to carry out additional product development and to commercialize both products under the current collaborations and the company s self funded efforts 
the company believes that its available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   together with payments to be received under the company s collaborative arrangement with hmr  and million in equipment financing available for capital equipment purchases will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements at least through thereafter  the company will require substantial additional funds 
because of the company s significant long term cash requirements  it will seek to raise additional capital if conditions in the public equity markets are favorable  even if the company does not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
risk factors there are significant risks associated with the company s plans and goals  including but not limited to the success of the company s research and development programs  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain regulatory approval process  uncertainties and costs associated with obtaining third party licenses  obtaining patent protection  protecting trade secrets  enforcing intellectual property rights important to the company s business and avoiding infringement of others intellectual property  competitive products  and the availability of capital to fund the company s operations and capital requirements 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to the company  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to the company or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
see item legal proceedings 
some or all of these factors may affect the company s goals to file inds  advance product candidates through the clinical trial process  to commercialize products and secure financing either through corporate partnerships or additional equity offerings 
even if the company s goals are fully achieved  the company does not anticipate commercialization of any product for several years 
because of the novelty of the company s gene therapy technology  clinical trials are more difficult than for products based on more traditional technologies 
in addition  a variety of factors could hinder or delay progress in clinical trials of the company s products or require their discontinuance  including results of ongoing preclinical studies by the company or others  technical or manufacturing difficulties  clinical trial results for the company s or competing products  intellectual property disputes with third parties  and or delays relating to the review process by the fda 
although preliminary results of the company s phase i clinical testing of aids gene therapy reported to date have shown no significant treatment related safety problems  there can be no assurance that this therapy will be tolerated over an extended period of time or that the clinical efficacy of this therapy will be demonstrated 
the company believes that a human antibody product such as that being developed through its subsidiary  abgenix  could be clinically superior to products containing mouse protein  and that it could have marketing advantages over such other products 
however  until human testing has taken place  it is not certain that human antibody products will demonstrate these advantages 
countervailing marketing factors  such as relative price  undesirable side effects  and or relative marketing expertise  may serve to offset or outweigh these advantages 
there is no assurance that opportunities for in licensing products or for third party collaborations will be available to the company on acceptable terms 
finding such opportunities  as well as a variety of other factors  such as progress in the company s research and development programs including clinical trials  receipt of anticipated contract revenues some of which are dependent on milestones  competitive factors  and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending the company s intellectual property rights or their resolution  may affect the company s ability to manage to its targeted net cash expenditures in  and also may affect the adequacy of the company s resources to fund operations and capital requirements at least through failure to achieve the company s goals could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition and its ability to raise additional capital 
stockholders and potential investors should carefully consider the risks associated with the company and should be aware that these risks may negatively impact the company s stock price
