item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the table below reflects the results of operations on both a consolidated and segment basis  excluding divested businesses 
see note the amounts exclude the results of operations of the aerospace segment  divested in march  the electronics printing division of the food functional products segment  divested in december  and the composite products and packaging films divisions of the corporate and other segment  divested in june and april  respectively 
the table should make it easier to compare year over year operating results 
accordingly  the discussion that follows speaks to the comparisons in the table through profit from operations 
dollars in millions unaudited net sales    cost of sales    selling  general  and administrative expenses research and development other operating expenses income  net profit from operations net sales by industry segment chemical specialties    food functional products corporate and other total    profit from operations by industry segment chemical specialties food functional products corporate and other total net sales declined  or million  in lower volume and weaker foreign currencies relative to the dollar account for most of the sales decline 
in  sales increased  or million 
higher selling prices and favorable foreign currencies accounted for much of the improvement 
profit from operations despite lower sales  profit from operations increased  or million  in due to three major reasons 
i revisions to long term incentive compensation plans in  outlined in the following paragraph  reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a in by million 
in addition  sg a charges were abnormally high and included early vesting of the and long term incentive programs and the grant of stock awards to all hercules employees 
see note ii other operating expenses income  net see note  were million lower in environmental remediation costs at the jacksonville  arkansas  site were lower in versus and no additional sites were identified requiring significant environmental expenditures 
additionally  includes million of probable recoveries related to environmental remediation 
iii manufacturing cost improvements increased overall gross margins to from and partially offset the volume driven decline in gross profit dollars 
in  profit from operations increased  or million 
higher selling prices and manufacturing cost improvements led to increased gross profit of million  and gross profit margin increased to from 
sg a expenses increased million  primarily from the early vesting of the and long term incentive compensation programs and the grant of stock awards to all hercules employees 
during  long term incentive compensation programs were revised 
awards of restricted stock and performance shares were replaced by stock options  performance accelerated stock options  and cash value awards payable in shares of hercules stock 
other operating expenses income  net  increased million 
higher environmental costs  particularly those associated with the jacksonville site  accounted for most of the increased expense 
chemical specialties net sales declined  or million  in increased competition from a new competitor and a competitive technology  and negative customer reaction to previous pricing strategies  reduced demand and lowered prices for polypropylene nonwoven fiber 
additionally  lower demand in the construction  adhesives  and tape markets and unfavorable rates of exchange reduced resins revenues 
partially offsetting these reductions were higher revenues in paper technology related to increased volume of wet strength and alkaline size products in europe and new business in asia and south america 
profit from operations declined  or million  in lower revenue and higher raw material costs were partially offset by manufacturing cost improvements and lower costs for employee incentive compensation 
in  net sales increased  or million 
improved pricing  stronger foreign currencies  and increased volume of higher value wet strength products and polypropylene nonwoven fiber more than offset market softness and lower demand for resins and paper technology products 
profit from operations increased  or million  in margins were unchanged as gains from higher revenues and manufacturing cost improvements were offset by higher raw material costs  lower production volume  and increased sg a costs associated with higher incentive compensation 
food functional products net sales declined  or million  in lower overall volume in the construction  oilfield  and food markets  coupled with unfavorable rates of exchange  account for much of the decline 
these declines were softened by improved pricing  particularly in aqualon 
profit from operations increased  or million  in improved pricing  manufacturing cost improvements  and lower employee incentive compensation costs offset the volume decline and increases in raw material costs 
in  net sales increased  or million 
higher selling prices and stronger foreign currencies contributed to growth in both aqualon and food gums 
aqualon volumes were marginally higher  however  lower demand in food markets in the second half of the year reduced overall volume 
profit from operations increased  or million  in higher revenues  coupled with manufacturing cost improvements  were partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower yields  particularly in food gums 
higher sg a costs associated with higher incentive compensation also reduced operating profit 
looking ahead  hercules anticipates the markets it serves to strengthen in this  along with programs to improve its competitive position  should result in volume improvements 
however  because the company supplies relatively mature industries  high growth rates will be difficult to achieve 
the significant strengthening of the dollar against european currencies through and early adds an additional challenge 
also  a fire in the company s pectin production facility in late january will cost it four to six weeks of high value production 
manufacturing cost improvements will continue to be a critical element of success  particularly if raw material costs escalate 
the company anticipates that will be a challenging year  however  overall financial performance is expected to be ahead of corporate and other operating profit increased million in from lower environmental remediation expenses and recognition of probable recoveries for environmental remediation 
in  operating losses increased million from higher environmental costs 
equity in income of affiliated companies increased million 
the improvement reflects a full year of equity earnings from hercules stake in alliant techsystems  acquired in march in conjunction with the sale of the aerospace segment 
improved earnings from tastemaker  a owned flavors joint venture  also added to the improvement 
in  income improved million  reflecting the newly acquired interest in alliant techsystems  along with improved tastemaker earnings 
interest and debt expense increased million from higher average debt over the period 
in  interest and debt expense remained relatively flat as the effect of lower average debt was offset by lower capitalized interest related to reduced capital spending 
other income expense  net see note  decreased million in and increased million in the increase in and subsequent decrease in primarily relates to gains on the sale of the aerospace segment and electronics printing division in the provision for income taxes reflects effective tax rates of in  in  and in the rate was favorably affected by the use of tax loss carryforwards 
the rate was favorably affected by the increased use of foreign tax credits and a state income tax settlement related to a prior year sale of an investment 
the rate was favorably affected by research and experimentation tax credits 
see note financial condition liquidity and financial resources net cash flow from operations was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in primarily relates to higher tax payments and increased working capital requirements 
the higher tax payments in relate to the divestiture of the electronics printing division and settlement of prior years federal income tax audits 
the increase in primarily related to reduced working capital requirements and lower income tax payments 
total cash flow was favorably affected by proceeds from asset disposals of million in  million in  and million in in the three year period ended december   the company satisfied its cash requirements for capital expenditures  other investing activities  and dividends entirely from operating cash flows

capital expenditures remained relatively flat at million in  while declining from million in this decrease relates primarily to the completion in of the methylcellulose facility in doel  belgium 
during  the company increased the deductible for property and business interruption insurance to million

commitments and capital structure total capitalization stockholders equity plus debt remained relatively flat at billion at december  stockholders equity declined million as share repurchases continued  while total debt increased million 
as a result  total debt as a percentage of capitalization increased to from

hercules has been identified by us federal and state authorities as a potentially responsible party for environmental cleanup at numerous sites 
the estimated range of reasonably possible costs for remediation is between million and million 
the company does not anticipate that its financial condition will be materially affected by environmental remediation costs in excess of amounts accrued  although quarterly or annual operating results could be materially affected 
see note environmental remediation expenses are funded from internal sources of cash 
such expenses are not expected to have a significant effect on the company s ongoing liquidity 
environmental cleanup costs  including capital expenditures for ongoing operations  are a normal  recurring part of operations and are not significant in relation to total operating costs or cash flows
