the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in the form k 
overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a number of forward looking statements which reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  that cause results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
in this report the words expects  anticipates  believes  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which speak only as to the date hereof 
the company s sales were million and net income was  six cents per share  compared to sales of million and net income of  one cent per share 
the increase in sales and net income was due to results from milford manufacturing corporation milford  which was acquired effective november  the tooling segment posted another solid year of profitability  while the metal forming segment struggled with another year of operating losses see segment review below 
during the company began shipments of parts for two major programs starter motor shafts for an automotive supplier and transmission shafts for an automotive company 
these two programs required the acquisition of substantial new equipment  which was primarily financed by million in industrial development revenue bonds sold in the transmission shaft program involves part forging and machining by uniflow 
the starter motor shaft program involves value added manufacturing from uniflow  for its parts forming capability  and milford  which completes extensive machining of the part 
the company did not realize any significant contribution to sales and profitability from these programs in  because production did not commence until the fourth quarter 
subsequent to year end  the company has experienced problems in achieving cycle times anticipated within its machining production line for the manufacture of starter motor shafts 
although efficiency improvements continue to be made  it is unclear how long it will take to bring this product to profitability 
the company s cash flow from operations and availability from lines of credit was adequate to fund operations as well as various new programs and initiatives 
the company s ability to meet ongoing debt obligations in the next year will be dependent  in part  on improvements in cash from operations  as availability on the lines of credit are significantly less 
making this matter more critical  subsequent to the year ended september   milford s monthly operating results have significantly declined 
management is currently in discussions with milford s primary customer to explore alternatives to turnaround this situation 
management is also evaluating the prospects of disposing underperforming assets  within its three business segments  to generate cash and reduce debt 
results of operations metal parts forming segment chart of three year comparative operating results in thousands amount amount amount net sales    gross profit   operating expense    operating profit loss  before interest  bad debt and corporate overhead expense 
the metal parts forming segment is comprised of the company s uniflow unit 
uniflow currently manufactures suspension ball joint housings  truck wheel fasteners  transmission shaft parts and a variety of oem cold formed and forged parts 
customers are primarily automotive and trucking related original equipment manufacturers oem and service part manufacturers after market 
net sales increased in from and decreased in from the sales increase in from primarily reflects higher sales of airbag housings  starter motor shafts and transmission shafts 
uniflow s existing business of suspension housings  transmission shafts and wheel studs also increased in over the company has decided to discontinue the manufacture of airbag housings due  in part  to the continuing investment required to achieve additional sales in relation to potential profit margins from those sales 
management is reviewing all of its sales with the objective of retaining only profitable product lines that will also allow for more efficient production through improved utilization of direct and indirect labor 
gross profit on sales was in  in and in the decline in gross profit reflects costs associated with the start up of two new programs transmission parts and starter motor shafts  lower production efficiency and higher indirect labor expense 
efforts for the prior three years  aimed at improving uniflow s gross profit  have been disappointing 
management is currently evaluating the merits of streamlining uniflow s operations in order to reduce its cost of manufacturing 
management remains committed to achieving compliance with the quality standard qs  as well as the implementation of a computerized information system that will provide on line shop floor production and financial data 
operating expense as a percentage of sales was in  in and in the percentage fluctuation was largely due to the varying sales level 
actual operating overhead expense in was million  down from million in and million in the decrease in from primarily reflects lower personnel expense 
uniflow s profit loss from operations was million of sales   of sales in   of sales in the increase in loss in from is the result of increased factory costs associated with developing new jobs for production as well as reduced production efficiency on uniflow s traditional business 
the profit decrease in from reflects the lower sales volume and higher costs of production 
tooling segment chart of three year comparable operating results in thousands amount amount amount net sales    gross profit    operating expense    operating profit    before elimination of intercompany sales 
the tooling segment is comprised of the form flow  l h and micanol units 
the triple unit was downsized and absorbed into form flow s operation in june the tooling units sell tools and dies for use in the production of hot and cold formed metal parts 
net sales were flat in  increasing by over  while in sales decreased compared to  primarily due to the downsizing of triple tool in late fiscal although sales grew only  gross profit on sales improved to in  compared to in and in the gross profit percentage increased as management was able to control shop floor labor and related support expense as well as concentrate on tooling sales orders that complement its particular skilled labor and machining capabilities 
operating expense as a percentage of sales has remained steady for the periods shown  and was in  in  and in the tooling segment s operating profit was million of sales in million of sales in  and million of sales in the increase in operating profit in over primarily reflects the improved gross profit on sales 
the decline in gross profit in compared to reflected lower profitability at form flow  l h and micanol 
production machining segment chart of operating results in thousands amount net sales  gross profit  operating expense  operating profit for the eleven months ended september   as the production machining segment is comprised of milford  acquired november  sales in were strong among all three major variations of brake valve parts supplied to the unit s primary customer  vkh 
the sales strength was largely related to the recent market popularity of two wheel anti lock braking systems in automobile sales 
two of the three existing brake valve parts are assembled in two wheel anti lock assemblies 
for the period beginning november  through october  the unit received product pricing above the agreed upon product pricing schedule 
beginning november   pricing reverted to the original pricing schedule 
the unit s gross profit was for the entire year  however that margin declined markedly in the fourth fiscal quarter 
this decline continued into the first quarter of fiscal and is due largely to higher release schedules from its principal customer  causing additional overtime and outside processing costs  inadequate machinery repair and maintenance  insufficient tool engineering support management  and resources diverted to the start up of two major lines of parts manufacturing 
remedial programs are currently in progress to fix the machinery and tooling that is in disrepair or not fully functional 
management believes that it could take up to six months to complete the necessary repairs and related remedial actions 
in addition  management may request a product pricing adjustment from its primary customer although there are no assurances that one would be given 
operating expense  of sales  increased during the year  as management filled quality assurance and engineering positions it believes are necessary to run a successful operation 
management expects this expense percentage to be fairly consistent in operating profit was of sales for fiscal  however  operating profit trended downward during the last quarter of the fiscal year due to inadequate repair  maintenance and tooling programs as well as resources dedicated to the start up of two new part manufacturing programs 
in addition to improving production  management is considering a repricing of certain parts 
management anticipates that milford s ongoing operating loss situation will be resolved in the quarter ending march  through price adjustments and improvements in operations 
corporate expenses unallocated corporate overhead was  in   in  and  in the increase in expense reflects additional administrative and personnel expense  primarily related to the establishment of new computer systems  higher amortization related to the financing completed mid and higher professional fee expense 
interest expense  miscellaneous income and income taxes interest expense was million in   in  and million in the increase in interest expense in compared to resulted from higher term debt to finance equipment and higher line of credit borrowings used for working capital 
the decline in interest expense in from resulted from lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates for the year 
other income expense was negligible for the periods presented   in  and  in  and  in income tax expense benefit was  in   in  and  in the higher income tax expense reflects the federal statutory rates adjusted for permanent differences between financial carrying amounts and tax carrying amounts 
the income tax benefit in was the result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against taxable income and the reversal of portions of the valuation allowance in anticipation of future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
financial condition the company s working capital position improved to million at september   from million at september  and from million at september  the increase in working capital in compared to was attributable to the addition of the milford operation 
the increase in working capital in from primarily resulted from a refinancing of long term debt  as excess proceeds of approximately million from new long term debt were used to reduce short term borrowings and the exercise of stock purchase warrants that provided million in additional equity  proceeds of which were also used to reduce short term borrowings 
scheduled debt payments due in fiscal total approximately million and management believes that internally generated cash from operations  amounts available on bank lines of credit and proceeds from possible dispositions of underperforming assets will provide sufficient cash flow to cover the scheduled debt payments as well as fund continuing working capital requirements 
cash flows for  and are summarized as follows cash flows from operating activities    cash flows used in investing activities    cash flows from used in financing activities    cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities before changes in working capital items and discontinued operations were million in  million in  and million in working capital items used million in  as accounts receivable were established at milford  partially offset by the establishment of normal accounts payables at milford 
in  working capital items used  as inventories rose million  partially offset by lower accounts receivable and higher accrued liabilities 
in  working capital items used  primarily the result of higher accounts receivable and prepaid items and lower accounts payable 
cash flows used in investing activities in  capital expenditures totaled million 
these expenditures primarily relate to equipment acquired to machine starter motor shafts for an automotive parts supplier  which represents a new line of manufacturing for the company 
the new line  which consists of machining  heat treating  grinding and drilling  is located at the milford operation 
also in  the milford acquisition transaction november  used million in cash and received million in lieu of product price increases 
in  capital expenditures totaled million primarily for the manufacture of additional transmission component parts for sale to an automotive customer 
in  capital expenditures were million  principally for a refurbished hydraulic press dedicated for airbag housing production and form flow s expansion of its die repair business  which included the acquisition of a new facility and additional grinding equipment 
the company received  in   in  and  in from the disposals of machinery and equipment 
disposals in were negligible  while in and the reductions principally reflect the downsizing of the triple unit 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million in  million in  and million in in  proceeds from the company s bank revolving line of credit provided million in cash to provide working capital requirements and short term financing related to various capital projects 
also in  million in term debt financing was principally utilized to finance existing machinery at milford  computers in all business segments and machinery at uniflow 
in  the company completed a major debt refinancing of its existing assets and secured million in industrial development bond financing to fund new equipment purchases associated with new sales orders 
the refinancing included a million note with a bank finance company due in six years  a real estate mortgage of million due in years  and a million collateralized bank line of credit  of which million is a committed revolver that expires in also in  the company received million and reduced accrued interest by  through the exercise of two stock warrants  which resulted in the issuance of million shares of common stock 
in  scheduled principal debt payments totaled million  compared to scheduled payments of million in and million in also  in the company extinguished a million note payable in connection with the exercise of a stock warrant
