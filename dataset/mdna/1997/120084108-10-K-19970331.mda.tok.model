in  the company recorded operating income of million and a net loss of million  after cumulative effect of an accounting change loss per share 
the operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues was for compared to for the increased operating ratio resulted from the following operating revenues suffered from an inability to obtain adequate rate relief to cover inflationary costs  primarily driver wages 
wages  salaries and employee benefits as a percentage of revenues increased  due to an increase in driver wages and workers compensation costs that were partially offset by a reduction in non driver employees  an increase in the use of owner operators  and the closing of the tire loading and warehousing operations 
driver wages increased one cent per mile in january workers compensation costs increased million compared to  primarily  as a result of an increase in the frequency and severity of accidents and injuries due in part to the bad winter weather in early operations and maintenance expenses increased percent due to a substantial increase in fuel  repair and tire costs 
fuel costs increased million  repair costs increased million and tire costs increased million during insurance and claim expenses rose percent due to the number and severity of accidents during and the high amount required to settle several of the claims 
this resulted in upward revisions in some open claims files 
depreciation and equipment rents increased ten percent due to the pace of depreciation accompanying the company s equipment replacement program 
depreciation expenses included a full year s depreciation on equipment acquired in  as well as  a partial year s depreciation on equipment added in increased reliance on owner operators partially offset this increase 
rents and purchased transportation costs increased percent reflecting the continued increase in use of owner operators 
the number of owner operators employed by the company increased to  on average  during in the average number of owner operators employed by the company was this increase caused a redistribution of certain costs from expense categories related to company owned equipment fuel  driver wages  depreciation  etc 
to the rents and purchased transportation expense account

the company expects to generate future taxable income to realize the remaining net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the company s revenue growth was negatively impacted by the weakened freight demand that was experienced industry wide during the company s van and flatbed divisions were more significantly affected by the weakened demand than was the dedicated fleet division 
rather than depending on gradual improvement in the overall market  the company more aggressively added new business during late and early except for the impact of severe weather experienced early in  the company s current volume has improved substantially as a result of this marketing program 
it is expected that volume should increase further during as the company began service in march on new dedicated contracts that have annual revenues of approximately million 
during  the company recorded operating income of million and a net loss of million loss per share 
in  the company recorded operating income of million and net income of million

results for were affected by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards number  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which resulted in an million after tax charge per share 
during  the company initiated a plan to dispose of certain older revenue equipment and to significantly reduce the average age of its fleet 
throughout the company had been actively disposing of its older equipment 
the modernization plan is expected to be completed during the adoption of sfas no 
as of january   requires the company to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the extent the carrying value of the affected assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
results for also include pre tax special charges of million  after tax  or 
per share associated with the sale and closing of its tire loading and warehousing operations in february these operations generated less than of the company s total revenues 
however  the operating loss from these operations was approximately  in the withdrawal from these unprofitable activities should have a positive impact on results of operations in see note to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the cumulative effect of the accounting changes and the special charges and operations relating to the tire loading and warehousing operation  the net income for was million 
per share and operating income was million 
the operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues was for as compared to for if the special charges and operations associated with the tire loading and warehousing business were excluded  the operating ratio for would have been 
the increased operating ratio resulted from unfavorable claims settlement experience and weakened freight demand 
wages  salaries and employee benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly  due to a reduction in non driver employees and an increase in the use of owner operators that was partly offset by increased driver training related salary costs 
the reduction in non driver staffing occurred in mid and was made in response to the weakened freight demand experienced industry wide 
operations and maintenance related expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased  primarily as a result of maintenance cost reductions attributable to the replacement of approximately  five to eight year old tractors with new tractors 
these costs were further reduced by the increased use of owner operators  who pay their own fuel and maintenance expenses 
insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenues rose  as a result of a claim settlement at an unanticipated level that cost the company million and as a result of general upward revisions in other open claims 
the million claim settlement was unique in the company s experience in terms of both its size and its impact on results of operations 
the company has increased its liability insurance limit to million primarily in response to this loss 
management expects that insurance claim expenses will stabilize near a more traditional level in the future  as this unprecedented claim was fully settled during depreciation and equipment rents as a percentage of revenue decreased principally as a result of increased use of owner operators  certain groups of assets becoming fully depreciated during the year  the disposal of under utilized assets and the adoption of sfas rents and purchased transportation increased to of revenue from in  reflecting the continued increase in the number of owner operators used 
the increase in owner operators caused a redistribution of certain costs from expense categories related to company owned equipment fuel  driver wages  depreciation  etc 
to the rents and purchased transportation expense account 
interest and other expenses rose to million  principally due to the additional interest charges associated with the debt incurred as a result of the company s equipment replacement program 
the company expects that interest expense will increase slightly during as a full year s interest charges will be incurred on the debt added in liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations decreased to million in from million during the company s cash flows and cash requirements tend to fluctuate during the year 
generally more cash is required during the first part of the year  primarily to fund the company s annual prepayments of operating taxes and licenses 
cash flow from operations generally increases consistently beginning in the second quarter through year end 
the company uses its revolving credit facility to smooth cyclical cash flows associated with its operations 
outstanding borrowings under the revolver increased to million at december   compared to million at december  borrowing availability after a january amendment was million 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the million revolving credit facility  the other items available in the million credit agreement were a million term loan and an irrevocable letter of credit facility of up to million 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to a specified percentage of customer accounts receivable  as defined in the credit agreement  or million  whichever is less 
the interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement is prime plus 
fees on outstanding letters of credit are per annum  and fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit and letter of credit facilities are per annum 
the credit agreement obligations are secured by substantially all the company s assets that are not collateralized under other financing agreements 
the credit agreement includes certain financial covenants and restrictions on payments of dividends  capital expenditures  indebtedness and the sale of certain assets  all of which the company anticipates that it should be able to comply with in the foreseeable future 
the  term portion of the credit agreement is payable in installments of  for the second and third quarters of with a final payment of  in december the entire credit agreement is scheduled to expire at december  traditionally  the company has replaced its then existing credit agreements well in advance of their scheduled maturities in response to changing needs and credit environments 
based on past experience and its relationships with its current lead lender  builders anticipates that it should be able to negotiate an extension to  or replacement of  the current credit agreement well in advance of scheduled maturities  if necessary 
management believes that cash flows generated from operations will be adequate to meet cash requirements for on a longer term basis  the company believes it has the ability to finance its capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures during were million including capitalized leases of million 
these capital expenditures and capital leases were primarily for new  more efficient revenue equipment that replaced older equipment that was sold 
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment amounted to million 
the company has adopted a very conservative capital expenditure budget for  due to the newer fleet 
the company has not made any capital purchase commitments 
as a result of the reduced capital expenditure budget for  the company currently plans to repay a significant amount of equipment debt during the company will remain highly leveraged for the foreseeable future  however  without a significant equity infusion 
the majority of the company s debt relates to equipment financing and is closely matched with the expected useful lives of the equipment collateralizing the debt 
see factors that may affect future results recent developments and trends 
at december   the company had available for issuance and not otherwise reserved million authorized shares of its 
per share par value common stock and  authorized shares of its 
per share par value preferred stock 
this stock could be issued  at any time  in connection with an acquisition  to increase working capital  or for any other business purpose deemed appropriate by the board of directors 
currently  there are no specific plans for the use of the available authorized stock 
seasonality in the trucking industry generally  results of operations reflect a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter  holiday season and its attendant weather variations 
accordingly  without growth in business  the first and fourth quarters of a year would account for less revenue and net income than the second and third quarters 
builders quarterly results have traditionally reflected this seasonality 
moreover  the extent of these seasonal variations can change significantly from one year to the next depending  particularly  on the severity of winter weather and its impact on travel conditions and the economy 
impact of inflation inflation has in the past been  and may in the future be  a significant factor in the economy 
while the company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on its results of operations in  builders continues to monitor closely the impact of inflation  if any  and to optimize its impact on prevailing price trends 
equipment 
the service lives of the company s revenue equipment are relatively short five to ten years  and a regular cycle of equipment replacement ensures that depreciation  as reported in the financial statements  reasonably approximates current costs 
this tends to neutralize  over time  the impact of inflation in the cost of new equipment on results of operations 
fuel 
the cost and availability of fuel is significant to builders results of operations 
historically  the company has never experienced a situation in which fuel shortages were so severe that adequate supplies could not be obtained  nor is the company aware of this having ever been the case for other companies in the truckload segment of the industry 
fuel shortages do impact prices  however  and from time to time in the past  fuel costs have been volatile 
during fuel prices soared 
prices peaked in late and early and have recently dropped  although not to the level of january when fuel prices have spiked in the past  the company and others in the industry have been able to ameliorate  to some extent  the negative effect on results of operations by imposing fuel surcharges 
shippers acceptance of fuel surcharges typically lags behind the increase in fuel prices 
thus  the level of such surcharges is sometimes not sufficient to offset totally the negative impact of the increased costs until fuel prices recede toward their historic norms 
this was the case in as the company was able to offset only approximately of the increase in fuel costs through surcharges compared to current recoveries of to 
the company tries to minimize fuel costs by purchasing in bulk 
builder s bulk purchase program is facilitated by its  gallon active storage capacity at terminals 
additionally  the company has a network of authorized truck stops  where it has negotiated fuel pump prices at an average wholesale rack price plus a small pumping fee for the vendor 
the company believes that this pricing arrangement helps to prevent the vendor from realizing excessive retail profit margins in certain less competitive areas 
the company has hedged its fuel costs on a limited basis in the past  and is currently considering hedging part of its fuel requirements 
environmental matters the environmental protection agency and various state environmental regulatory agencies regulate the company s operations with respect to matters involving water quality and effluent limitation  underground storage tanks and the handling  storage and disposal of solid waste and hazardous materials 
capital expenditures include amounts spent for various environmental matters 
in addition  the company provides for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable based on case by case consultation with environmental specialists 
receivables relating to claims for recovery are recorded only when realization is probable 
recorded recoveries were not material at december  capital expenditures for all environmental control efforts were not material in  and they are not expected to be material in forward looking statements statements in this document that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provided by section e of the securities exchange act of and section a of the securities act of the company cautions readers that such forward looking statements  including without limitation  those relating to the company s future business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  capital needs  interest costs and income  wherever they occur in this document or in other statements attributable to the company are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of the company s senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements should  therefore  be considered in light of various important factors including those set forth below and others set forth from time to time in the company s reports and registration statements filed with the sec 
these forward looking statements are found at various places throughout this document 
additionally  the foregoing discussions under liquidity and capital resources  seasonality  impact of inflation  and environmental matters are susceptible to the risks and uncertainties discussed below 
moreover  the company through its senior management may from time to time make forward looking statements about the matters described herein or other matters concerning the company 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward looking statements 
factors that may affect future results the company s future operating results may be affected by a number of factors such as uncertainties relative to economic conditions  industry factors including  among others  competition  rate pressure  driver availability and fuel prices  and  the company s ability to sell its services profitably  successfully increase market share in its core businesses and effectively manage expense growth relative to revenue growth in anticipation of continued pressure on gross margins 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected should the company be unable to anticipate customer demand accurately or to effectively manage the impact on the company of changes in the trucking  transportation and logistics industries 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past financial performances should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
recent developments and trends 
the company s recent freight volume has been relatively strong 
while the company is more optimistic about future business levels  the company cannot predict whether this positive trend will continue 
the company has been focusing on opportunities within the company to enhance revenue  to reduce operating costs and to improve the productivity of the work force 
recently  the company has been successful in obtaining meaningful rate increases from a significant portion of its customers 
the company has made consistent progress for several months toward manning its empty tractors  and by mid march  they were fully manned 
the company has been successful in implementing fuel surcharges and is now recovering to of the additional cost of fuel that resulted from the price increases 
fuel prices appear to be declining from their peak in late and early this past winter was relatively mild in the company s operating areas 
through mid march  accidents have decreased substantially 
of course  this favorable trend may or may not continue 
during the latter part of the company has identified numerous areas of potential cost reduction that  in the aggregate  should save the company approximately million in most of these cost saving measures were in place by mid march the company is working on all of these activities simultaneously and expects to see a noticeable improvement in its operating results by the second quarter of in late march  the company retained alex 
brown sons incorporated as financial advisor to review various alternatives with respect to restructuring certain of the company s debt obligations 
the company announced that it expected to begin preliminary discussions shortly with its equipment lessors and lenders and with representatives of the holders of its two series of convertible subordinated debentures
