the company believes that specializing in structural concrete construction has contributed significantly to its revenue growth and provides it with an advantage in the competitive bidding process 
however  such specialization limits the types and sizes of projects upon which the company bids and may be a competitive disadvantage for projects in which the amount of work proposed to be completed by the prime contractor as compared to the amount of work which will be subcontracted by the prime contractor is a consideration in the bidding process 
the company primarily seeks public sector customers because public sector projects are less cyclical than private sector projects  payment is more reliable  work required by the project is generally standardized and little marketing expense is incurred in obtaining projects

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for capital has been to finance growth in its core business as a heavy construction contractor and its expansion into the other construction and construction related businesses heretofore discussed 
annual revenue has grown from approximately million in to million in growth has resulted in the need for additional capital to finance increased receivables  retentions and capital expenditures  and to address fluctuations in the work in process billing cycle  wherein costs and estimated earnings on contracts in progress have exceeded billings 
the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain items from the statements of cash flows of the company and mvc 
years ended december  combined cash flows provided by used in operating activities    cash flows provided by used in investing activities    cash flows provided by used in financing activities    although the company may experience increased profitability as operations increase  cash may be reduced to finance receivables and for customer cash retention required under contracts subject to completion 
management continually monitors the company s cash requirements to maintain adequate cash reserves  and the company believes that its cash balances were and  together with the operating lines of credit described below  are sufficient 
cash used in operating activities increased million during the years to the increased is primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable and net costs in excess of billings billings of million  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million along with interest payments related to the mvc acquisition of 
million and income tax payments in the amount of million 
the outstanding accounts receivable and billings have increased primarily due to growth in revenue and increased retentions related to large volume projects 
the company contracts primarily with public sector customers  which it believes significantly reduces exposure to conventional bad debts 
accordingly  based on the company s history of no material delays in the collection of accounts receivable  no allowance was established for potentially uncollectible accounts at december  for the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities amounted to million  primarily as a result of cash acquired through purchase of a subsidiary of million  offset by loans to related parties of

million and repayment of 
million of loans to related parties 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities amounted to

at december   nothing had been drawn on either of the lines of credit 
under the lines of credit  the company is required to maintain certain levels of working capital  to promptly pay all its obligations and is precluded from conveying  selling or leasing all or substantially all of its assets 
at december   the company was in full compliance with all such covenants and there are no material covenants or restrictions in the lines of credit which the company believes would impair its operations 
the lines of credit expire august  the company anticipates incurring total costs related to the ready mix operations of approximately million which include the acquisition of land  equipment and batch plant 
the batch plant and its related equipment in the amount of approximately million will be financed primarily through operating leases 
the land totaling approximately million will be financed through bank notes and or other financial instruments  which include approximately  of capital expenditures and a  million land note financed during in addition  the company is currently leasing approximately ready mix trucks with estimated annual lease payments of the company anticipates incurring total costs of approximately

accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market price of the company s stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock

the new standard provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the company does not expect adoption to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations 
however  substantial increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect the operations of the company for future periods 
known and anticipated future trends and contingencies with the completion of the public offering in october and the corresponding influx of capital  the company s bonding limits were raised to approximately million per single project and million aggregate 
subject to the company s profitability and increases in retained earnings  it is anticipated that the bonding limits will increase proportionately  thereby allowing the company to bid on and perform more and larger projects 
the company believes that the trend toward government funding of the transportation system will continue 
the passage of the istea bill in was intended to establish a strategic direction for future transportation development in the united states 
the creation of the national highway system in with corresponding funding is an indication of this trend 
the current istea bill is due for reauthorization in  and it is believed that the current legislation  with necessary modifications  will likely be passed by congress 
a number of state legislatures are addressing transportation funding by allowing the construction of toll roads  and design build contracts 
these contracts tend to be larger million billion and therefore attract larger contractors  joint ventures  or consortiums of firms 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by all levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads  quasi public toll roads  and others are all examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
seasonality the construction industry is seasonal  generally due to inclement weather occurring in the winter months 
accordingly  the company may experience a seasonal pattern in its operating results with lower revenue in the first quarter of each calendar year than other quarters 
quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of bid solicitations by governmental authorities  the stage of completion of major projects and revenue recognition policies 
results for any one quarter  therefore  may not be indicative of results for other quarters or for the year
