realization of the asset is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable earnings to utilize the nol 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that firstcity will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the tax benefit recognized 
prior to the second quarter of  the deferred tax asset resulting from the company s nol was entirely offset by this valuation reserve 
in the second quarter of  the valuation reserve was reduced based on estimates of future income 
the amount of tax benefits recognized will be adjusted in future periods should the estimates of future taxable income change

liquidity and capital resources the following table analyzes the components of portfolio and corporate debt  capital positions at the company and in the acquisition partnerships and associated leverage ratios of firstcity and the acquisition partnerships analysis of combined debt and equity dollars in thousands average debt outstanding borrowing by acquisition partnerships  non recourse   borrowings secured by purchased asset pools  non recourse   borrowings secured by automobile receivables  non recourse  senior subordinated notes  with recourse   other secured corporate borrowings  with recourse   total average debt outstanding   combined equity at year end firstcity financial corporation   minority interest in acquisition partnerships   total equity   analysis of combined debt and equity dollars in thousands leverage ratios average debt to combined equity average debt excluding senior subordinated debt to combined equity average cost of funds borrowing by acquisition partnerships  non recourse borrowings secured by purchased asset pools  non recourse borrowings secured by automobile receivables  non recourse senior subordinated notes  with recourse other secured corporate borrowings  with recourse generally  the liquidity needs of firstcity are for operations  payment of debt  equity for acquisitions of purchased asset pools  investments in and advances to acquisition partnerships and other investments by the company 
the sources of liquidity are funds generated from operations  distributions from the trust to the company as the sole holder of the trust class a certificate  equity distributions from acquisition partnerships and short term borrowings from revolving lines of credit and other specific purpose short term borrowings 
firstcity contributed equity to acquisition partnerships totaling million to facilitate the purchase of million in portfolios of assets during and also acquired million in purchased asset pools 
in  firstcity borrowed million and repaid million under a credit facility provided by cargill  increasing the balance under that facility to million at year end 
such facility matures on june   and is secured by substantially all of the unencumbered equity interest in subsidiaries and acquisition partnerships and certain other assets of the company 
in  naf borrowed million under a million warehouse credit agreement with contitrade services llc to purchase and originate auto loans through naf 
as the origination of auto loans increases  naf can borrow under this facility and repay with the proceeds of securitizations 
increases in loan originations may require additional equity infusions into naf to comply with the borrowing base terms of the warehouse credit agreement 
on march   firstcity redeemed early million of its senior subordinated notes by means of a distribution from the trust 
during the second quarter of  million of notes held by the trust were redeemed 
on july   the remaining million of notes were redeemed via another distribution from the trust 
in the fourth quarter of  firstcity paid via trust distribution million accrued dividends through september  on special preferred stock 
on january   firstcity paid the accrued dividend of million for the fourth quarter of subsequent to december   the company purchased approximately million of special preferred stock with a distribution from the trust 
each of these transactions resulted in a corresponding reduction in the trust class a certificate 
in the future  firstcity anticipates being able to raise capital through public debt or equity offerings  thus enhancing the investment and growth opportunities of the company 
the company believes that these and other sources of liquidity  including refinancing the cargill credit facility to the extent necessary  securitizations  and funding from senior lenders providing funding for acquisition partnership formation and direct portfolio and business acquisitions  should prove adequate to continue to fund the company s contemplated investment activities 
at december   total common equity was million and is considered by management adequate to support the current capital requirements and planned growth of the company 
common and preferred stock data firstcity s common fcfc and special preferred fcfcp shares were listed on the nasdaq national market system effective november   and were traded over the counter beginning july  the number of common stockholders of record on december   was approximately high and low stock prices and dividends in and are displayed in the following table cash quarter ended market price dividends market price common stock high low paid high low march june september december special preferred stock march june september december beginning july   the date of the merger 
accrued dividend from july  through september  the company believes that the best use of its available cash is investment in purchased asset pools  acquisition partnerships or other investment opportunities  therefore  no dividends have been paid on common stock and none are expected to be paid in the foreseeable future 
a dividend of 
per share on special preferred stock for the fourth quarter of was paid on january  fourth quarter net earnings for the fourth quarter of were million  including a million deferred tax benefit

the following table presents a summary of operations for the fourth quarters of and condensed consolidated summary of operations fourth fourth dollars in thousands  except per share data quarter quarter income   expenses   equity earnings of acquisition partnerships   earnings before income taxes   provision benefit for income taxes  net earnings   special preferred dividends   net earnings to common   net earnings per share the reductions in income and expenses from the fourth quarter of to that of were caused primarily by the absence of million of interest on senior subordinated notes and corresponding interest income on class a certificate that were redeemed earlier in equity in earnings of acquisition partnerships was relatively flat 
a deferred tax benefit of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of effect of new accounting standards effective january   firstcity adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
neither of these standards had a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of firstcity 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december  and is to be applied prospectively 
this statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
it distinguishes transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
management does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
risk factors firstcity s future results of operations are dependent upon a number of factors differences between projected and actual cash flows of purchased asset pools  continued availability of potential asset pool acquisitions  availability of net operating loss carry forwards  changes in interest rates  continuation of current business affiliation with cargill  sources of financing and general economic conditions 
differences between projected and actual cash flows of purchased asset pools 
many of the assumptions upon which the future collections in purchased asset pools are based are subject to significant uncertainties  some assumptions will inevitably be incorrect 
additionally  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
there will always be differences between projected and actual results because of these unanticipated events and circumstances 
continued availability of potential asset pool acquisitions 
firstcity believes that financial institutions and other lenders will continue to offer asset pools as a result of their continuing consolidation and investor and regulatory pressure to dispose of non performing and under performing assets 
however  changes in the regulatory environment could cause the increased asset pool sales to decline in the future 
availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
although firstcity believes that the net operating loss carry forwards are available to offset future taxable earnings of firstcity  there is no authority governing many of the tax aspects of the merger primarily because some determinations may be questions of fact 
additionally  no ruling has been obtained from the internal revenue service regarding the availability of the net operating loss carry forwards to firstcity  therefore there can be no assurances that the tax aspects of the merger and the availability of the net operating loss carry forwards will not be challenged by the internal revenue service 
changes in interest rates 
most of the indebtedness incurred by firstcity and its acquisition partnerships is floating rate debt  the rates of which change when certain short term benchmark rates increase 
if these benchmark rates increase beyond what firstcity had originally projected  the profitability of firstcity and the acquisition partnerships will be adversely affected 
continuation of the current business affiliation with cargill 
firstcity attributes a significant portion of its recent financial success to its affiliation with cargill 
participation by cargill in a transaction provides assurances to any potential seller of a portfolio of distressed assets that firstcity will have the financial ability to consummate the targeted portfolio acquisition 
in addition  firstcity believes that cargill s general reputation in the financial markets provides firstcity with more opportunities to acquire portfolios than firstcity would otherwise have acting alone 
discontinuation of this arrangement with cargill could have a negative economic impact upon the continued results of operations of firstcity 
sources of financing 
firstcity s continued success in its distressed asset acquisition business is dependent upon the availability of senior debt financing for the acquisition partnerships 
although firstcity continues to enjoy good relationships with its current lenders and to develop new sources of senior debt financing  there can be no assurances that these and other sources of senior debt financing will be available in the future 
general economic conditions 
when firstcity acquires an asset pool  cash flows and sale prices are projected based upon the economic conditions then prevailing and projected in the united states and in the economic region in which the asset is situated 
if such economic conditions substantially deteriorate  firstcity s earnings from its then existing asset portfolios may be adversely affected  but additional opportunities to acquire new asset portfolios will be expected to be available
