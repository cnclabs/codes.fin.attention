overview rofin sinar is a leader in the design  development  engineering  manufacture and marketing of laser based products used for cutting  welding and marking a wide range of industrial materials 
during fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were from sales and servicing of laser products for cutting and welding applications and approximately were from sales and servicing of laser products for marking applications 
dilas acquisition in august  rofin sinar acquired of the common stock of dilas diodenlaser gmbh dilas  a german limited liability company based in mainz  germany  for million 
dilas designs and manufactures diode lasers and components for a wide range of material processing applications and sells them to the machine tool  automotive  and semiconductor and electronics markets  as well as to the research  measurement and medical instruments industries 
the dilas acquisition was accounted for on a purchase accounting basis 
through its acquisition of the dilas shares  the company adds new technology and a new product line to its already wide range of industrial lasers 
the linking of dilas production expertise and rofin sinar s ongoing research program in cooperation with the fraunhofer institute for laser technology  in aachen germany  is expected to speed up the introduction of new diode based laser systems for material processing applications 
the company s business strategy continues to include the expansion of its products and services  which may be effected through acquisitions 
the company from time to time reviews various opportunities to acquire businesses  technologies or products complementary to the company s present business 
currency exchange rates although the company reports its consolidated financial statements in us dollars  approximately two thirds of its sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily german marks  as well as french francs  italian lire and japanese yen 
net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to united states dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
due to the strengthening of the us dollar against such foreign currencies during fiscal and  the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity changed from a million credit at september  to a million debit at september  the fluctuation of the german mark and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold and gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods 
the following table illustrates the effect of the changes in exchange rates on the company s fiscal   and net sales  gross profit and income from operations 
fiscal in exchange actual rates in millions net sales gross profit income from operations fiscal in exchange actual rates in millions net sales gross profit income from operations fiscal in exchange actual rates in millions net sales gross profit income from operations between fiscal and  the german mark strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this strengthening of the german mark was to increase net sales  gross profit and income from operations by  and million  respectively 
between fiscal and  the german mark weakened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this weakening of the german mark was to decrease net sales  gross profit and income from operations by  and million  respectively 
between fiscal and  the german mark weakened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this weakening was to decrease net sales  gross profit and income from operations by   and million  respectively 
the company has implemented a policy to hedge up to of its net foreign currency exposure on sales transactions utilizing forward exchange contracts 
the company has also implemented a policy to continue to borrow in each operating subsidiary s functional currency to reduce its exposure to foreign currency gains and losses 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
taxes the company s subsidiaries pay taxes in many jurisdictions and the provisions for income taxes in the company s consolidated financial statements are based on separate local tax computations 
on a consolidated basis  this practice may result in the company incurring income tax expense even though it may not have consolidated pre tax income or in paying taxes in excess of pre tax income if some of its subsidiaries are not profitable while others are 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in particular  because of the company s substantial operations in germany  the company historically has had a higher effective tax rate than many of its competitors who do not have operations in germany 
the company currently generates taxable income  principally in germany and the united states 
german corporate tax law applies the imputation system with regard to the taxation of the income of a corporation such as rsl 
in general  retained corporate income is subject to a municipal trade tax which for hamburg and gunding on a combined basis is  and for mainz is  which is deductible for federal corporate income tax purposes  a federal corporate income tax of and  effective january   a surcharge of on the federal corporate income tax amount 
profits which are distributed by a german corporate taxpayer such as rsl in the form of a dividend are subject to a reduced federal corporate income tax rate of plus the surcharge on the federal corporate income tax amount calculated at the reduced rate 
dividends paid by rsl to rofin sinar technologies inc will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of pursuant to the income tax treaty currently in effect between the united states and germany 
restructuring the machine tool industry experienced a significant downturn during the global recession in the early s as end users  particularly in the heavy manufacturing industries  reduced their investment in new technologies and postponed modernizing their production facilities in the face of adverse business conditions

this restructuring was completed in fiscal the company experienced significant financial improvement during fiscal through  primarily reflecting improving economic conditions  the benefits of the restructuring undertaken in and and the implementation of the company s current business strategy 
the growth in the company s net sales since fiscal has allowed the company to realize improved operating leverage by producing larger unit volumes over relatively lower costs and by negotiating more favorable terms for purchases of components and subassemblies 
while the company expects to continue to see growth in fiscal and  there can be no assurance that the company s rate of growth experienced during the period will be maintained
