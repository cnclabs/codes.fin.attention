item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in april  gsi has been engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of balloon dissection systems and related minimally invasive surgical instruments 
the company began commercial sales of its balloon dissection systems for hernia repair in september to date  the company has received from the fda five k clearances for use of the company s technology to perform dissection of tissue planes anywhere in the body using a broad range of balloon sizes and shapes 
the company currently sells products in the united states and certain other countries in europe  asia and south america for selected applications  such as hernia repair  subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery and breast augmentation and reconstruction surgery 
in march  the company entered into a distribution agreement with ussc providing ussc with limited exclusive rights to distribute the company s balloon dissection systems in the hernia repair market in both the united states and certain international countries 
in november  the company terminated its distribution agreement with ussc 
in december  the company entered into a five year oem supply agreement the expanded ees agreement with ees  pursuant to which gsi granted ees worldwide sales and marketing rights to sell the spacemaker tm balloon dissection systems in the laparoscopic hernia repair and urinary stress incontinence usi markets 
the expanded ees agreement supersedes the june licensing agreement between the company and ees 
ees has begun selling gsi s dissector for hernia repair 
ees made guaranteed payments of million  million and million in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  which represents a combination of purchased products and margin guarantees under the expanded ees agreement 
additional sales in the united states are currently made through a small direct sales force 
the company currently sells its products other than for hernia and usi applications in international markets through a limited number of distributors  which resell to surgeons and hospitals 
the company plans to increase its direct sales force in the united states and may seek to establish a direct sales force in one or more other countries in the future 
any increase in the company s direct sales force will require significant expenditures and additional management resources 
to date  all of the sales to distributors and almost all of the sales by the company s direct sales force have been for use in hernia repair procedures 
while the company has developed or is developing balloon dissection systems for urinary stress incontinence  vascular  plastic surgery and orthopedic applications  sales of products for hernia repair are expected to provide a majority of the company s revenues at least through fiscal the company has acquired rights to a significant number of patents from third parties  including rights that apply to the company s current balloon dissection systems 
the company has historically paid and is obligated to pay in the future to such third parties royalties equal to of sales of such products  which payments are expected to exceed certain minimum royalty payments due under the agreements with such parties 
the company has also acquired patent rights under royalty bearing agreements with respect to certain surgical instruments  including the knotmaker product and the balloon valve trocar 
the payment of such royalty amounts will have an adverse impact on the company s gross profit and results of operations 
the company has a limited history of operations and has experienced significant operating losses since inception 
the company expects such operating losses to continue at least through march  the company s sales to date have consisted primarily of balloon dissector systems for hernia repair 
in order to support increased levels of sales in the future and to augment its long term competitive position  including the development of balloon dissection systems for other applications  the company anticipates that it will be required to make significant additional expenditures in sales and marketing and research and development including marketing related clinical evaluations 
in addition  the company has experienced higher administration expenses since its initial public offering resulting from its obligations as a public reporting company 
the company anticipates that its results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including fluctuations in purchases of the company s products by ees  ees s ability to achieve certain levels of sales growth  the status of the company s relationship with ees or other partners  the company s ability to develop and sell its line of cardiovascular products  fluctuations in revenues among different product lines and markets  the mix of sales among the distributors and the company s direct sales force  timing of new product introductions or transitions to new products  the margins recognized from products for various surgical procedures  the progress of marketing related clinical evaluations  sales of competitive products and the introduction of new products from competitors including pricing pressures  activities related to patents and patent approvals including litigation and regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  and the timing of research and development expenses including marketing related clinical evaluations 
in addition  the company s results of operations could be affected by the timing and number of orders from distributors  expansion of the company s distributor network  the ability of the company s distributors to effectively promote the company s products and the ability of the company to quickly and cost effectively increase its direct domestic sales force 
the company s limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
the company currently manufactures and ships product shortly after the receipt of orders  and anticipates that it will do so in the future 
accordingly  the company has not developed a significant backlog and does not anticipate that it will develop a material backlog in the future 
in january  the company entered into a new facility lease in cupertino  california and relocated its headquarters and manufacturing operations to this new location in april the new facility s lease comprises approximately  square feet  and the monthly rent is approximately  results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from the company s consolidated statement of operations  expressed as a percentage of sales and guaranteed payments as a percentage of sales and guaranteed payments years ended june  sales guaranteed payments total revenue cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income expense  net net loss years ended june  and sales and guaranteed payments 
sales and guaranteed payments totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over sales and guaranteed payments of million in fiscal this increase in revenues is due to guaranteed payments of million from ees during its first year as the company s new major distributor 
these guaranteed payments will not continue to be made in fiscal product sales accounted for million of total revenues in fiscal  which represents a decrease from fiscal this decrease reflects lower levels of sales in the hernia market due to competition in this market and the transition to ees as its major distributor 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was related to the lower level of product sales which the company experienced 
direct product costs were of total product sales in fiscal  an increase of from fiscal  as a result of spreading certain fixed overhead expenses over a lower number of unit sales in fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses for fiscal increased to million versus million for the year ending june  as the company continued to develop products for its expanding vascular market and developing orthopedic market 
the company expects to continue to increase r d expenses as it pursues additional market opportunities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in fiscal year  an increase of as compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily related to expanding gsi s sales presence  both domestically and internationally  and increased litigation expenses related to the origin medsystem infringement case 
gsi expects sg a expenses to continue to increase as the company s level of sales increases and the company continues to administratively support growth 
net loss 
the company had a net loss of approximately million in fiscal compared to a million net loss in fiscal primarily due to the effect of the guaranteed payments from ees and interest income 
years ended june  and sales 
sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the growth in unit sales of the spacemaker i platform to ussc for the hernia market and  to a lesser extent  from sales of the spacemaker ii platform  which was introduced in october cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of sales to in the period from in the period 
this increase in absolute dollars was primarily a result of the costs of additional manufacturing capacity and personnel to support increased sales volume  which was offset by leveraging certain fixed overhead expenses across a higher base of sales 
research and development expenses

sg a expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the growth of a direct sales force in the united states and the growth in marketing and other personnel associated with the company s higher levels of operations 
net loss 
the company had a net loss of million in the year ended june  compared to a net loss of million in the year ended june  the net loss reflected a one time expense related to the write off of acquired in process research and development of million  incurred in connection with the company s acquisition of adjacent surgical  inc in february quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for the fiscal year ended june   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of the company s total revenue

in the past  the company s sales were highly dependent upon the marketing efforts and success of united states surgical corporation  which was the company s major distributor until the relationship was mutually terminated in november in december  the company entered into the expanded ethicon agreement  pursuant to which gsi granted ees worldwide sales and marketing rights to sell the spacemaker tm balloon dissection systems in the laparoscopic hernia repair and urinary stress incontinence usi markets 
the company s sales in any period will be highly dependent upon the marketing efforts and success of ees  which are not within the control of the company 
ees made approximately million in guaranteed payments to the company in fiscal year  which constituted of revenues for fiscal year ees is not obligated to make any such guaranteed payments in future quarters 
the company anticipates that sales to ees will fluctuate in the future 
failure by ees to achieve certain levels of sales growth or a decline in purchases by ees could result in a decline in sales and adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  announcements or expected announcements by the company  its competitors or its distributor of new products  new technologies or pricing changes could cause existing or potential customers of the company to defer purchases of the company s existing products and could alter the mix of products sold by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that future products or product enhancements will be successfully introduced or that such introductions will not adversely affect the demand for existing products 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past  and the company expects that such results may fluctuate in the future 
due to such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  quarter to quarter comparisons of the company s operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of likely future performance or annual operating results 
in addition  the company s limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible to make 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will achieve sales growth or become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis  if at all  or that its growth  if any  will be consistent with predictions by securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s cash expenditures have significantly exceeded its sales  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million at june  the company has funded its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
from its inception through june  the company raised approximately million through the private placement of equity securities and approximately million net of underwriting discounts and commissions in an initial public offering 
as of june  the company s principal source of liquidity consists of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in addition  the company has a bank line of credit available for  as of june   the company has no amounts outstanding under this line 
the company also has an equipment loan with a balance of approximately  under a previous bank line of credit 
the company expects to incur substantial additional costs  including costs related to increased sales and marketing activities  increased research and development  expenditures in connection with seeking regulatory approvals and conducting additional marketing related clinical evaluations  capital equipment and other costs associated with expansion of the company s manufacturing capabilities 
the company believes that its current cash balances and short term investments along with cash generated from the future sales of products will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital requirements through calendar the company may seek additional equity or debt financing to address its working capital needs or to provide funding for capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if sought  will be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
factors affecting future results the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of specifically the company wishes to alert readers that  except for the historical information contained in this annual report on form k  the matters discussed herein are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected

the factors listed below under factors affecting future results  as well as other factors  have in the past affected  and could in the future affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements contained in the following discussion 
limited operating history  anticipated future losses 
the company was organized in april and began commercially shipping its first spacemaker products in september accordingly  the company has only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company and its prospects can be based 
as of june   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company s net operating losses for the fiscal years ending june   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects to continue to incur operating losses on a quarterly and annual basis through at least march  due to the company s limited operating history and the recent transition to ees as its major distributor  there can be no assurance of sales growth or profitability in the future 
the company intends to increase its investments in research and development  sales and marketing  marketing related clinical evaluations and related infrastructure 
due to the anticipated increases in the company s operating expenses  the company s operating results will be adversely affected if sales do not increase 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
to address these risks  the company must respond to competitive developments  continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified persons and successfully commercialize products incorporating advanced technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business company strategy 
dependence upon balloon dissection products  risk of technological obsolescence 
all of the company s sales since inception have been derived from sales of its balloon dissection products  with a substantial portion derived from sales for hernia repair procedures 
failure of the company to develop successfully and commercialize balloon dissection products for applications other than hernia repair could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the success of the company s products depends on the market acceptance of and demand for the company s products and related procedures  the nature of the technological advances inherent in the product designs  reduction in patient trauma or other benefits provided by such products  results of marketing related clinical evaluations  continued adoption of minimally invasive surgery mis procedures by surgeons  reimbursement for the company s products by health care payors and the company s receipt of regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will have the required technical characteristics  that the company s products will provide adequate patient benefits  that marketing related clinical evaluations results will be favorable  that surgeons will continue to adopt mis procedures  that recently introduced products or future products of the company or related procedures will gain market acceptance  or that required regulatory approvals will be obtained 
the failure to achieve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent demand for the company s balloon dissection systems for hernia repair declines and the company s newly introduced products are not commercially accepted or its existing products are not developed for new procedures  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business applications of balloon dissection technology  and additional products under development 
dependence on key distributors 
in december  the company entered into a five year oem supply agreement the expanded ees agreement with ees  pursuant to which gsi granted ees worldwide sales and marketing rights to sell the spacemaker tm balloon dissection systems in the laparoscopic hernia repair and urinary stress incontinence usi markets 
the expanded ees agreement supersedes the june licensing agreement between the company and ees 
ees made guaranteed payments of million  million  and million in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively  under the expanded ees agreement 
ees is not obligated to make any further guaranteed payments under the agreement 
there can be no assurance that ees s manufacturing  marketing or distribution efforts will be successful 
ees s failure to achieve certain levels of sales growth or product orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company intends to establish additional distributorships in the united states for products in areas other than hernia repair and urinary stress incontinence  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
failure to add additional distributors to its distribution network in the united states could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s products are currently sold internationally to general surgeons and specialists through ees and independent distributors in europe  asia  latin america and the middle east 
in june  gsi entered into an exclusive agreement with japan lifeline to market and distribute in japan gsi s balloon dissection systems for use in vascular procedures 
japan lifeline is expected to begin distribution of the gsi balloon dissection systems following receipt of the japanese ministry of health and welfare approval  which the company expects will occur in late or early to date  substantially all of the company s international sales for hernia repair procedures have been made through autosuture  a ussc affiliate  under the same terms and conditions as the company s agreement with ussc  which was terminated in november thus  the company does not anticipate that it will have future sales through autosuture 
although ees has taken over as the company s international distributor  there can be no assurance that ees s efforts in international distribution will be successful 
limited marketing and direct sales experience 
the company has only limited experience marketing and selling its products through its direct sales force  and has sold its products in commercial quantities through its direct sales force to the hernia market and  to a lesser degree  to the vascular and cosmetic and reconstructive surgery market 
establishing marketing and sales capability sufficient to support sales in commercial quantities for the cardiovascular market targeted by the company will require significant resources  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain additional qualified marketing or sales personnel  or that future sales efforts of the company will be successful 
in markets other than cardiovascular  the company intends to establish partnership relationships with additional distribution partners  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in establishing such partnership relationships on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure to establish and maintain an effective distribution channel for the company s products  or establish and retain qualified and effective sales personnel to support commercial sales of the company s products  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and business marketing  sales and distribution 
uncertainty of market acceptance  no assurance of clinical advantage 
the company s success is substantially dependent upon the success of its spacemaker tm balloon dissection products 
the company believes that market acceptance of the company s products will depend on the company s ability to provide evidence to the medical community of the safety  efficacy  clinical advantage and cost effectiveness of its products and the procedures in which these products are intended to be used 
market acceptance is also dependent on the adoption of laparoscopic techniques generally and the conversion of non balloon dissection techniques to balloon dissection techniques specifically 
to date  the company s products have only been used to treat a limited number of patients and the company has limited long term outcomes data 
if the company is not able to demonstrate consistent clinical benefits resulting from the use of its products including reduced procedure time  reduced patient trauma and lower costs  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company further believes that the ability of health care providers to obtain adequate reimbursement for procedures using the company s spacemaker balloon dissector products and related instruments will be critical to market acceptance of the company s products 
although the company believes that procedures using its balloon dissection products currently may be reimbursed in the united states under certain existing procedure codes  there can be no assurance that such procedure codes will remain available or that reimbursement under these codes will be adequate 
the company has limited experience in obtaining third party reimbursement  and the failure to obtain reimbursement for some or all of its products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business third party reimbursement 
the company introduced its balloon dissectors in late and to date there has been relatively little education among surgeons about the benefits of balloon dissection technology 
furthermore  because of the novelty of balloon dissection procedures  many surgeons and surgeons assistants have not developed the requisite skills to perform balloon dissection procedures 
to the extent that laparoscopic techniques are adopted slowly  that balloon dissectors are incorporated into laparoscopic techniques less often or that surgeons are unwilling or unable to develop the skills necessary to utilize balloon dissectors  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see business marketing  sales and distribution 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
results of the company s operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend on numerous factors  including i new product introductions by the company and its competitors and fluctuations in revenues among different product lines and markets  ii purchases of the company s products by ees  iii the rate of adoption by surgeons of balloon dissection technology in markets targeted by the company  iv the sales efforts of the company s distributors  v the mix of sales among distributors and the company s direct sales force  vi timing of patent and regulatory approvals  if any  vii timing and growth of operating expenditures  viii timing of research and development expenses  including marketing related clinical evaluation expenditures  ix intellectual property litigation and x general market conditions 
in the past  the company s sales were highly dependent upon the marketing efforts and success of united states surgical corporation  which was the company s major distributor until the relationship was mutually terminated in november in december  the company entered into the expanded ethicon agreement  pursuant to which gsi granted ees worldwide sales and marketing rights to sell the spacemaker tm balloon dissection systems in the laparoscopic hernia repair and urinary stress incontinence markets 
the company s sales in any period will be highly dependent upon the marketing efforts and success of ees  which are not within the control of the company 
ees made approximately million in guaranteed payments to the company in fiscal year  which constituted of revenues for fiscal year ees is not obligated to make any such guaranteed payments in future quarters 
the company anticipates that sales to ees will fluctuate in the future 
failure by ees to achieve certain levels of sales growth or purchases could adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  announcements or expected announcements by the company  its competitors or its distributor of new products  new technologies or pricing changes could cause existing or potential customers of the company to defer purchases of the company s existing products and could alter the mix of products sold by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that future products or product enhancements will be successfully introduced or that such introductions will not adversely affect the demand for existing products 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past  and the company expects that such results may fluctuate in the future 
due to such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  quarter to quarter comparisons of the company s operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of likely future performance or annual operating results 
in addition  the company s limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible to make 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will achieve sales growth or become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis  if at all  or that its growth  if any  will be consistent with predictions by securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on patents and proprietary technology 
the company s success will depend on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products and processes  to preserve its trade secrets and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing upon the patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
in may  the guidant corporation unit of origin medsystems  inc origin filed an action against gsi in the us district court for the northern district of california  alleging patent infringement of its patent entitled apparatus and method for peritoneal retraction 
gsi subsequently filed an action against origin in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging patent infringement of its patent for a method of tissue plane dissection using balloon systems 
in addition  on september   the company filed another action against origin alleging patent infringement of its patent for a method of serial inflation of tissue dissectors 
a decision against the company in any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
one of the patent applications filed by the company  which is directed to a surgical method using balloon dissection technology  has been placed in interference with a patent application filed by origin medsystems  inc origin  a competitor of the company 
the company believes that the inventor named in its patent application was the first to invent this subject matter  and has asserted that the origin patent application was filed after a disclosure made by such inventor to employees of origin 
origin takes a contrary position 
this interference is presently pending in the united states patent and trademark office uspto and  as permitted by the rules of the uspto  has been referred to an arbitrator for completion of the interference proceeding 
a decision is not expected in this interference proceeding until failure of the company to prevail in such interference proceeding would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
patent interference or infringement involves complex legal and factual issues and is highly uncertain  and there can be no assurance that any conclusion reached by the company regarding patent interference or infringement will be consistent with the resolution of such issue by a court 
in the event the company s products are found to infringe patents held by competitors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to modify successfully its products to avoid infringement  or that any modified products will be commercially successful 
failure in such event to either develop a commercially successful alternative or obtain a license to such patent on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed above  the company is defending itself  and may in the future have to defend itself  in court against allegations of infringement of third party patents 
patent litigation is expensive  requires extensive management time  and could subject the company to significant liabilities  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require the company to cease selling its products 
the validity and breadth of claims in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  may be highly uncertain 
no assurance can be given that any patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to the company  that any of the company s patents or patents to which it has licensed rights will be held valid under current challenges or if subsequently challenged or that persons or entities in addition to origin will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held or licensed by the company or that the company s existing patents will cover the company s future products 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others have not developed or will not develop similar products  duplicate any of the company s products or design around any patents issued to or licensed by the company or that may be issued in the future to the company 
since patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  the company also cannot be certain that others did not first file applications for inventions covered by the company s pending patent applications  nor can the company be certain that it will not infringe any patents that may issue to others on such applications 
legislation has recently been enacted in congress  the effect of which is to immunize physicians and their employers from liability for patent infringement for alleged infringement of patent claims directed to medical procedures 
the patent laws of european and certain other foreign countries generally do not allow for the issuance of patents for methods of surgery on the human body 
accordingly  the ability of the company to gain patent protection for its methods of tissue dissection will be significantly limited 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop a patent portfolio in europe or that the scope of any patent protection will provide competitive advantages to the company 
see business patents and proprietary rights 
royalty payment obligations 
the company has acquired rights to patents from third parties  including rights that apply to the company s current balloon dissection systems 
the company has historically paid and is obligated to pay in the future to such third parties royalties equal to of sales of such products  which payments are expected to exceed minimum royalty payments due under agreements with such parties 
the company also has acquired patent rights under royalty bearing agreements with respect to certain surgical instruments  including the knotmaker product and the balloon valve trocar 
the payment of such royalty amounts will have an adverse impact on the company s gross profit and other results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to satisfy such royalty payment obligations in the future  and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
early stage of development and commercialization  no assurance of ability to manage growth 
the company began commercial sales of its balloon dissection products in september and  as a result  has limited experience in manufacturing  marketing and selling its products commercially 
in january the company entered into a real estate lease and has relocated its headquarters and manufacturing operations in april to this new facility 
in addition  the company has experienced rapid growth in the number of its employees  the number of products under development  the number and amount of products manufactured  and the geographic scope of its sales 
in order to augment its long term competitive position  the company anticipates that it will be required to make significant additional expenditures in research and development and sales and marketing 
the company s inability to manage its growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition  uncertainty of technological change 
competition in the market for medical devices used in tissue dissection surgical procedures is intense and is expected to increase 
the company competes primarily with other producers of mis tissue dissection instruments 
origin  a subsidiary of guidant corporation  and others currently compete against the company in the development  production and marketing of mis tissue dissection instruments and tissue dissection technology 
to the extent that surgeons elect to use open surgical procedures rather than mis  the company also competes with producers of tissue dissection instruments used in open surgical procedures  such as blunt dissectors or graspers 
a number of companies currently compete against the company in the development  production and marketing of tissue dissection instruments and technology for open surgical procedures 
in addition  the company indirectly competes with producers of therapeutic drugs  when such drugs are used as an alternative to surgery 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater capital resources  name recognition  expertise in research and development  manufacturing and marketing and obtaining regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing balloon dissectors or competing technologies that are more effective than products marketed by the company or that render the company s technology obsolete 
additionally  even if the company s products provide performance comparable to competing products or procedures  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or compete against competitors in terms of price  manufacturing  marketing and sales 
many of the alternative treatments for medical indications that can be treated by balloon dissection products and laparoscopic surgery are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
in addition  technological advances with other therapies could make such other therapies more effective or cost effective than balloon dissectors and minimally invasive surgery  and could render the company s technology non competitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that surgeons will use mis to replace or supplement established treatments or that mis will remain competitive with current or future treatments 
the failure of surgeons to adopt mis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the company s development of its balloon dissection systems  the company has also developed surgical instruments for use in mis 
there can be no assurance that the company s surgical instruments will successfully compete with those manufactured by other producers of such surgical instruments 
the failure to achieve commercial market acceptance of such surgical instruments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business competition 
uncertain availability of third party reimbursement 
the company s success will depend upon the ability of surgeons to obtain satisfactory reimbursement from healthcare payors for the company s products 
in the united states  hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third party payors  such as private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the treatment of patients 
reimbursement in the united states for the company s balloon dissection products is currently available from most third party payors  including most major private health care insurance plans and medicaid  under existing surgical procedure codes 
the company does not expect that third party reimbursement in the united states will be available for use of its other products unless and until clearance or approval is received from the federal food and drug administration the fda 
if fda clearance or approval is received  third party reimbursement for these products will depend upon decisions by individual health maintenance organizations  private insurers and other payors 
many payors  including the federal medicare program  pay a preset amount for the surgical facility component of a surgical procedure 
this amount typically includes medical devices such as the company s 
thus  the surgical facility or surgeon may not recover the added cost of the company s products 
in addition  managed care payors often limit coverage to surgical devices on a preapproved list or obtained from an exclusive source 
if the company s products are not on the list or are not available from the exclusive source  the facility or surgeon will need to obtain an exception from the payor or the patient will be required to pay for some or all of the cost of the company s product 
the company believes that procedures using its balloon dissection products currently may be reimbursed in the united states under certain existing procedure codes 
however  there can be no assurance that such procedure codes will remain available or that the reimbursement under these codes will be adequate 
given the efforts to control and decrease health care costs in recent years  there can be no assurance that any reimbursement will be sufficient to permit the company to increase revenues or achieve or maintain profitability 
the unavailability of third party or other adequate reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
many international markets have government managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets  there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
large scale market acceptance of the company s balloon dissection systems and other products will depend on the availability and level of reimbursement in international markets targeted by the company 
currently  the company has been informed by its international distributors that the balloon dissectors have been approved for reimbursement in many of the countries in which the company markets its products 
obtaining reimbursement approvals can require to months or longer 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain reimbursement in any country within a particular time  for a particular amount  or at all 
failure to obtain such approvals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
regardless of the type of reimbursement system  the company believes that surgeon advocacy of its products will be required to obtain reimbursement 
availability of reimbursement will depend on the clinical efficacy of the procedure and the utility and cost of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that surgeons will support and advocate reimbursement for use of the company s systems for all applications intended by the company 
failure by surgeons  hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from health care payors or adverse changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

government regulation 
the company s spacemaker balloon dissection systems and other products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and  to varying degrees  by state and foreign regulatory agencies 
under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  packaging  marketing  distribution and record keeping for medical devices  in order to ensure that medical devices distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use 
prior to commercialization  a medical device generally must receive fda and foreign regulatory clearance or approval  which can be an expensive  lengthy and uncertain process 
the company is also subject to routine inspection by the fda and state agencies  such as the california department of health services cdhs  for compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements  medical device reporting requirements and other applicable regulations 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters  import detentions  fines  civil penalties  injunctions  suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals  recall or seizure of products  operating restrictions  refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow the company to enter into supply contracts  and criminal prosecution 
delays in receipt of  or failure to obtain  regulatory clearances and approvals  if obtained  or any failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain circumstances  by the federal trade commission 
current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
the spacemaker i platform  spacemaker ii platform  spacemaker plastics platform  spacemaker saphtrak platform and knotmaker product each have received k clearance for use during general  endoscopic  laparoscopic or cosmetic and reconstructive surgery  either when tissue dissection is required or  with respect to the knotmaker product  when a surgical knot for suturing is required 
the company has promoted these products for surgical applications eg  hernia repair  subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery and breast augmentation and reconstruction  and may in the future promote these products for the dissection or knotmaking required for additional selected applications eg  treatment of stress urinary incontinence  saphenous vein harvesting and a variety of orthopedic procedures such as anterior spinal fusion 
for any medical device cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require a new k submission 
the company has made modifications to its products which the company believes do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or constitute a major change to the intended use and therefore do not require the submission of new k notices 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda will agree with any of the company s determinations not to submit a new k notice for any of these changes or will not require the company to submit a new k notice for any of the changes made to the product 
if such additional k clearances are required  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain them on a timely basis  if at all  and delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k notice for any product modification  the company may be prohibited from marketing the modified product until the k notice is cleared by the fda 
sales of medical devices outside of the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the company currently relies on its international distributors for the receipt of premarket approvals and compliance with clinical trial requirements in those countries that require them  and it expects to continue to rely on distributors in those countries where the company continues to use distributors 
in the event that the company s international distributors fail to obtain or maintain premarket approvals or compliance in foreign countries where such approvals or compliance are required  the company may be required to cause the applicable distributor to file revised governmental notifications  cease commercial sales of its products in the applicable countries or otherwise act so as to stop any ongoing noncompliance in such countries 
any enforcement action by regulatory authorities with respect to past or any future regulatory noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to continue selling its products within the european economic area following june   the company will be required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the medical devices directive and to affix ce marking on its products to attest to such compliance 
the company is currently in the process of seeking ce marking for the products it intends to market internationally and expects to receive this marking in the second quarter of fiscal ending december  
failure by the company to comply with ce marking requirements by june would mean that the company would be unable to sell its products in the european economic area unless and until compliance was achieved  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

limited manufacturing experience 
the company has only limited experience in manufacturing its products in commercial quantities 
the company intends to scale up its production of new products and to increase its manufacturing capacity for existing and new products 
however  manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
difficulties experienced by the company in manufacturing scale up and manufacturing difficulties including  in the event of low demand  overcapacity could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in scaling up or that it will not experience manufacturing difficulties or product recalls in the future 
in january  the company entered into a new facility lease in cupertino  california  and relocated its headquarters and manufacturing operations to this new location in april the new facilities lease comprises approximately  square feet  and the monthly rent is approximately  dependence on single source suppliers  lack of contractual arrangements 
the company currently relies upon single source suppliers for several components of its balloon dissection products  and in most cases there are no formal supply contracts 
there can be no assurance that the component materials obtained from single source suppliers will continue to be available in adequate quantities or  if required  that the company will be able to locate alternative sources of such component materials on a timely basis to market its products  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the single source suppliers will meet the company s future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
the failure to obtain sufficient quantities and qualities of such component materials  or the loss of any of the company s single source suppliers  could cause a delay in gsi s ability to fulfill orders while it attempts to identify and certify a replacement supplier  if any  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

product liability risk and product recall  limited insurance coverage 
the company s business exposes it to potential product liability risks or product recalls that are inherent in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices  in the event the use of the company s products cause or are alleged to have caused adverse effects on a patient or such products are believed to be defective 
the company s products are designed to be used in certain procedures where there is a high risk of serious injury or death 
such risks will exist even with respect to those products that have received  or may in the future receive  regulatory clearance for commercial sale 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company s product liability insurance is adequate or that such insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
particularly given the lack of data regarding the long term results of the use of balloon dissection products  there can be no assurance the company will avoid significant product liability claims 
consequently  a product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

risks associated with international sales 
sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately 
and of the company s sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will represent an increasing portion of revenue in the future 
the company intends to continue to expand its sales outside of the united states and to enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources and subject the company further to the risks of selling internationally 
these risks include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
in addition  because all of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance that regulatory  currency and other factors will not adversely impact the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices

dependence on management and other key personnel 
the company is dependent upon a limited number of key management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of such key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  the company s success will be dependent upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified sales  management  manufacturing and research and development personnel 
the company faces intense competition in its recruiting activities and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and or retain qualified personnel 
potential volatility of stock price 
the market prices of the company s common stock and the stock of many other publicly held medical device companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile 
announcements regarding competitive developments  product sales  clinical marketing trial results  release of reports by securities analysts  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  regulatory developments  changes in regulatory or medical reimbursement policies  economic and other external factors  as well as period to period fluctuations in the company s financial results  may have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock
