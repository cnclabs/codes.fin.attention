item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows during the three year period ended september  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the five year summary of selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ending september  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income interest  net income loss before provision benefit for taxes provision benefit for taxes net income loss acquisition of business on february  the company acquired certain assets of awa microelectronics pty 
ltd 
awam  a subsidiary of awa limited  based in sydney  australia 
the awam assets that were acquired by a new subsidiary of the company  quality semiconductor australia  pty 
ltd 
qsa  included a fully operational wafer foundry business and product design center 
in a separate agreement  the company has also signed a strategic alliance agreement with awa limited  to jointly develop new products and technologies 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
the net purchase price of the awam facility was million  consisting of million cash  million present value of redeemable preference shares of qsa  fair value of warrants of  and acquisition costs of approximately  the allocation of the purchase price  based upon an independent valuation  consisted of million of net tangible assets and million of intangible assets which were related to assembled workforce  customer base  and goodwill  which are being amortized over five years 
the company had incurred approximately  of amortization expense in fiscal  in fiscal related to the acquisition 
awa limited was issued  redeemable preference shares of qsa at an issue price of  per share which may be put by awa limited back to qsa pursuant to the terms of a put option deed dated january  in july  the company redeemed preference shares for approximately million dollars 
the company will redeem the final preference shares for approximately million including interest charges in january these redeemable preference shares have been categorized as debt on the balance sheet and discounted to their present value 
qsa s results of operations have been included in the consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net revenues net revenues in fiscal were million  increasing by over net revenues in fiscal this compares with a decrease of net revenues of in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net revenues during fiscal was mainly due to shipments of proprietary networking and clock management products which began shipping in fiscal and accounted for over of fiscal revenues  and increased unit shipments in logic products  partially offset by lower average selling prices 
the decrease in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal was mainly due to a substantial decline in the overall average selling prices partially offset by sales from qsa 
the company expects that the average selling prices of its products generally will continue to decline over the lives of such products 
sales of networking  clock management and interface logic devices are expected to continue to account for a significant majority of revenues in the foreseeable future 
to increase net revenues  the company seeks to increase unit sales of existing products  principally by reducing prices in conjunction with cost reduction programs  and to introduce and sell new products 
no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  the company sells a significant portion of its products through distributors 
domestic distributors accounted for approximately   and of the company s net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in percentage of net revenues through distribution in fiscal was mainly due to a majority of the networking products being shipped direct from qsi 
sales by arrow electronics inc accounted for approximately   and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively  and the remainder of domestic distributor sales were made primarily through bell microproducts inc bell and nu horizons electronics corp 
recognition of sales to these distributors and the related cost of sales is deferred until such distributors resell the products to their customers 
there can be no assurance that future sales by distributors will continue at the present levels 
the loss of one or more distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
export sales  primarily consisting of sales to countries in europe and the far east  constituted  and of net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margin the following table sets forth the company s net revenues and gross margin years ended september  in thousands  except percentage data net revenues    cost of revenues    gross margin    gross margin as a percentage of net revenues the company s cost of revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly performed by third party vendors  testing by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the testing  procurement  scheduling  quality assurance functions performed by the company  and writedowns of inventory 
gross margin in fiscal was of net revenues  compared with of net revenues in fiscal  and of net revenues in the increase from fiscal to in gross margin resulted from changes in product mix  specifically  the sale of higher margin networking and clock management products and the company s cost reduction programs 
gross margin in fiscal includes a million inventory adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter  mainly due to a decision by management to exit the fifo product line 
prior to the inventory writedown  gross margin was for fiscal the decline from fiscal to in gross margin resulted principally from the recording of million in inventory write downs resulting from changes in the product mix and reduced oem demand 
additionally  gross margin was impacted by lower average selling prices  changes in product mix  lower oem demand and absorption of fixed costs at qsa 
this margin erosion was offset in part by the company s cost reduction programs 
the company is likely to face potential inventory risks and writedowns 
the company purchases some of its wafers in yen denominated transactions and is subject to exchange rate risk 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to this risk by entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge its yen denominated firm purchase commitments 
the markets for the company s products are subject to severe price competition and price declines 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in reducing its product costs rapidly enough to maintain or increase its gross margin level 
due to price declines  mainly in the networking product line  gross margin as a percent of net revenues will decrease in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  prior to the inventory write off  and the company will incur a loss for the quarter 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  including but not limited to  economic conditions and overall market demand in the united states and worldwide  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  changes in product mix  fluctuations in manufacturing costs which affect the company s gross margins  declines in market demand for the company s and its customers products  sales timing  the level of orders which are received and can be shipped in a quarter  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  product obsolescence  price erosion  and competitive factors 
the company s operating results in fiscal are likely to be affected by these factors as well as others 
the company must order wafers and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because many of the company s customers place orders with short lead times 
in the third quarter of fiscal  these factors caused the company to have a million inventory writedown 
these factors increase not only the inventory risk but also the difficulty of forecasting quarterly operating results 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  the company frequently ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  and shipments in the third month are higher at the end of that month 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter contributes to the difficulty in predicting the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations 
the company s products are in various stages of their product life cycles 
the company s success is highly dependent upon its ability to develop complex new products  to introduce them to the marketplace ahead of the competition  and to have them selected for design into products of leading system manufacturers 
these factors have become increasingly important to the company s results of operations because the rate of change in the markets served by the company continues to accelerate 
since product life cycles are continually becoming shorter  revenues may be affected quickly if new product introductions are delayed or if the company s products are not designed into successive generations of products of the company s customers 
the company s gross margins also will depend on the company s success at introducing and ramping production of new products quickly and effectively because the gross margins of semiconductor products decline as competitive products are introduced 
also  the company must deliver product to customers according to customer schedules 
delays in new product introductions could affect revenues and gross margins for current and follow on products if customers shift to competitors to meet their requirements 
as a result of the above factors  gross margin fluctuations are difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that the company will maintain gross margins at current levels in future periods 
to offset this margin pressure  the company seeks to reduce costs by improving wafer yields  negotiating price restrictions with suppliers  and achieving economies of scale by means of higher production levels 
the company also seeks to offset margin erosion by selling a higher percentage of new products  which tend to have higher margins than more mature products 
no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
research and development the company s research and development activities include process development and new product development 
research and development expenditures in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared with million  or of net revenues in fiscal  and million  or of net revenues in fiscal the increase in spending for fiscal was mainly due to increased spending on new product development and process technology 
these costs included higher material and testing charges  and increased payroll related expenses 
this increase in fiscal was mainly the result of costs associated with the development of new products and processes and the added costs of the development group located at qsa beginning in february the company believes that the continued development of its process technology and new products is essential to its success and is committed to continue its investment in research and development to maintain a strong technological position in the industry 
all the company s research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the company currently expects to incur higher research and development expenses in fiscal the company believes that future revenue growth will depend in substantial part on the success of new products and the continued success and sales of existing products 
new products are generally incorporated into a customer s product or system at the design stage 
however  design wins  which can often require significant expenditures by the company  may precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
no assurance can be given that the company will achieve design wins or that any design win will result in significant future net revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenditures in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared with million  or of net revenues in fiscal  and million  or of net revenues in fiscal sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased mainly due to increased sales commissions due to higher revenues  increased payroll related expenses and marketing programs to support the launch of new products 
sales and marketing expenditures in fiscal increased slightly from fiscal due to increases in advertising and promotional expenses  payroll related expenses and travel  partially offset by lower sales commissions 
the company expects to incur higher sales and marketing expenses in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenditures in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared with million  or of net revenues in fiscal  and million  or of net revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenditures in fiscal remained flat compared to fiscal the percentage decrease reflects management s continued efforts to control spending 
general and administrative expenditures in fiscal increased mainly due to the added costs of the australian subsidiary  and legal costs related to patent prosecution and defense 
the company expects to incur higher general and administrative expenses in fiscal other income other income of million in fiscal was earned as a result of engineering and marketing services provided by the company pursuant to an agreement with awa limited 
the company has completed the services under the agreement with awa limited and does expect this other income to continue in future periods 
interest  net net interest expense for fiscal was  compared to net interest income of  in fiscal the decrease in net interest income was due to increased interest expense associated with an increase in notes payable used to purchase property and equipment 
net interest income in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was mainly due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments used for the purchase of awam assets in february and increased interest expense associated with notes payable for the purchase of capital equipment and interest expense incurred with the redeemable preference shares issued to awam 
provision benefit for taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
significant items impacting the effective tax rate include state income taxes  research and development credits and nondeductible amortization of interest 
the company recorded a tax benefit for fiscal based on available carryback potential 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal was due primarily to the recognition of deferred tax assets previously subject to valuation allowances during fiscal financial condition  liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations and investment in property  plant and equipment primarily through the sale of equity securities  debt issuance and technology development and license fees 
total assets increased million to a total of million at year end 
cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased million  accounts receivable increased million  property and equipment  net  increased million  and goodwill and other assets decreased  current liabilities decreased  long term obligations to a related party increased to million  and shareholders equity increased million 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to cash raised in two private placements of common stock totaling million during fiscal  offset by payments totaling million made to awam under the purchase agreement and payments made for notes payable 
additionally   was used in operating activities and million was used for the purchase of wafer fabrication equipment at qsa and other capital equipment purchased during fiscal capital expenditures were million in fiscal see note and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable increased at september  mainly due to a higher net revenues generated in fiscal accounts payable increased by million during fiscal because of increases in operating activities to support the growth in net revenues 
in november  the company negotiated a private placement of unsecured  convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of million  of qsa 
the company received million of the total financing in december  and converted the notes issued for such amount into  shares of the company s common stock 
the company decided not to sell  and one of the investors agreed not to buy million of the notes 
in may  the company completed a private placement of  units  each consisting of ten shares of the company s common stock and a one year warrant to purchase one additional share of the company s common stock for 
the units were priced at per unit for a total of million in cash 
the company has used a certain amount of the proceeds for payment on the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of awam  general corporate purposes and working capital 
the company believes that current available cash  short term investments  cash generated from operations  and credit arrangements will be sufficient to finance the company s anticipated operations and capital equipment requirements through at least the next twelve months 
the company does expect to be out of compliance with certain loan covenants at its million unsecured line of credit in the first quarter of fiscal however  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that adequate capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
employees the number of company employees grew during fiscal mainly due to the growth of the business 
the company had employees at the end of fiscal as compared to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
impact on currency and inflation the company makes yen denominated purchases of wafers from japanese suppliers 
in fiscal year this resulted in material unfavorable foreign exchange transactions included in cost of product revenues 
periodically  the company enters into forward exchange contracts primarily to hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on purchases denominated in yen 
the maturities of forward exchange contracts are short term in nature 
notwithstanding these precautions however  the company remains subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange movements between the dates of when foreign currency purchase transactions are recorded and the dates cash payments are made in foreign currencies 
inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
factors that may affect future results cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements this report contains certain forward loking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
for such statements the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in section e of and rule b under the securities exchange act of such forwrd looking statements include  without limitations  statements regarding the company s expectations  intentions or future strategies and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
the following factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in the report  could cause the results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligations to update any such forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth below and in the documents incorporated by reference herein 
in evaluating the company s business  propspective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information set forth herein or incorporated herein by reference 
potential declines in operating results the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability  including  among others  factors pertaining to i competition  such as competitive pressures on average selling prices of the company s products and the introduction of new products by competitors  ii the current and anticipated future dependence on the company s existing product lines  iii new product development  such as increased research  development and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis and the amount and timing of recognition of non recurring development revenue  iv manufacturing and operations  such as fluctuations in manufacturing yields  inventory management  raw materials  and production and assembly capacity  v the company operates a wafer fabrication facility which involves significant risks typically inherent in any manufacturing endeavor  as well as additional risks associated with production yields  technical difficulties with process control  expenses associated with responding to increases in environmental pollution regulation or disposal of environmentally hazardous waste and events limiting production  such as fires or other damage  and the inability to keep production at a high level  vi expenses that may be incurred in obtaining  enforcing and defending claims with respect to intellectual property rights  vii sales and marketing  such as loss of significant distributor  concentration of customers  and volume discounts that may be granted to significant customers  viii customer demand  such as market acceptance of products  the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and general economic conditions in the semiconductor and electronic systems industries  as well as other factors  such as risks associated with doing business abroad  retention of key personnel and management of growth and volatility in the company s revenues and stock price 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by price erosion  declining gross margins  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and heightened international competition in many markets 
the company s competitors include large semiconductor companies that have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company  as well as emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets such as those addressed by the company 
as a result  average selling prices asps in the semiconductor industry generally  and for the company s products in particular  have decreased significantly over the life of each product 
the company expects that asps for its existing products will continue to decline over time and that asps for each new product will decline significantly over the life of the product 
declines inasps in the company s products  if not offset by reductions in the cost of producing those products or by sales of new products with higher gross margins  would decrease the company s overall gross margins  could cause a negative adjustment to the valuation of the company s inventories and could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
dependence on qsfct and quickswitch product lines a substantial majority of the company s net revenues are derived from sales of interface logic devices and  in particular  products in the company s qsfct and quickswitch logic family 
the company anticipates that sales of these products will continue to comprise a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the demand for such products may be sharply reduced by competition and by microprocessors or other system devices that increasingly include interface logic 
because of the company s dependence on sales of these products  declines in gross margins for these products resulting from declines in asps or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
dependence on networking product line during fiscal  the company commenced shipping its advanced cmos fast ethernet transceiver chips that provide high integration solutions for the adapter  repeater  switch and card bus markets  and atm mux demux for the atm multiplexer and switch markets 
these products are in the early stages of production and test results may vary more than for products in later stages of production 
there can be no assurance that production yields will meet management projections or that the performance of these products will meet actual specifications 
additionally  demand for such products may not meet the company s expectations 
in addition the demand for such products may decline as competition and availability increase  and more advanced products are introduced 
the company commenced shipping these units to its customers with their approval prior to the completion of qualification during fiscal management has made estimates on future returns of these products and provided necessary reserves 
however  these estimates could change and the actual return rate could be higher 
should the company not complete the qualification process on a timely basis or if the performance of these products do not meet specifications  there is no assurance that the customer will not cancel existing orders or if the performance of these products does meet actual specifications 
in addition  functionality and demand for such products may not meet the company s or customers expectations  and the demand and pricing for such products will decline as competition and availability increase  and more advanced products are introduced 
during the early stage of new product introductions  the parts are generally marked as engineering samples and shipped to potential customers for evaluation 
based on successful evaluation by the customer  products are shipped in volume to customers prior to the successful completion of qualification 
upon successful completion of qualification the engineering samples markings are removed from the product 
there is no assurance that upon completion of successful qualification  current and future customers will accept product marked as engineering samples 
if the company is unable to sell through all such marked parts  there is no guarantee that the company will not need to writedown all such inventory on hand or in production to zero or minimal value 
dependence on new products the company s future success is highly dependent upon the timely completion and introduction of new products at competitive price performance levels 
the failure of the company to timely complete and introduce new products at competitive price performance levels could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
new products are generally incorporated into a customer s product or system at the design stage 
however  design wins  which can often require significant expenditures by the company  may precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
no assurance can be given that the company will achieve design wins or that any design win will result in significant future revenues 
risks associated with operating australian fabrication facility in february  the company purchased a fully functional wafer fabrication facility and product design center located in australia 
the company receives a significant amount of its wafer requirements for its logic and memory products from this facility 
any disruption of the company s wafer fab facility or the company s inability to keep the production of wafers at a high level due to technical factors or lack of customer demand could have a materially adverse impact on the company s operations 
the process technology for the fabrication of the company s wafers at this facility is highly complex and sensitive to dust and other contaminants 
although the fabrication process is highly controlled  the equipment may not perform flawlessly 
minute impurities  difficulties in the production process or defects in the masks can cause a substantial percentage of the wafers to be rejected or individual die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
accordingly  any failure by the company to achieve acceptable product yields could have a material and adverse effect on the company s operations results 
raw materials essential to the company s wafer fabrication business are generally available from multiple sources and thecompany has thus far not experienced production problems or delays due to shortages in materials or components 
there can be no assurance  however  that future shortages will not occur  any such shortages could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
government regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage  use and disposal of chemicals and gases used in semiconductor processing 
although the company strives to conform the activities of its manufacturing facilities to applicable environmental regulations  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur unanticipated future costs based on inadvertent violations of such regulations or on the implementation of more stringent regulations in the future 
dependence on fabrication  assembly and test subcontractors a substantial number of the wafers for the company s semiconductor products are fabricated by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing ltd 
tsmc  and a limited number of wafers are manufactured by seiko instruments inc seiko and ricoh corporation ricoh 
the company s reliance on its suppliers to fabricate its wafers at their production facilities in japan and taiwan involves significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  potential lack of adequate capacity  technical difficulties and events limiting production  such as fires or other damage to production facilities 
the company has from time to time experienced significant delays in receiving fabricated wafers from these suppliers  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience similar or more severe delays from its suppliers in the future 
any inability or unwillingness of the company s fabrication providers to provide adequate quantities of finished wafers to meet the company s needs could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s reliance on third party wafer fabrication suppliers also increases the length of the development cycle for the company s products  which may provide time to market advantages to competitors that have in house fabrication capacity 
the company also depends upon its fabrication suppliers to participate in process improvement efforts  such as the transition to finer geometries  and any inability or unwillingness of such suppliers to do so could adversely affect the company s development and introduction of new products 
competitors having their own wafer fabrication facilities  or access to suppliers having such facilities  using superior process technologies at the same geometries or manufacturing products at smaller geometries  could manufacture and sell competitive  higher performance products at a lower price 
the introduction of such products by competitors could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company relies on overseas subcontractors for the assembly and testing of its finished products 
any significant disruption in adequate supplies from  or degradation in the quality of components or services supplied by  these subcontractors  or any other circumstance that would require the company to quality alternative sources of supply  could delay shipment and result in the loss of customers  limitations or reductions in the company s revenues  and other adverse effects on the company s operating results 
risks of international sales the company purchases a significant amount of its semiconductor wafers and substantially all of its assembly services from foreign suppliers 
as a result  the company s business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad  such as foreign governmental regulations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  political unrest  disruptions or delays and shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which the company s manufacturing and test assembly sources are located 
the company s purchases of wafers from seiko instruments inc are denominated in japanese yen 
although the company has from time to time engaged in hedging activities to mitigate exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by a decline in exchange rate 
patents and proprietary rights the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert claims against the company that result in litigation 
any such litigation could result in significant expense and divert the company s attention from other matters 
if any of the company s products were found to infringe any third party patent  and such patent were determined to be valid  the third party would be entitled to injunctive relief  which would prevent the company from selling any such infringing products 
in addition  the company could suffer significant monetary damages  which could include treble damages for any infringement that is determined to be willful 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success will depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of key employees  who would be difficult to replace  and its ability to attract and retain qualified marketing  technical and management personnel  particularly highly skilled design  process and test engineers  for whom competition is intense 
the loss of or failure to attract and retain any such persons could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
to manage recent and potential future growth effectively  the company will need to continue to implement and improve its operational  financial and management information systems and to hire  train  motivate and manage its employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able effectively to achieve growth or manage any such growth  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
customer concentration a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s net revenue in the past 
loss of one or more of the company s current customers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company has experienced and may continue to experience lower margins on sales to significant customers as a result of volume pricing arrangements 
dependence on manufacturer representatives and distributors the company markets and distributes its products primarily through manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
the company s distributors typically offer competing products 
the distribution channels have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties 
the loss of one or more manufacturers representatives or distributors  or the decision by one or more distributors to reduce the number of the company s products offered by such distributors or to carry the product lines of the company s competitors  could have a material effect on the company s operating results 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in approximately two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
any year compliance problem of either the company  its suppliers  its service providers or its customers could result in a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
manufacturing systems the company currently has separate manufacturing and financial data collection systems 
these systems  which are manufactured by different vendors  are not fully integrated together and require significant amounts of manual reconciliations and reporting 
the company is currently reviewing alternative solutions  reporting and controls in order to minimize the chance of error in the financial statements 
there is no guarantee that the company will be able to develop or implement an acceptable solution or that an error in the current or future financial statements may not occur or not be recognized timely 
any failure to develop or implement an acceptable solution or an error in the current or future financial statements could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
cyclical nature of semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times and has been characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of asps and overcapacity 
in addition  the end markets for systems that incorporate the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
volatility of company s stock price the company s earnings and stock price have been  and may be  subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue  gross margins or earnings from expected levels could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s stock in any given period 
the company may not learn of  or be able to confirm  revenue  gross margin or earnings shortfalls until late in the quarter  or following the end of the quarter  because a significant portion of the company s revenue in a quarter typically is shipped in the last few weeks of that quarter 
in addition  future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  including technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  litigation  or changes in earnings estimates by analysts  may cause the market price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially 
stock prices for many technology companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to operating results  such as general economic  political and market conditions 
the company s stock price is also subject to potentially large volatility due to the very low trading volumes of the company s stock on most days since the initial public offering of the company s stock on november  in addition  this low trading volume may continue and could affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares
