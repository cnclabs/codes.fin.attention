item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation reported net earnings of million or per share on a fully diluted basis for the year ended december   compared to net earnings of million or per share on a fully diluted basis in during  the corporation commenced a restructuring of certain of its operations and recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax 
excluding the effects of the restructuring and of a million and million decrease in income tax expense in and  respectively  as a result of the corporation s reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance  earnings from continuing operations increased from million per share on a fully diluted basis in to million per share on a fully diluted basis in this growth in earnings from continuing operations in was a function of a higher level of sales and operating income  a lower effective tax rate  and lower interest expense 
during  the corporation generated free cash flow cash available for debt reduction prior to the effects of cash proceeds received from sales of businesses  issuances of equity  and sales of receivables of million  compared to free cash flow of million in the increase in free cash flow in was primarily the result of improved working capital management 
the combination of strong operating results and free cash flow coupled with the proceeds received from the sale of discontinued operations in enabled the corporation to reduce its ratio of debt to total capitalization from at december   to at december  continuing operations sales the following chart sets forth an analysis of the consolidated changes in sales for the years ended december    and analysis of changes in sales of continuing operations for the year ended december  dollars in millions total sales    unit volume existing disposed price currency change in total sales in the above chart and throughout the remainder of this discussion  the following definitions apply existing reflects the change in unit volume for businesses where period to period comparability exists 
disposed reflects the change in total sales of continuing operations for businesses that were included in the prior year s results  but subsequently have been sold 
total sales for the year ended december   were billion  which represented a increase over sales of billion 
during  existing unit volume grew over the sales level in the growth in unit volume occurred both in the consumer and home improvement products consumer segment and in the commercial and industrial products commercial segment 
total sales for the year ended december   were billion  which represented a increase over sales of billion  due to growth in both the consumer and commercial segments 
restructuring the corporation actively seeks to identify opportunities to improve its cost structure 
these opportunities may involve the closure of manufacturing facilities or the reorganization of other operations 
the corporation has undertaken restructuring actions in the past which generated improvements in its cost structure 
those improvements  however  are subject to erosion over time as competitive pressures intensify or commodity prices increase 
in order to preserve those improvements  the corporation continuously seeks opportunities to further enhance its cost structure 
based upon a number of factors  including the weak retail environment in europe which had begun to soften in the latter part of  the corporation decided to intensify its cost reduction efforts and recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million million after tax early in the corporation modified portions of the initial restructuring plan later in as a result of changed business conditions and the insight of new management in certain businesses 
the net effect of these modifications was to increase the total restructuring charge recognized in to million million after tax 
the major component of the million restructuring charge relates to the elimination of approximately  positions  of which approximately  are in the consumer segment 
as a result  severance benefits totaling million  principally associated with the european consumer businesses  were accrued in the restructuring charge 
the balance of the restructuring charge primarily represented non cash charges associated with the corporation s decision to rationalize certain manufacturing operations  principally in the consumer businesses in the united states 
such rationalization includes the outsourcing of certain products currently manufactured by the corporation and the closure of several small manufacturing facilities 
the principal non cash charge consisted of a million write down to fair value of certain land and buildings affected by the rationalization 
the remaining restructuring charge primarily related to the write down to fair value of equipment made obsolete or redundant due to the decision to close certain facilities or outsource certain production 
the corporation s restructuring activity during is summarized below reversal of previous reserve and reserve reserve accrual utilization of reserve at dollars in as initially of new dec 
 millions established reserve cash non cash severance benefits write down of land and buildings other charges 

total the corporation anticipates that the remaining restructuring reserve of million as of december   will be substantially spent in as certain severance actions taken in the european consumer businesses are subject to scheduled payouts mandated by local custom or governmental regulations 
the corporation estimates that the implementation of the restructuring plan resulted in savings of approximately million in and  based on current market conditions  will result in savings of approximately million in and million annually thereafter 
the corporation is committed to continuous productivity improvement and  as part of its periodic strategic planning review  continues to evaluate additional opportunities for cost reduction 
as part of this commitment  the corporation has embarked on the specific actions included in the restructuring plan described above 
many of these actions involve the relocation or consolidation of production processes 
realization of the savings identified above depends on the effectiveness and timing of these actions 
earnings operating income from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was for compared to and for and  respectively 
excluding the effects of the million restructuring charge recognized in  operating income from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was for compared to and for and  respectively 
gross margin as a percentage of sales in was compared to for and for the decrease in gross margin in from the prior year s level was primarily attributable to several factors 
first  actions taken by the corporation in to reduce inventories from the high level at the end of resulted in lower production levels during  and the associated lower overhead absorption negatively affected gross margin 
second  competitive pressures did not permit the corporation s businesses to institute certain price increases and  in some cases  caused the businesses to reduce prices from the prior year s level 
gross margin also was negatively affected by manufacturing inefficiencies  including those associated with new manufacturing facilities  and changes in the mix of products sold in gross margin in was slightly higher than in the impact of increased manufacturing productivity and cost reduction initiatives during  however  was substantially offset by rising commodity costs and by reduced gross margin in the european operations 
gross margin in was adversely affected by a softening european retail environment in the fourth quarter of and by residual inefficiencies in european operations associated with the closure of two manufacturing facilities in mid selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were for compared to for and for the improvements in compared to and in compared to were the result of cost reduction initiatives and the leverage effects of higher sales volumes on fixed and semi fixed costs 
net interest expense interest expense less interest income was million in compared to million in and million in net interest expense for was significantly lower than for  primarily due to lower debt levels in those lower debt levels resulted from debt repayments  early in  with the sales proceeds of the discontinued prc segment and from improved operating cash flow during net interest expense for was below the level as a result of reduced borrowing levels during the year  partially offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt 
other expense for   and primarily included costs associated with the sale of receivables program 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during and  the corporation reversed a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance based on its projection of future taxable earnings in the united states  including  for  the impact of the then pending sale of prc inc the effect of this reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was to decrease and income tax expense by million and million  respectively 
excluding the effect of the million income tax benefit associated with the restructuring charge in and the effects of the million and million income tax benefits that resulted from the reductions of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance in and  respectively  the corporation s reported tax rate on continuing operations was in compared to a rate of in and in contributing to the lower tax rate both for compared to and for compared to were higher taxable earnings in the united states and a change in the mix of operating income outside the united states from subsidiaries in higher rate tax jurisdictions to subsidiaries in lower rate tax jurisdictions or subsidiaries that profit from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
an analysis of taxes on earnings is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the corporation fully recognized the benefit of domestic deferred tax assets  exclusive of foreign tax credits  for financial reporting purposes 
the benefit of the previously unrecognized deferred tax assets has lowered the domestic portion of tax expense for the past several years 
the corporation s effective tax rate will be significantly higher in future periods 
business segments the corporation operates in two business segments consumer and home improvement products  including consumer and professional power tools and accessories  household products  security hardware  outdoor products composed of electric lawn and garden tools and recreational products  plumbing products  and product service  and commercial and industrial products  including fastening and assembly systems and glass container forming and inspection equipment 
sales and operating income by business segment for the year ended december  millions of dollars consumer and home improvement products total sales    operating income operating income excluding restructuring costs and goodwill amortization commercial and industrial products total sales operating income operating income excluding restructuring costs and goodwill amortization corporate and eliminations operating income total sales    total operating income total operating income excluding restructuring costs and goodwill amortization consumer and home improvement products the following chart sets forth an analysis of the change in sales for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   by geographic area within the consumer segment 
united total states europe other consumer existing unit volume price currency total consumer total sales in the consumer segment for were higher than in  with existing unit volume up over the level 
sales in the united states increased by over the prior year s level  reflecting an increase in existing unit volume  partially offset by a decline in price 
the price decline from the level was primarily due to price reductions taken in the household products and the power tools and accessories businesses 
a significant component of the price reduction by the household products business related to a substantial price reduction taken in the latter part of on the snakelight r flexible flashlight  with the balance related to price reductions taken on various other product lines  predominantly to reduce levels of excess inventory or in connection with the exit of certain low margin product lines 
the price reduction by the power tools and accessories business was primarily in response to competitive pressures  but also to reduce levels of excess inventories 
unit volume in the united states increased by in over the level principally as a result of strong unit volume growth in the power tools and accessories  security hardware  and plumbing products businesses  partially offset by unit volume declines in the household products business 
the unit volume growth in the domestic power tools and accessories business was primarily the result of continued strong demand for dewalt r professional power tools and accessories as well as the successful expansion of the versapak tm interchangeable battery system to outdoor lawn and garden tools 
the unit volume growth in the domestic security hardware business occurred in virtually all product categories  and the unit volume growth in the plumbing products business occurred in both retail and professional distribution channels 
the unit volume decline in the household products business was in comparison to a strong  which benefited from pent up demand for the snakelight flexible flashlight at the end of while unit sales of the snakelight flexible flashlight during declined from the level and unit volume declines were experienced in other categories due to the exit of certain low margin product lines  those declines were substantially offset by unit volume increases in resulting from refinements to existing products  such as the global line of quick n easy tm irons  and from introductions of new products  including the floorbuster tm cordless room vacuum with full length upright handle and the scumbuster tm cordless submersible tub and tile scrubber 
excluding the negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  sales in the consumer businesses in europe decreased by in from the level 
the decline in sales in in the european consumer businesses was primarily the result of price reductions taken in response to competitive pressures and to reduce levels of excess inventories 
unit volume in was essentially equal to the level as increased sales of power tools  spurred by the success of the dewalt and elu r professional product lines  were offset by unit volume declines in security hardware  accessories  outdoor products  and household products 
excluding the negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  some european countries achieved good sales growth in over levels  however  this growth was offset by declines in other countries  most notably germany and the united kingdom 
excluding the negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  sales in the consumer businesses in other geographic regions increased by in over the level due largely to price increases in certain countries  primarily in latin america to keep pace with inflation  partially offset by price reductions in other countries 
the sales growth  exclusive of the negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  was experienced in a number of countries  most notably in latin american countries such as mexico  colombia  and brazil  offset by sales declines in the far east and certain other countries  most notably canada and australia 
operating income as a percentage of sales for the consumer segment was in compared to in excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and the restructuring charge  operating income as a percentage of sales would have been in compared to in operating income as a percentage of sales  excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and the restructuring charge  improved in over the level in the domestic security hardware and plumbing products businesses  however  those improvements were offset by declines in the household products business  the worldwide power tools and accessories business  and the european security hardware operations 
excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and the restructuring charge  operating income as a percentage of sales for the worldwide power tools and accessories business in was below the level as declines experienced in the power tools and accessories businesses in the united states  latin america  canada  australia  and the far east in more than offset an improvement in the power tools and accessories business in europe 
that profitability improvement in the power tools and accessories business in europe  however  was in comparison to an extremely weak  and the european profitability level in did not rebound to the level 
the declines in operating income as a percentage of sales  excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and the restructuring charge  in from levels in the power tools and accessories businesses in the united states  latin america  canada  australia  and the far east primarily resulted from manufacturing inefficiencies  including those associated with new manufacturing facilities and the businesses efforts to reduce inventory levels in  competitive pressures which adversely affected pricing  and higher transportation costs  partially offset by tight controls over selling  general  and administrative expenses 
while sales of other existing products and new product introductions during may mitigate the effect  the corporation believes that comparisons of sales and profitability in to levels will be difficult for the household products business  particularly in the first half of  based upon the significance of snakelight to sales and profitability of the business in  reduced demand  which is no longer expected to exceed capacity  as the product matures  and the price reductions on snakelight taken by the business in the latter part of total sales in the consumer segment for were higher than in  with existing unit volume up over the level 
unit volume in the united states increased by in over the level as a result of strong unit volume growth in the power tools and accessories and household products businesses  partially offset by unit volume declines in the security hardware and plumbing products businesses 
the growth in the domestic power tools and accessories business was the result of continued strong demand for dewalt professional power tools and accessories and the successful expansion in the latter half of of a line of consumer products that use the versapak interchangeable battery system 
during  the household products business achieved a double digit rate of growth in unit volume driven by the continued success of the snakelight flexible flashlight  which was introduced late in the domestic security hardware and plumbing products businesses each experienced modest unit volume declines from levels during excluding the substantial positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  sales in the consumer businesses in europe increased by in over the level despite a weak fourth quarter in this increase was composed of increased sales of power tools and accessories  household products  and security hardware  partially offset by decreased sales of outdoor products 
exclusive of positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates during  some european countries achieved results substantially higher than the prior year s level  and other countries  most notably germany  the united kingdom  and france  reported results essentially equal to or below the prior year s level 
excluding the negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates principally due to the mexican peso devaluation  sales in the consumer businesses in other geographic regions increased by in over the level 
sales growth occurred in a number of countries  including canada  and most strongly  in brazil  while sales in other countries were essentially equal to or below the prior year s level 
operating income as a percentage of sales for the consumer segment was in compared to in excluding the effect of goodwill amortization  operating income as a percentage of sales would have been in compared to in the household products business achieved strong improvement in operating income in as a result of increased sales volume  higher manufacturing productivity  and actions taken either to improve profitability or to drop certain lower margin products from its product lines 
improved operating income levels in over in the worldwide power tools and accessories business principally resulted from substantial improvements in the domestic power tools and accessories business as a result of increased sales volume  higher manufacturing productivity  and the impact of cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by reduced profitability in the european operations 
a softening retail environment in the fourth quarter of  expenses incurred in connection with the reorganization of certain european operations  and residual inefficiencies associated with the closure of two manufacturing facilities in mid contributed to markedly lower profitability in the consumer businesses in europe in than in cost reduction initiatives and manufacturing productivity improvements resulted in increased operating income as a percentage of sales during compared to in the security hardware business  despite year to year sales declines in its domestic operations due to inventory reductions made by its customers in the latter part of a decline in operating income in the plumbing products business in compared to resulted from reduced sales and rising material costs 
commercial and industrial products the following chart sets forth an analysis of the change in sales for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   by geographic area within the commercial segment 
united total states europe other commercial existing unit volume price currency total commercial total sales in the commercial segment for were higher than the level 
excluding the negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  sales in the commercial segment were higher in than in the fastening systems and assembly fastening business achieved good growth in unit volume in as a result of strong sales in the far east and the continued strength of sales to the automotive industry in the united states  partially offset by protracted softness in the domestic industrial market and in europe 
the glass container forming and inspection equipment glass business also experienced solid growth in unit volume in over the backlog of orders in the glass business at december   was approximately higher than the level 
approximately of the glass backlog at december   represents orders scheduled for delivery in  with the balance scheduled for delivery in operating income as a percentage of sales for the commercial segment was for both and excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and the restructuring charge  operating income as a percentage of sales would have been in compared to in improvements in operating income as a percentage of sales during were experienced in both the fastening and glass businesses 
total sales in the commercial segment for were higher than the level 
excluding the substantial positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  sales in the commercial segment were higher in than in the preceding year 
the fastening business achieved solid unit volume growth in over the prior year s level  as softening sales to general industry in the united states and europe were more than offset by increased automotive sales in those regions 
the glass business experienced a double digit rate of growth in unit volume in compared to a weak despite volume declines in the united states 
operating income as a percentage of sales for the commercial segment was in compared to in excluding the effects of goodwill amortization  operating income as a percentage of sales would have been in compared to in the fastening and glass businesses each experienced improvements in operating income percentages in discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of the results of prc inc  prc realty systems  inc rsi  and prc environmental management  inc 
emi 
together  prc inc  rsi  and emi composed the corporation s former information technology and services prc segment 
operating results  net assets  and cash flows of the discontinued prc segment have been segregated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the results of the discontinued prc segment do not reflect any expense for interest expense allocated by or management fees charged by the corporation 
on february   the corporation completed the sale of prc inc  the remaining business in the discontinued prc segment 
proceeds of million from the sale of prc inc  less cash selling expenses of million paid during  were used to reduce indebtedness 
earnings from discontinued operations of million 
per share on a fully diluted basis in primarily consist of the gain on the sale of prc inc  net of applicable income taxes of million 
the gain is net of provisions for adjustment to the sales price and retained liabilities 
revenues and operating income of prc inc for the period from january   through the date of sale were not significant 
net earnings of the discontinued prc segment were million 
per share on a fully diluted basis in and million 
per share on a fully diluted basis in the corporation sold rsi on march   and emi on september   for aggregate proceeds of million 
financial condition operating activities of continuing operations before the sale of receivables generated cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in cash generation during was primarily the result of improved working capital management  principally resulting from actions taken during to reduce inventories from the high level that existed at the end of in addition to measuring cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statement of cash flows  the corporation monitors free cash flow  a measure commonly employed by bond rating agencies and banks 
the corporation defines free cash flow as cash available for debt reduction including short term borrowings  prior to the effects of cash proceeds received from sales of divested businesses  issuances of equity  and sales of receivables 
free cash flow  a more inclusive measure of cash flow generation than cash flows from operating activities included in the consolidated statement of cash flows  considers items such as cash used for capital expenditures and dividends  as well as net cash inflows or outflows from hedging activities 
during the year ended december   the corporation generated free cash flow of million compared to million in the increase in free cash flow in from the level was primarily the result of improved working capital management 
the total amount of receivables sold under the sale of receivables program at december   was million compared to million at december  the sale of receivables program provides for a seasonal expansion of the amount of receivables that may be sold  from million to million during the period from october through january the liquidity facility that supports the sale of receivables program expires in march the corporation expects to be able to extend this facility beyond december however  due to its improved leverage  the corporation expects to reduce the amount available under the facility to less than million and to eliminate the seasonal expansion feature 
excluding amounts related to discontinued operations  investing activities for used cash of million compared to million in capital expenditures of million during approximated the level of million 
during  approximately of the capital expenditures were in the consumer segment  primarily in support of new product initiatives and productivity enhancements 
the corporation expects capital spending in to moderately exceed the level 
the ongoing costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had  nor are they expected to have  a material adverse effect on the corporation s capital expenditures or financial position 
the corporation has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than countries 
as a result  the corporation is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
the major foreign currencies in which foreign currency risks exist are the pound sterling  deutsche mark  dutch guilder  canadian dollar  swedish krona  japanese yen  chinese renminbi  french franc  italian lira  australian dollar  mexican peso  and brazilian real 
assets and liabilities of the corporation s subsidiaries located outside the united states are translated at rates of exchange at the balance sheet date  as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the resulting translation adjustments are included in equity adjustment from translation  a separate component of stockholders equity 
during  translation adjustments  recorded in the equity adjustment from translation component of stockholders equity  decreased stockholders equity by million compared to an increase of million in as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation historically had hedged a portion of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
beginning in  the corporation decided to limit the future hedging of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
while this decision may increase the volatility of reported equity  it is expected to result in more predictable cash flows from hedging activities 
in hedging the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on its net investments in subsidiaries located outside the united states  the corporation has entered into various currency forward contracts and options 
these hedging activities generate cash inflows and outflows that offset the translation adjustment 
during  these activities netted to a cash outflow of million compared to a cash outflow of million in the corresponding gains and losses on these hedging activities were recorded in the equity adjustment from translation component of stockholders equity 
also included in the equity adjustment from translation component were the costs of maintaining the hedge portfolio of foreign exchange contracts 
these hedge costs  which were not significant in  decreased stockholders equity by million in in late  the mexican peso was severely devalued 
because the corporation s mexican peso exposure was hedged  this devaluation did not have a significant effect on earnings in while the currency situation in mexico had an adverse effect on the corporation s mexican sales in both and  the effect on operating income was substantially offset by pricing actions and changes in cost structures and by the lower relative costs of mexican production during those years 
while the corporation will take actions to mitigate the impacts of any future currency devaluations in mexico or elsewhere  there is no assurance that such devaluations will not adversely affect the corporation 
financing activities for used cash of million compared to million of cash used in as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation  during  replaced its former unsecured revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in  with a new unsecured revolving credit facility  expiring in also during  the corporation reduced its outstanding borrowings by million 
this reduction was funded through the proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and through improved operating cash flows 
during  the corporation recognized a million extraordinary loss  million of which was a non cash charge  as a result of the early redemption in the aggregate amount of million of the sinking fund debentures of its emhart corporation subsidiary 
this extraordinary loss consisted of the write off of the associated debt discount  plus premiums and costs associated with the redemption  net of related income tax benefits 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on october   the corporation  pursuant to its conversion option  issued  shares of common stock in exchange for the  shares of series b cumulative convertible preferred stock previously outstanding 
because the dividend rate on the common stock is lower than that which was paid on the preferred stock  the conversion will result in annualized cash savings to the corporation  at the current dividend rate  of approximately million 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the  shares of common stock issued upon conversion have been considered in the computation of primary earnings per share through the inclusion of those shares  from their date of issuance  in the determination of the weighted average shares outstanding 
those  shares of common stock have been treated as outstanding in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share for the years ended december  and as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to issue debt opportunistically  whether at fixed or variable rates  at the lowest possible costs 
based upon its assessment of the future interest rate environment and its desired variable rate debt to total debt ratio  the corporation may later convert such debt from fixed to variable or from variable to fixed interest rates  or from united states dollar based rates to rates based upon another currency  through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  the corporation may enter into interest rate cap agreements in order to limit the effects of increasing interest rates on a portion of its variable rate debt 
in order to meet its goal of fixing or limiting interest costs  the corporation maintains a portfolio of interest rate hedge instruments 
these interest rate hedges could change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt as actual interest rates move outside the ranges covered by these instruments 
the variable rate debt to total debt ratio  after taking interest rate hedges into account  was at december   compared to at december   and at december  at december   average debt maturity was years compared to years at december   and years at december  the corporation will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest  and to service debt 
in order to meet these cash requirements  the corporation intends to use internally generated funds and to borrow under its unsecured revolving credit facility or under short term borrowing facilities 
management believes that cash generated from these sources will be adequate to meet the corporation s cash requirements over the next months
