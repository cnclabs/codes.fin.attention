phoenix believes it has amassed sufficient size and scope to achieve significant cost savings through deployment of its network  consisting of switching equipment in major metropolitan areas and transmission facilities between these switches 
in contrast to some other ixc s who are investing substantial capital to build networks  the company is deploying its network without substantial capital investment 
this has been made possible by the increasing availability of capacity on switching and transmission equipment on a leased basis from other telecommunications providers 
the ability to lease rather than purchase this capacity  and to expand capacity on an as needed basis  creates a significant opportunity for phoenix to rapidly deploy its network  while preserving most of the company s capital spending budget for the acquisition of additional customer traffic that may be shifted onto the company s network 
by leasing capacity on switching equipment and transmission facilities  phoenix intends to fully deploy and substantially load its planned network by the end of phoenix has entered into agreements to lease switches from us one and other vendors on an as needed basis and to lease fixed cost imts from comdisco and ldds worldcom 
the network also includes three switches located in colorado springs  minneapolis and phoenix which were acquired by the company in connection with the acquisition of aci in january and may include additional switches acquired in the future through acquisitions 
the company expects deployment of the network to significantly reduce the company s average per minute line costs and provide an important competitive advantage compared to resellers and other ixcs without comparable networks 
phoenix currently has agreements with major long distance carriers  such as ldds worldcom  sprint  frontier  at t and others  to carry the majority of its long distance traffic

the company s agreements with vendors specify minimum volume usage requirements  but  in contrast to many of its competitors  such requirements scale down over the next months  thereby freeing traffic to be loaded on the network 
accordingly  minimum volume usage requirements under these agreements  where they exist  should not limit the company s ability to load a substantial portion of its traffic on the network as it is deployed
