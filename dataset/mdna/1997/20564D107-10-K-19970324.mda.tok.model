item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
analysis of operations consolidated operations consolidated revenues for were billion  an increase of million as compared to revenues improved in all segments in with the largest increase  over  recorded in the technology services segment 
the international communications segment revenues improved slightly over last year with increases in both comsat world systems cws and comsat international ci offset  in part  by a decrease in comsat mobile communications cmc 
the entertainment segment revenues improved by in as compared to in october  ascent entertainment group  inc ascent  through its newly formed subsidiary on command corporation occ  acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of spectravision  inc spectravision see note to the financial statements 
consolidated revenues for were million  an increase of million over revenues increased in the international communications and entertainment segments but declined in the technology services segment 
within international communications  cws s and ci s revenues increased over the prior year  while cmc s revenues declined over the largest improvement in revenues was in the entertainment segment where on command video ocv continued to have substantial growth in its hotel business 
operating income in was million  which was million below during  the corporation restructured elements of each of its business segments and recorded a pre tax million provision for restructuring see note to the financial statements 
exclusive of such provision  the decrease in operating income over was million 
excluding the restructuring provision  the technology services segment reflected an increase in operating income  while both the international communications and entertainment segments reported lower operating income 
operating income in was million  a decline of million from exclusive of the restructuring provision and the radiation systems  inc rsi merger and integration costs recorded in  operating income was million  or million below all business segments reported lower operating income in as compared to the initial public offering of common stock of ascent was completed in december the corporation owns of ascent s common stock 
the corporation recognized  in  a million pre tax gain as a result of the public offering see note to the financial statements 
other income expense  net  for was a net expense of million  which was million greater than this was due to a full year of dividend payments on the monthly income preferred securities mips  which were issued in july see note to the financial statements  offset by a million gain on the sale of i co global communications holdings limited ico shares see note to the financial statements 
in  other income expense  net  was a net expense of million compared to a net other income of million for dividends on the mips securities of million were the primary cause of the increased expense in interest costs increased by million in as compared to and by million in as compared to as a result of increases in borrowings 
interest capitalized  primarily on satellite construction projects  declined in by million as compared to  and in by million as compared to  due to the completion of several satellite projects 
income tax expense was adjusted to a higher accrual rate in to reflect increases in non deductible expenses and state income taxes 
in october  ascent s ownership in occ declined to less than 
as a result  occ is no longer a part of the comsat consolidated tax group  and comsat is no longer able to recognize tax benefits from occ losses 
minority interest in net losses of consolidated subsidiaries increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of the minority interest of ascent  net of taxes 
net income for was million  which was million below last year 
earnings per share were  a decrease from net income was million in  a reduction of million from the prior year 
earnings per share for were  down from segment operating results the corporation reports operating results in three segments international communications  technology services and entertainment see note to the financial statements 
the international communications segment includes comsat world systems cws  comsat mobile communications cmc and comsat international ci 
prior to  cmc was reported as a separate segment 
the segment financial information for and has been adjusted to reflect the change in the corporation s segments in in january  comsat international ventures changed its name to comsat international 
in millions revenues international communications world systems mobile communications international total technology services entertainment eliminations and other corporate total revenues  operating income loss international communications world systems mobile communications international total technology services entertainment total segment operating income merger and integration costs provision for restructuring other corporate total operating income international communications international communications includes the fcc regulated and non regulated businesses of cws  cmc and ci 
cws provides international voice  data  video and audio communications as the statutorily designated us participant in the global intelsat satellite system 
cmc provides maritime  aeronautical and land mobile communications services as the statutorily designated us participant in the inmarsat satellite system 
ci operates an integrated group of telecommunications businesses in countries with rapidly growing telecommunications markets and provides individualized digital network solutions to customers located in these markets 
revenues in the international communications segment in were million  which was higher than in  international communications revenues of million improved over operating income in was million  which was below last year 
operating income of million in was below results 
comsat world systems cws s revenues were million  which reflects a increase over the improvement in revenues came primarily from increases in vsat leases  ibs traffic and cws s share of revenues from the intelsat system 
these increases were partially offset by reduced revenues from scheduled rate reductions in long term contracts with at t  mci and sprint  cws s three largest international carrier customers 
cws s revenues of million were higher than revenues from expanded service offerings such as vsat leases  digital audio and wide band mobile increased by 
these increases were partially offset by reduced revenues from voice circuits  which declined due to rate reductions in the long term contracts and the conversion of analog circuits to more efficient digital service 
cws s share of revenues from the intelsat system also declined as a result of a reduction in the corporation s ownership share in operating income in in cws was million  a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease in operating income was the result of a lower investment base upon which the regulated rate of return is calculated 
this was the result of insurance proceeds received from the february launch failure of the intelsat satellite see note to the financial statements 
cws s operating income of million improved over due to decreased operating expenses within the division and cws s lower share of intelsat s costs 
these savings were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from the launch of three intelsat vii satellites in comsat mobile communications cmc s revenues were million  a decrease of as compared to the lower revenues were primarily the result of decreases in analog telephone and telex revenues  expiration of the american mobile satellite corporation amsc service contract in december and lower volume in the bulk service contract with idb mobile communications  inc idb 
cmc s analog telephone and telex revenues declined by from as a result of continued competitive pressures 
cmc s revenues of million were lower than the prior year due to rate reductions and the migration of traffic to less expensive  more efficient digital services such as standard m 
operating income in cmc for was million  or lower than due to lower revenues  increased depreciation expense as two inmarsat satellites were placed in service during and increased costs related to the start up of planet sm service 
cmc s operating income for was unchanged from lower revenues were offset by a reduction in operating expenses and an increase in cmc s share of inmarsat s operating results 
the decline in operating expenses was due in part to lower cmc operating costs and the reversal of inmarsat related costs which were over accrued in comsat international ci s revenues for were million  which reflects growth of over last year 
the majority of the growth originated from companies in brazil and argentina  where the year over year growth was and  respectively 
partially offsetting the increases was a decline in revenues in belcom  ci s company operating in russia and in the commonwealth of independent states cis  due principally to a reduction in equipment sales 
ci s revenue commitments under long term contracts were million at the end of  which more than doubled over ci s revenues in were million  which was higher than this was the result of improvements in latin america and the full year consolidation of the results of belcom 
ci s operating loss in was million  which was less than the previous year s loss of million 
this improvement was primarily the result of the increase in revenues in brazil and a decrease in the operating losses at belcom 
partially offsetting these improvements were start up costs associated with ci s newer companies in china  colombia  india and venezuela 
in  ci experienced an operating loss of million  which was caused in part by losses in belcom 
technology services the technology services segment includes comsat rsi crsi and comsat laboratories 
crsi designs  manufactures and integrates a range of turnkey systems  subsystems and components for advanced microwave  cellular  personal communication services and networks pcs pcn  wireless local loop communication networks  satellite communication  radar and other services 
in addition  the segment provides operations and maintenance  satellite construction monitoring and applied research services 
technology services revenues in were million  a improvement over last year due to increased revenues at both crsi and comsat laboratories 
included in technology services revenues were royalties of million related to a licensing agreement that resolved patent infringement disputes with certain manufacturers of television encryption and decryption equipment 
exclusive of these royalties  technology services revenues improved over this improvement was primarily the result of increases in revenues from the commercial satellite communications initiative csci contract  sales of pcs antennas and the impact of a full year of revenues from jefa wireless jefa and plexsys international plexsys  which were both acquired in the second half of revenues for this segment declined in by million from the prior year due to the completion in of several large international and us government contracts which were not replaced in  a million insurance settlement recorded in at crsi  and the downsizing of one of the laboratories divisions in offsetting the decline  in part  were increases in revenues from satellite services for classified government customers  earth station component sales and the initial consolidation of three companies intelesys  jefa and plexsys that are involved in the manufacture  integration and installation of various wireless components and systems 
technology services operating income was million in  which was better than exclusive of the million in royalties noted above  operating income in the technology services segment was million in as compared to million in this decrease was the result of charges of million taken in the fourth quarter of related to estimated losses on certain long term  fixed price contracts 
the decrease was partially offset by improvements from increased sales of pcs antennas and vsat products 
operating income in declined million from the decline was primarily due to lower revenues  as well as new product development costs associated with newly acquired vsat and cellular product businesses  and the favorable insurance settlement received in entertainment the entertainment segment consists of the corporation s ownership interest in ascent see note to the financial statements 
ascent  through occ and ascent network services  inc ans  provides video distribution and on demand video entertainment services to the lodging industry and video distribution services for the national broadcasting company nbc 
this segment also includes the denver nuggets national basketball association nba franchise  the colorado avalanche national hockey league nhl franchise and beacon communications corp 
beacon  a producer of theatrical films and television programming 
in october  ascent through its newly formed subsidiary  occ  acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of spectravision 
prior to the acquisition  ocv was merged into a subsidiary of occ and became a wholly owned subsidiary of occ 
ascent now owns of the outstanding common stock of occ see note to the financial statements 
the entertainment segment s revenues were million  an increase of over the improvement for includes million of revenue from the fourth quarter acquisition of spectravision by occ  growth associated with the continued installation of new on demand video systems at occ and a full year of revenues for the colorado avalanche  which was acquired in july partially offsetting these increases were lower revenues from the denver nuggets and from beacon  which had no new film releases in in addition  revenues in were lower compared to due to the discontinuance of the satellite cinema business at year end and the absence of any expansion fees from the nba which were received in in  the entertainment segment s revenues were million  which was higher than this increase in revenues was the result of growth in the ocv installed room base  the inclusion of the colorado avalanche for the last half of  revenues from a newly released beacon film and nba expansion revenues 
offsetting these increases were lower revenues from the nbc contract 
in  the entertainment segment s operating loss was million as compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
the increase in the operating loss is primarily attributable to increased losses at the sports franchises and at occ 
occ recognized costs of million relating primarily to asset write downs  reserves and expense accruals associated with the integration of spectravision in the fourth quarter 
the results included million of operating income related to the nba expansion that did not reoccur in the sport franchise results reflect the full year losses of the colorado avalanche  which was not included in this segment s results until july in february  ascent restated its financial statements for the year ended december  to reduce film inventory through a charge to earnings and to change the beacon purchase price allocation between two intangible assets with different useful lives 
comsat s operating loss for the fourth quarter included a negative million adjustment to account for the restatement by ascent 
comsat s financial statements were unaffected by the ascent restatement 
the entertainment segment in reported an operating loss of million compared to operating income of million in the decline in was a result of lower revenues from the nbc contract  losses from the colorado avalanche for the last half of and full year costs for beacon 
additionally  the results include one time charges recorded in connection with the ascent public offering 
these losses were partially offset by receipt of nba expansion fees and improvement in ocv operations 
outlook many of the statements that follow are forward looking and relate to anticipated future operating results 
statements which look forward in time are based on management s current expectations and assumptions  which may be affected by subsequent developments and business conditions  and necessarily involve risks and uncertainties 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual future results will not differ materially from anticipated results 
although the corporation has attempted to identify some of the important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  those factors should not be viewed as the only factors which may affect future operating results 
in march  comsat s board of directors approved a comprehensive strategic plan to refocus the corporation on international satellite services and digital networking services and technology 
the satellite services businesses  which include cws  cmc and comsat personal communications  are well positioned in the international market with a significant ownership interest in the largest fleet of satellites  which covers most of the world s land mass and oceans 
the digital networking services and technology businesses  which include ci and comsat laboratories  develop and operate digital networks in emerging markets and provide advanced technology services 
by focusing on those businesses  and shedding non core operations  the corporation plans to improve shareholder value by strengthening its balance sheet  improving earnings and positioning itself to participate in the growth opportunities that exist in the international satellite and digital networking markets 
as part of the strategic plan  the corporation reaffirmed its commitment to divest its interest in ascent 
in january  the corporation filed a ruling request with the internal revenue service as a predicate to a tax free spin off 
pending the ruling  comsat will continue efforts to identify a purchaser for its interest in ascent 
although the timing may vary depending on which course is taken and factors not within the corporation s control eg  the timing of receipt of a ruling  the corporation anticipates that ascent will be deconsolidated for financial reporting purposes by the end of the first half of the corporation also announced that it intends to sell substantially all of the assets and operations of crsi as well as non core assets 
consistent with that strategy  in late and early  the corporation divested its minority ownership interest in philippine global communications  inc philcom and reduced its ownership interest in ico see note to the financial statements 
the company intends to increase its financial flexibility be refinancing a portion of its long term debt with the proceeds of short term debt 
additionally  the board of directors is reviewing whether comsat should maintain its dividend at the currend level 
the corporation also announced  in connection with the strategic plan  that it will formally petition the fcc in to re classify it as a non dominant carrier and for relief from rate based  rate of return regulation 
there can be no assurance that the fcc will act favorably upon the petition 
international communications the corporation continues to promote efforts to restructure the intelsat and inmarsat satellite systems to ensure that they will remain competitive in the future and to enhance the value of the corporation s investment in those systems 
the corporation believes that considerable progress has been made on the restructuring of intelsat 
in  the corporation worked closely with the united states government to gain support for the creation of a separate  independent company carved out of intelsat to pursue video distribution and other new services 
the existing intergovernmental organization would continue to provide basic public network and other core services 
the corporation believes that there is widespread agreement throughout intelsat for this basic restructuring concept  which was not evident a year ago 
there are a number of important issues that must be resolved  however  before a restructuring of intelsat may be implemented  including the number of satellites to be transferred to the new company  the capital structure of intelsat after restructuring  and the level of ownership in the new company by intelsat and its signatories eg  comsat after a planned initial public offering in of the affiliate s stock 
the intelsat assembly of parties is scheduled to meet in april it will review a report of the working party on restructuring during the meeting 
the assembly is not expected to make a final determination about restructuring but is expected to endorse the overall concept and direction 
additional progress needs to be made on several important issues before a final consensus proposal can emerge for subsequent review and adoption by the assembly 
a consensus agreement of the assembly or a vote of two thirds of the governments that are members of the intelsat consortium is necessary for approval 
the united states government  not the corporation  participates in the assembly and casts a single vote 
the success of the corporation s restructuring efforts will depend on the ability to achieve a consensus among other signatories and participating member governments 
in january  the fcc staff advised comsat that it will need to make application to the fcc to participate in intelsat actions to create an affiliate  including the transfer of satellite assets 
at issue will be the terms and conditions under which those assets may be removed from the corporation s regulatory rate base 
the fcc staff has expressed the view that  since comsat s ownership share of intelsat is reflected in its regulatory rate base  any gain generated as a result of restructuring should be applied against the rate base and inure to the benefit of ratepayers  unless comsat demonstrates sound public policy reasons why a different standard should apply 
comsat believes that any transfer of satellite assets should be effected at book value with any resulting gain derived from the restructuring of intelsat inuring to the benefit of the corporation s shareholders 
comsat world systems continues to be well positioned with major international carriers through long term agreements to provide cost competitive services for bulk usage beyond the year in addition  cws expects growth in several emerging markets  including international vsat service and asynchronous transfer mode atm services 
in addition to eight satellites currently on order  intelsat has signed a lease for capacity aboard the insat e satellite in the asia pacific region  planned for launch in the time frame 
intelsat launched two satellites successfully in and plans for three or four launches in  depending on satellite delivery and launch availability 
the new intelsat viii series satellites will offer higher power c band capabilities to address various markets 
intelsat is nearing the end of an investment cycle in which it has invested heavily in new satellites 
as those satellites are placed in service and begin to generate revenues  the corporation anticipates that cws s free cash flow operating cash flow less capital investment will grow significantly 
cws is expected to face increasing competition over the longer term 
several recently announced or completed acquisitions are expected to significantly increase the competition for international satellite telecommunications services  including the planned acquisition of panamsat by hughes electronics corporation and british telecommunications plc s planned acquisition of mci communication corp 
in late  the fcc substantially eliminated prior restrictions on access of separate system satellite operators to the public switched telephone network 
the remaining restrictions expired as of december  accordingly  separate system satellite operators are no longer subject to any us policy limitations with respect to the number of satellite circuits that they may interconnect with the public switched telephone network 
this will increase competition in the provision of switched services 
comsat mobile communications plans to continue to expand its service offerings and value added products to meet anticipated growth in customers needs 
the increasing number of digital terminals with improved operating efficiency and reduced service charges are expected to continue to provide traffic growth in land mobile  small commercial and pleasure boat  and business traveler markets 
cmc expects to continue to face increasing competition from existing inmarsat service providers  other wireless communications services including c band and other potential market entrants 
in october  cmc reduced its service charges in response to competitive pressures and has solved quality issues in its new digital services 
the lower service prices and a greater prevalence of lower priced digital versus analog telephone service charges are expected to more than offset potential increases in revenues due to traffic growth 
as a result of those factors and the increased depreciation associated with the inmarsat satellites  cmc s operating income is expected to be lower in than in in late  the federal aviation administration faa selected cmc to provide satellite and uplink services for the wide area augmentation system waas 
the initial contract is expected to generate revenues of million and could generate revenues of up to million if all options are exercised over the next five years 
cmc plans to build on its established position in mobile satellite communications as it evolves toward handheld satellite service 
planet sm  the first generation of personal satellite communications  commenced commercial service in january the planet tm terminal is a six pound  laptop computer sized satellite terminal which utilizes the inmarsat satellites 
this product is expected to address the demand for global personal communications ahead of the availability of handheld satellite services 
during  the first three of four operational inmarsat satellites were successfully launched and are now in service 
the planet sm service is expected to be available globally by the second half of  with the launch of the fourth satellite 
in december  the corporation reduced its direct investment in ico from eight percent to three percent see note to the financial statements 
the reduction in ico ownership aligns the corporation s financial interest with its plans to concentrate on developing a national service wholesaler role in the us the corporation also continues to hold an indirect share of ico through its ownership in inmarsat  which is also an ico shareholder 
as with any new product  there are a number of factors that may affect the corporation s ability to offer planet sm and ico services on a profitable basis 
such factors include the level of consumer acceptance and demand  the quality and pricing of competitive services  and the performance of ground and space systems and customer terminals 
in order to offer planet sm and ico services  the corporation must obtain certain regulatory approvals see notes and to the financial statements 
in addition  ico must receive the funding required to complete its satellite system 
comsat international will continue to operate an integrated group of telecommunications companies that are engaged principally in providing individualized digital network solutions to business clients and carriers in selected markets 
ci also plans to develop prospective international telecommunications opportunities that are consistent with its digital networking strategy 
in this regard  ci will continue to target those rapidly growing markets where a significant number of ci s existing or targeted clients are located or in which they intend to locate 
ci s general financial performance benchmark is for individual companies to be operationally cash flow positive within three years and profitable after five years of operation absent unforeseen circumstances or problems 
as part of its integrated approach to management of those companies  ci evaluates operating performance  strategic fit and overall effectiveness of managerial control to determine whether to continue to increase or reduce its investment in individual companies 
ci is currently reviewing its investment in belcom 
in january  ci sold its share in philcom see note to the financial statements 
ci s more mature companies located in argentina  bolivia  brazil and guatemala are expected to be profitable in the aggregate in profits generated from those operations are expected to be offset by losses in ci s newer companies operating in china  colombia  india and venezuela losses at belcom and by management costs in the us in early  the communications secretariat of argentina issued resolutions which reserve for nahuelsat  the domestic argentine satellite operator  certain exclusive rights for the sale of domestic ku band satellite services in argentina 
ci expects that the resolution will be challenged by satellite service providers and users 
comsat argentina has reserved sufficient ku band capacity to address its current and future business requirements through following  however  comsat argentina will be required to secure additional capacity for new business from nahuelsat 
technology services comsat rsi should continue to experience revenue growth in each of its three core groups as a result of strong worldwide demand for wireless and satellite communications infrastructure and increased us government spending on advanced communications products and services 
crsi s backlog rose to million at the end of as compared to million at the end of of the december  backlog  approximately million is expected to be recognized as sales in and approximately million is unfunded 
included in this order backlog is approximately million of us government contracts 
as is customary  these contracts include provisions for cancellation at the convenience of the us government or the prime contractor 
if such a provision were exercised  crsi would likely assert a claim for reimbursement of costs incurred and a reasonable allowance for profit thereon 
crsi s operating income in is expected to improve over operating income  exclusive of the reserves taken in on certain long term  fixed price contracts 
although the increase in operating income may not be at the same pace as the increase in revenues due to costs related to the introduction of new services and products  as well as increasing investment in product development 
additionally  earnings growth at crsi will continue to depend upon crsi s ability to contain costs and complete projects with favorable margins 
entertainment ascent is expected to continue to derive a majority of its revenues from the lodging industry video distribution business 
revenue growth is expected from the continued installation of occ systems for new customers and in spectravision hotels  and the full year impact of the acquisition of spectravision 
contracted revenues for video distribution services provided to nbc entered an option phase in  which resulted in lower revenues and operating income 
in  ans procured and installed digital equipment to provide msnbc  llc  a joint venture between microsoft corporation and nbc msnbc with network services  maintenance and support 
ans anticipates that it will assist nbc in completing the upgrade of the nbc network to digital technology 
the financial performance of the denver nuggets and the colorado avalanche are  to a large extent  dependent on their performance in their respective leagues 
in addition  due to the limitations of the facilities available at mcnichols arena where both teams currently play  ascent believes that projected increases from facilities based revenues will not keep pace with increases in players salaries  which could result in operating losses for as long as they play in mcnichols arena 
ascent plans to construct a new arena and entertainment complex  which is expected to result in improved operating results for both teams 
it is estimated that the arena will cost approximately million 
beacon is expected to release three feature films during and begin production on up to three additional films in  which may be released in there is a significant degree of unpredictability and risk associated with theatrical films 
in october  ascent through its newly formed subsidiary  occ  acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of spectravision 
in addition  ascent s ownership of occ declined at that time to less than 
as a result  occ is no longer a part of the comsat consolidated tax group  and comsat is no longer able to recognize tax benefits from occ losses 
as a result of anticipated continued losses at ascent  primarily as a result of the increased losses associated with the acquisition of spectravision and the impact of the deconsolidation for tax purposes of occ  comsat expects to report net losses in until ascent is no longer a part of comsat s consolidated results 
analysis of balance sheets consolidated balance sheets assets 
the corporation ended with billion of assets  a million increase over current assets decreased during by million primarily due to a decline in cash and cash equivalents of million  which was partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily related to the repayment of loans on corporate owned life insurance policies and additional investment in ico 
the increase in accounts receivable was principally the result of growth in revenues at crsi  higher unbilled crsi receivables and the acquisition by occ of spectravision 
all of crsi s unbilled receivables  except for million  are expected to be collected within one year 
the increase in inventory was due to growth at crsi related to pcs and other products 
non current assets increased in by million to end the year at billion 
of the total increase  million was related to property and equipment 
property and equipment  before accumulated depreciation  increased during the year by million 
the increase in property and equipment was primarily related to the installation of video systems and the acquisition of spectravision at occ  additions related to cws s and cmc s share of intelsat and inmarsat satellite programs and investment in new communication property and equipment at comsat international 
partially offsetting these increases was the receipt in of insurance proceeds related to the launch failure of the intelsat satellite and retirement of fully depreciated satellite assets 
investments increased million during of which million was related to the corporation s direct and indirect investments in ico 
goodwill increased in by million and was principally related to the acquisition of spectravision by occ 
other assets increased by million in as the corporation repaid loans related to corporate owned life insurance policies and beacon made further investments in film inventories 
liabilities 
the corporation s total liabilities increased during by million 
this was primarily the result of increased borrowings of million at ascent  increases in liabilities for the production of films at beacon of million and liabilities of million related to the acquisition of spectravision by occ 
comsat s short term borrowings increased during by million 
analysis of cash flows  liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash from operating activities for was million  which was below the international communications and entertainment segments generated the majority of the corporation s cash from operations 
the corporation made interest payments  net of amounts capitalized  of million and tax payments of million 
during  the corporation used million in investing activities  a decrease over the purchases of property and equipment came primarily from the international communications businesses  as cws and cmc continued to make capital investments equal to their related shares of intelsat s and inmarsat s satellite programs 
ci purchased communications plant and equipment  predominantly related to contracts in latin america 
occ also purchased video on demand equipment 
increases in investments in unconsolidated businesses are primarily related to the corporation s investment in ico 
the corporation expects to make additional investments in property and equipment in  but at a level below the amount expended in a decrease in spending is expected in cws as a large portion of existing satellite program costs at intelsat were expended in prior years 
investments in unconsolidated businesses are expected to be lower in  as a result of a decrease in the corporation s obligation related to ico and the sale in january of philcom 
cash proceeds from financing activities in were a net million  a million decrease from the previous year 
during  the corporation had a net repayment of long term debt of million  repaid loans on company owned life insurance policies of million and paid dividends of million 
cash from short term borrowings of million came principally from an increase in short term debt at ascent of million 
the quarterly dividend has remained at per share throughout and liquidity and capital resources the corporation s working capital at year end was a deficit of million  a decrease of million from a positive million at year end the million decline in current assets was more than offset by the million increase in current liabilities 
the increase in current liabilities  as compared to the prior year  was primarily due to the short term borrowings of million under the ascent and occ credit facilities  million in borrowings under the corporation s commercial paper program  a million increase in deferred income from beacon s film production activities and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities from an increased level of operations 
cash from operating activities and short term borrowings will be used for the near term to fund growth and to finance working capital needs 
the corporation has access to short term and long term financing at favorable rates 
the corporation s current long term debt ratings were downgraded one level in early to a by standard and poor s and to a by moody s 
the corporation s million commercial paper program had million in borrowings outstanding as of december  ascent had million in short term debt outstanding at year end a million credit agreement  expiring in  backs up the commercial paper program 
the corporation s current commercial paper ratings also were downgraded one level in early to a by standard and poor s and to p by moody s 
the corporation had million remaining at year end under a million medium term note program  which is unchanged from year end the medium term note program is part of a million debt securities shelf registration program initiated in as part of its strategic plan see management s discussion and analysis outlook  the corporation intends to tender for a portion of its long term debt using the proceeds from short term debt 
the corporation plans to reduce its short term debt 
the corporation plans to reduce short term debt with proceeds from the sale of assets of crsi and non core assets 
in march  occ amended its credit facility to increase the amount that occ may borrow to million from million 
concurrently  ascent amended its credit facility to reduce the amount which ascent can borrow to million from million and committed to raise not less than million in subordinated debt before october as a condition to further renewal of its credit facility see note to the financial statements 
ascent s management believes that ascent will be able to satisfy the commitment to raise million within that time frame 
there can be no assurance  however  that other contingencies will not arise which could impact ascent s ability to obtain the additional subordinated financing or that such financing will be abailable on terms acceptable to ascent 
if ascent wer not able to obtain the additional subordinated financing  ascent could be required to refinance the credit facility  which could require ascent to reduce or reschedule planned capital investments  reduce capital outlays or sell assets 
the corporation s capital structure and debt financing activities are regulated by the fcc 
the corporation is required to submit its financial plans to the fcc for review annually 
under existing fcc guidelines  the corporation is subject to a limit of million in short term debt  a maximum long term debt to total capital ratio of and an interest coverage ratio of to the latter two guidelines are measured at year end 
in october  the fcc approved a temporary decrease in the interest coverage ratio to a minimum of to  and an increase in the short term debt limit to million for the plan year and until the fcc acts on the corporation s capital plan  which is scheduled to be filed by the end of april the corporation was in compliance with the guidelines  as modified  with a long term debt to total capital ratio of  million in short term debt outstanding and an interest coverage ratio of to at december  if the corporation were to fail to satisfy one or more of the fcc guidelines as of an applicable measurement date  the corporation would be required to seek advance fcc approval of future financing activities on a case by case basis 
if such approval were not granted  the corporation could be required to reduce or reschedule planned capital investments  reduce cash outlays  reduce debt or sell assets
