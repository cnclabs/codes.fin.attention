item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes which follow 
the company s future operating results are likely to be affected by trends and factors which are beyond the company s control 
these include  among other factors  unexpected changes in food manufacturing technology  uncertain business conditions that impact the general food manufacturing industry  government regulation and general economic conditions 
the company s manufacturing processes use certain raw ingredients  including mushrooms  onions and cheese  supplied from outside sources 
any reduction in supply or change in costs of these ingredients may affect the company s ability to meet customer demand 
the company is not currently aware of any such changes in supply or costs of its raw material ingredients  other than cheese 
during  the prices of cheese were volatile and such volatility may continue in during the company continued to broaden its product distribution into new geographic locations and new sales channels to increase its national presence and to provide direct sales and support interface with customers 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective or successful or that the service and support needed to ensure the success of the company s expansion into new territories or new sales channels can be achieved cost effectively 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
many factors  including events affecting the stock market generally  quarterly fluctuations in the company s operating results and general conditions in the economy may affect the price of the company s stock 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the level anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse impact on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
because of all the foregoing factors  as well as other variables  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and management believes that historical trends should not be relied on to anticipate results or trends in future periods
