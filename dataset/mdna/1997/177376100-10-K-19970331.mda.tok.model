reliance upon indirect distribution channels and major distributors 
the company relies significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the marketing and distribution of its products 
the company s distributors and resellers are not within the control of the company  are not obligated to purchase products from the company  and may also represent other lines of products 
need to expand channels of distribution 
the company intends to leverage its relationships with hardware and software vendors and systems integrators to encourage these parties to recommend or distribute the company s products 
in addition  an integral part of the company s strategy is to expand its direct sales force and add third party distributors both domestically and internationally 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could adversely affect the company s operating margins and related cash flows from operating activities 
product returns and price protection rights

international operations 
the company s continued growth and profitability will require expansion of its international operations

effective income tax rate 
during  the company has used substantially all of its income tax net operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  while certain tax credit carryforwards are available to effect future taxable income  the company s effective tax rate in the future will approximate the federal and appropriate states statutory income tax rates 
the anticipated increase in effective tax rate may reduce the company s net income and cash flows from operating activities in growth rate 
the company s revenue growth rate in may not approach the level attained in  which was high  due primarily to the introduction of winframe in late as discussed above  the company believes that its costs of goods sold and certain operating expenses will increase in due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses  together with the possibility of slower revenue growth  the company s income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities may decrease in
