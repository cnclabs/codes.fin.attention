its dynamark subsidiary provides data processing and database management services to businesses engaged in direct marketing activities  many of which are in the credit and insurance industries 
on july  l  the company acquired risk management technologies rmt  a privately held company  which provides enterprise wide risk management and performance measurement solutions to major financial institutions 
the company s historical statements for prior periods have been restated to account for the company s merger with rmt on a pooling of interests basis 
the company is organized into business units that correspond to its principal markets consumer credit  insurance  direct marketing dynamark  enterprise wide financial risk management rmt and a new unit  healthcare information 
sales to the consumer credit industry have traditionally accounted for the bulk of the company s revenues 
products developed specifically for a single user in this market are generally sold on a fixed price basis 
such products include application and behavior scoring algorithms also known as analytic products or scorecards  credit application processing systems asap tm and creditdesk r and custom credit account management systems  including those marketed under the name triad tm

credit scoring and credit account management services sold through credit bureaus and third party credit card processors are generally priced based on usage 
products sold to the insurance industry are generally priced based on the number of policies in force  subject to contract minimums 
dynamark and rmt employ a combination of fixed fee and usage based pricing  and the healthcare information unit intends to employ a combination of fixed fee and usage based pricing for its products 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes 
in addition to historical information  this report includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect the company s future results 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially 
such factors include  but are not limited to  those described in this discussion and analysis 
results of operations revenues the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of revenues represented by fixed price and usage priced revenues from the credit business unit  and the percentage of revenues contributed by the dynamark  rmt  insurance and healthcare information business units  and b the percentage change in revenues within each category from the prior fiscal year 
credit fixed price revenues include all revenues from custom scorecard  software and consulting projects 
most credit usage revenues are generated through third party alliances such as those with credit bureaus and third party credit card processors 
in addition  some credit scorecards and software products are licensed under volume based fee arrangements and these are included in credit usage priced revenues 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to credit fixed price usage priced dynamark rmt insurance healthcare information nm nm total revenues not meaningful revenues from credit application scoring products increased by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal  and by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to the company s sales of new products and increased sales of small business loan scoring products 
asap revenues increased by percent in fiscal l compared with fiscal l  and by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of pc based asap products creditdesk and sales of strategyware tm  a new decision support software product released in september l revenues from sales of credit account management systems triad sold to end users increased by percent from to  but decreased by percent from l to l the major factor in the decline in revenues in fiscal l was a delay in the completion of the next major release of the software 
that release triad was completed in november l the company s high degree of success in penetrating the us bankcard industry with these products has limited  and may continue to limit  the revenue growth in that market 
however  the company has added functionality for the existing base of triad users and is actively marketing triad for other types of credit products and in overseas markets 
usage revenues are generated primarily by credit scoring services distributed through major credit bureaus and credit account management services distributed through third party bankcard processors 
revenues from credit bureau related services increased by percent in fiscal l and percent in fiscal l and accounted for approximately percent and percent of revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from services provided through bankcard processors also increased in each of these years  primarily due to increases in the number of accounts at each of the major processors 
the company provides credit risk management consulting services primarily through crma  which was acquired in september crma completed its first year as part of the credit business unit on september  l crma s revenues were percent of the company s credit revenues 
revenues derived from alliances with credit bureaus and credit card processors have accounted for much of the company s revenue growth and improvement in operating margins over the last three years 
while the company has been very successful in extending or renewing such agreements in the past  and believes it will generally be able to do so in the future  the loss of one or more such alliances or an adverse change in terms could have a significant impact on revenues and operating margin 
revenues generated through the company s alliances with equifax  inc  experian information solutions  inc  formerly trw information systems services and trans union corporation each accounted for approximately eight to ten percent of the company s total revenues in fiscal and on november   it was announced that experian had been acquired by ccn group ltd  a subsidiary of great universal stores  plc 
ccn is the company s largest competitor  worldwide  in the area of credit scoring 
trw experian has offered scoring products developed by ccn in competition with those of the company for several years 
the acquisition had no apparent impact on the company s revenues from experian in fiscal l on september   amendments to the federal fair credit reporting act became effective 
the company believes these changes to the federal law regulating credit reporting will be favorable to the company and its clients 
among other things  the new law expressly permits the use of credit bureau data to prescreen consumers for offers of credit and insurance and allows affiliated companies to share consumer information with each other subject to certain conditions 
there is also a seven year moratorium on new state legislation on certain issues 
however  the states remain free to regulate the use of credit bureau data in connection with insurance underwriting 
the company believes enacted or proposed state regulation of the insurance industry has had a negative impact on its efforts to sell insurance risk scores through credit reporting agencies 
dynamark s revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal the increases in dynamark s revenues excluding inter company revenues were due primarily to increased revenues from customers in the financial services industry 
gross margins for fiscal  and were approximately  and percent  respectively 
since its acquisition  dynamark has taken on an increasing share of the mainframe batch processing requirements of the company s other business units 
during fiscal  such inter company revenue represented approximately percent of dynamark s total revenues 
accordingly  dynamark s externally reported revenues tend to understate dynamark s growth and contribution to the company as a whole 
rmt s revenues for fiscal l increased by percent compared with fiscal l  and in fiscal increased by percent compared with fiscal the rapid growth in revenues in fiscal l was a result of the acquisition by rmt in june l of software alliance corporation  with which rmt had formed an alliance for marketing of all rmt products and sharing of revenues from such product sales 
under the terms of the alliance  rmt received and recorded percent of the revenues from sales made by software alliance 
after the acquisition  rmt received and recorded percent of the revenues from such sales 
increases in insurance revenues for fiscal l  compared with fiscal  were due to strong growth in both insurance products sold to end users and in the insurance scoring services offered through consumer reporting agencies 
the company recorded its first revenues from its healthcare information business unit in fiscal the company s revenues derived from clients outside the united states increased from million in fiscal to million in and to million in fiscal l rmt contributed million  million and million to the company s non us revenues for fiscal years  l and l  respectively 
dynamark has not had significant non us revenues 
sales of software products  including triad and creditdesk  and an increase in the number of accounts using the company s account management services at credit card processors in europe and latin america  accounted for most of the increase in international revenues in fiscal and revenues from software maintenance and consulting services each accounted for less than percent of revenues in each of the three years in the period ended september   and the company does not expect revenues from either of these sources to exceed percent of revenues in the foreseeable future 
during the period since  while the rate of account growth in the us bankcard industry has been slowing and many of the company s largest institutional clients have merged and consolidated  the company has generated above average growth in revenues even after adjusting for the effect of acquisitions from its bankcard related scoring and account management business by deepening its penetration of large banks and other credit issuers 
the company believes much of its future growth prospects will rest on its ability to develop new  high value products  increase its penetration of established or emerging credit markets outside the us and canada and expand either directly or through further acquisitions into relatively undeveloped or underdeveloped markets for its products and services  such as direct marketing  insurance  small business lending and healthcare information management 
over the long term  in addition to the factors discussed above  the company s rate of revenue growth excluding growth due to acquisitions is limited by the rate at which it can recruit and absorb additional professional staff 
management believes this constraint will continue to exist indefinitely 
on the other hand  despite the high penetration the company has already achieved in certain markets  the opportunities for application of its core competencies are much greater than it can pursue 
thus  the company believes it can continue to grow revenues  within the personnel constraint  for the foreseeable future 
at times management may forego short term revenue growth in order to devote limited resources to opportunities that it believes have exceptional long term potential 
this occurred in the period from through when the company devoted significant resources to developing the usage priced services distributed through credit bureaus and third party processors 
expenses the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of net revenues represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statement of income and b the percentage change in the amount of each such line item from the prior fiscal year 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to total revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense nm nm income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income not meaningful cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel  travel and related overhead costs  costs of computer service bureaus  and the amounts paid by the company to credit bureaus for scores and related information in connection with the scorenet r service 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  remained essentially unchanged from fiscal l to fiscal  and declined slightly in fiscal l the decrease in fiscal l was due primarily to the reassignment to research and development activities of certain personnel whose primary assignment had been production and delivery 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of personnel  travel  overhead  advertising and other promotional expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal and further decreased in fiscal l due primarily to a reduction in media advertising 
research and development research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in product development  researching mathematical and statistical algorithms and developing software tools that are aimed at improving productivity and management control 
research and development increased sharply from fiscal l to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal after several years of concentrating on developing new markets either geographically or by industry for its existing technologies  in fiscal and fiscal l the company renewed its historical emphasis on developing new technologies  especially in the area of software development 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation expenses for certain senior management  corporate facilities expenses  the costs of administering certain benefit plans  legal expenses  expenses associated with the exploration of new business opportunities and the costs of operating administrative functions  such as finance and computer information systems 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged for fiscal l  l and l amortization of intangibles the company is amortizing the intangible assets arising from various acquisitions over periods ranging from to years 
the level of amortization expense in future years will depend  in part  on the amount of additional payments to the former shareholders of crma  a privately held company acquired at the end of fiscal l see below  under capital resources and liquidity 
other income expense the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents the detail of other income and expenses 
interest income is derived from the investment of funds surplus to the company s immediate operating requirements 
at september   the company had approximately million invested in us treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments 
interest income increased in fiscal due to rising interest rates and the increasing balance in interest bearing accounts and instruments  and in fiscal due to higher average cash balances 
the company s share of operating losses in certain early stage development companies that are accounted for using the equity method is charged to other expense 
during the quarter ended september  l  the company wrote off non marketable investments with an equity basis of  principally an italian start up venture due to the potential negative impact on the start up s operations from a new privacy law 
in addition  during the quarter ended september   the company wrote off an investment in a different early stage development company due to the deteriorating financial condition of that entity 
the write offs and the company s share of losses in early stage development companies were primarily responsible for the difference between the increase in operating income in fiscal l and percent and percent  respectively and the increase in net income percent and percent  respectively 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s investment in such companies 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was percent  percent and percent in fiscal l  l and l  respectively 
the increase to percent in fiscal was due primarily to the nondeductible nature of goodwill  one time acquisition costs for rmt and an increase in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets 
the company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal to be approximately percent  barring any change in the tax laws 
capital resources and liquidity working capital increased from  at september  to  at september   and to  at september  l the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable  cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses and other assets  which more than offset the increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and unbilled work in progress  which more than offset the increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits and the decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the company s exposure to collection risks is comprised of the sum of accounts receivable plus unbilled work in progress  less billings in excess of earned revenues 
changes in contract terms and product mix  along with variations in timing  may cause fluctuations in any or all of these items 
during fiscal  the increase in accounts receivable and billings in excess of earned revenues were proportional to the increase in revenues 
the greater increase in unbilled work was due primarily to changes in product mix and contract terms 
the company has capitalized as goodwill the amount of  for amounts due to the former stockholders of crma based upon its financial results in fiscal under the crma purchase agreement 
additional payments to the former stockholders of crma based upon crma s financial results in fiscal and may also be required 
those amounts  which will be paid percent in company stock and percent in cash  will not exceed  per year 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization and increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits  partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable 
cash was used in investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment  purchases of interest bearing investments  the acquisitions of printronic and crma  and an earn out payment to the former shareholders of dynamark  partially offset by the maturities of interest bearing investments 
cash was used in financing activities primarily for the payment of dividends and the reduction of capital lease obligations  partially offset by cash generated by the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization  decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets and increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits  partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and unbilled work in progress 
cash was used in investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment and the purchase of interest bearing investments  partially offset by the maturities of interest bearing investments 
cash was used in financing activities for the payment of dividends  reduction of capital lease obligations and repurchase of company stock  partially offset by cash generated by the exercise of stock options 
future cash flows will continue to be affected by operating results  contractual billing terms and collections  investment decisions and dividend payments  if any 
at september   the company had no significant capital commitments other than those obligations described in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company exercised an option to purchase undeveloped land in san rafael  california  with the intention of constructing an office complex to accommodate future growth 
the purchase price is million plus certain costs incurred by the seller as defined in the agreement 
development is expected to commence in fiscal and will involve a material capital commitment by the company 
the company intends to fund the acquisition and development of this land using long term debt  equity or other financing 
excepting external financing of this capital commitment  the company believes that the cash and marketable securities on hand  along with cash expected to be generated by operations  will be adequate to meet its capital and liquidity needs for both the current year and the foreseeable future 
year the company is performing year conversion work on its software products marketed to customers 
the updated versions of its software products currently being shipped to customers are year compliant 
the year conversion work for earlier versions of the company s software installed at customer sites will be performed as part of the company s normal upgrade and maintenance process 
additionally  the company has completed its year audit of internal systems applications and determined that approximately percent of its internally developed systems are year compliant 
applications supplied by third parties are either year compliant or have patches currently available to bring them into compliance 
the company plans to be fully compliant by the end of fiscal l the company cannot now estimate the costs that will be incurred in performing year conversion work 
quarterly results the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents unaudited quarterly operating results for the last eight fiscal quarters 
management believes that all the necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated to present fairly the selected quarterly information  when read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this information includes all normal recurring adjustments that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
quarterly results may be affected by fluctuations in revenue associated with credit card solicitations  by the timing of orders for and deliveries of certain asap and triad systems and by the seasonality of scorenet purchases 
with the exception of the cost of scorenet data purchased by the company  most of its operating expenses are not affected by short term fluctuations in revenues  thus short term fluctuations in revenues may have a significant impact on operating results 
however  in recent years these fluctuations were generally offset by the strong growth in revenues from services delivered through credit bureaus and third party bankcard processors 
management believes that neither the quarterly variations in net revenues and net income nor the results of operations for any particular quarter are necessarily indicative of results of operations for full fiscal years 
accordingly  management believes that the company s results should be evaluated on an annual basis
