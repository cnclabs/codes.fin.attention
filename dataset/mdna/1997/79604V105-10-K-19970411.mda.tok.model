gross margin percentages from united states operations sales declined 
the primary cause of the decrease was higher raw materials costs compared to the prior year  particularly for plastics raw materials and paper product components 
because of strong competition from lower priced imports  the cost increases were not offset by product price increases and  in some instances  were accompanied by sales price decreases 
management estimates higher raw materials costs resulted in a margin decrease of approximately

see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for a discussion of operations discontinued and sold for fiscal liquidity and capital resources one measure of liquidity is commonly referred to as operating cash flow 
operating cash flow is defined as operating income loss adjusted for noncash operating expenses  including amortization and depreciation 
the company believes that operating cash flow provides useful information regarding the company s ability to incur and service debt  but that it should not be considered a substitute for operating income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
other companies may calculate operating cash flow in a different manner and the company s presentation of operating cash flow may not be comparable to similar presentations reported by other companies 
operating cash flow does not take into consideration substantial costs of doing business  such as interest expense  and should not be considered in isolation to or as a substitute for other measures of performance 
operating cash flow does not represent funds available for discretionary use by the company because these funds are required for debt service  capital expenditures to replace fixed assets  and other commitments and contingencies 
operating cash flow for fiscal years ended january    and was computed as follows year ended january  in thousands operating income loss    fresh start amortization and depreciation    operating income before fresh start amortization and depreciation    other amortization and depreciation    operating cash flow    operating cash flow has been reduced for the effects of the provisions for restructuring operations and certain other expenses associated with the restructuring and management team changes as follows year ended january  in thousands operating cash flow    effect of provision for restructuring operations   certain other expenses associated with the restructuring and management changes  operating cash flow adjusted for the effects of restructuring and management changes    operating cash flow  as adjusted for the effects of restructuring and management changes  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million  primarily as a result of the increase in operating income described above 
operating cash flow in fiscal was negatively affected by the effects of the restructuring provision of million and expenses totaling approximately million incurred in fiscal for consulting services in connection with establishing the restructuring plan  the cessation of the former chief executive officer s employment  the hiring of new and additional members of the executive management team  and for expenses incurred in excess of the original provision for the consolidation of american tourister manufacturing facilities 
the company believes that the current level of operating cash flow is adequate to support its existing credit facilities and service the company s series b senior subordinated notes and other long term obligations 
another measure of liquidity is net cash provided by continuing operating activities before reorganization items  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  reflects net cash from operations of the company available for the company s liquidity needs  after taking into consideration the substantial costs of doing business not reflected in operating cash flow 
cash flows provided by continuing operations increased by million in fiscal from fiscal of this amount  million resulted from an increase in cash flow applied for working capital and other operating assets  while cash flows from net income  adjusted for nonoperating and noncash charges and discontinued operations  increased by million 
cash flow provided by used in investing activities decreased from cash provided by investing activities in fiscal of million to cash used in investing activities in fiscal of million  a decrease of million 
of this decrease  million was caused by the nonrecurring payment in fiscal from culligan and proceeds from sale of assets decreased by million because of a nonrecurring sale of an investment in a television station in fiscal capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal consist primarily of tooling for new products  warehouse expansion in europe  and capital expenditures in india for factory construction 
capital expenditures of million in were incurred in the less than owned subsidiaries in italy  singapore and india  and were therefore financed in part by the other shareholders in the ventures 
cash flows used in financing activities decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
net short and long term borrowings were reduced by million in fiscal compared to a reduction in fiscal of million 
in fiscal  the company used the proceeds from debt refinancing and cash flow from operations which were spun off or discontinued to reduce indebtedness  which accounts for the lesser amount of debt retirement in fiscal the company received million from the collection of a note receivable from its former ceo in fiscal and also received million from the sale of common stock to the current ceo and the exercise of employee stock options 
at january   long term obligations including current installments were million  representing a decrease of million from january  at january   the company has million of available borrowings under its us bank credit facility 
in addition  the company s foreign subsidiaries have approximately million available under other short term lines of credit 
at january   the company had working capital of million compared to million at january   an increase of million 
current assets increased by million primarily due to an increase in receivables of million and an increase in inventories of million  both of which were offset by a net decrease in cash and other current assets of million 
receivables increased due to a higher sales level in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in inventories occurred primarily in domestic us operations and resulted from inventories of new products  primarily ez cart tm upright luggage  and an increase in the number of retail stores 
on february   the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock in a public offering and received net proceeds therefrom of approximately million 
in addition  the company s former chief executive officer exercised stock options for which the company received approximately million 
the total of the proceeds from this offering and the exercise of the stock options of approximately million has been applied as follows i the company has retired million principal amount of its series b senior subordinated notes for million which included contractual and market redemption premiums of million  ii the company paid million on the term loan portion of the us senior credit facility  and iii the remainder of the offering proceeds was applied to accrued interest and to repay revolving credit borrowings under the senior credit facility 
the debt repayment accomplished with the stock offering proceeds substantially improves the company s liquidity and debt position and will result in an immediate decrease in cash required for interest expense estimated to be approximately million annually 
the revolving credit line portion of the us senior credit facility remains available to the company 
management is working to renegotiate or amend its us credit facilities during the second quarter of fiscal to reflect its improved financial condition as a result of the public offering 
in addition  the improvement in the company s liquidity will reduce interest rates charged under the us senior credit facility and lower other fees charged under the facility 
the company s cash flow from operations together with amounts available under its credit facilities were sufficient to fund fiscal operations  scheduled payments of principal and interest on indebtedness and capital expenditures 
management of the company believes that cash flow from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities and new credit facilities in emerging markets will be adequate to fund operating requirements and expansion plans during the next months 
in addition  management currently believes the company will be able to meet long term cash flow obligations from cash provided by operations and other existing resources 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has a recorded liability of million for claims associated with two underfunded pension plans made by the pension benefit guaranty corporation as a result of the reorganization of the predecessor company in such amount represents the maximum liability the company would assume should certain events occur 
if the company should ultimately be liable for such claims  management believes that it would be able to satisfy the obligation through payment over an extended period of time in a manner similar to the funding of a pension liability and therefore it does not believe this matter will have a significant effect on its liquidity 
the company has a recorded liability of million to holders of certain notes payable of the predecessor company for interest on overdue installments of interest prior to the reorganization 
the company continues to contest these claims and management of the company believes the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
the company s principal foreign operations are located in western europe  the economies of which are not considered to be highly inflationary 
the economy in mexico is considered highly inflationary beginning february  the company enters into foreign exchange contracts in order to hedge its exposure on certain foreign operations through the use of forward delivery commitments 
during the past several years  the company s most effective hedge against foreign currency changes has been the foreign currency denominated debt balances maintained in respect to its foreign operations 
geographic concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are not significant as a result of the diverse geographic areas covered by the company s operations
