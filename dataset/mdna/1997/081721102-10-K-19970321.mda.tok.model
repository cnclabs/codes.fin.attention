item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes to be relevant to an understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
financial condition reflecting two sales of  million of variable rate revolving home equity lines of credit to trusts created as a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic  the company s leverage the ratio of interest bearing debt to total equity decreased to times at the end of from times at the end of the company also completed a  million securitization in and is planning further securitizations during the company believes sufficient cash resources exist to support its long term growth strategies 
these resources include cash generated by operations including repayments of receivables and the company s ability to obtain additional financing through short term borrowings primarily commercial paper supported by committed bank lines  long term borrowings through both private and public debt offerings and periodic securitizations 
the company s long term debt is rated a or a and commercial paper by all four major rating agencies 
growth in finance receivables is primarily funded through debt issuance 
total owned finance receivables increased  million  or  in  compared with a gain of  million  or  in similar to  growth was the strongest during the fourth quarter and from a product line perspective  was highest in private label revolving charge programs marketed to large regional and national retailers by beneficial national bank usa bnb usa  the company s credit card bank subsidiary 
gains at bnb usa were  million during  resulting in year end receivables of  million 
of these gains  are attributable to three merchants  best buy company  inc of the total gain  kmart corporation and pricecostco inc these three merchants also account for of year end receivables 
reflecting the above mentioned securitizations  variable rate real estate receivables declined million or in personal unsecured receivables increased million or 
in total  unsecured loan portfolios represented of the company s total owned receivables outstanding at year end  versus at the end of and at the end of total managed receivables increased  million  or  compared with a gain of  million or in this trend was in large part the result of growth at bnb usa exceeding growth by million 
reflecting this year s securitizations  as well as the remaining balance of receivables serviced from previous securitizations  total receivables sold with servicing retained were  million at december   compared with  million at year end total loans owned delinquent two months and greater on a contractual basis increased to at the end of from at the end of this increase reflects both a greater proportion of  and higher delinquency in  the credit card and unsecured portfolios in addition to a weaker overall consumer credit environment in north america and the united kingdom 
on a loans managed basis  delinquency similarly increased to at the end of from at the end of the table below details delinquency by product on both an owned and managed basis for and managed basis owned basis delinquency real estate secure personal unsecured credit card sales finance overall net chargeoffs were million versus million in million including the charges related to the company s german liquidating loan portfolio  discussed further in the results of operations that follow 
as a percentage of average receivables  net chargeoffs increased to from in including the german liquidating loan charges 
at year end  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables owned was  compared with at the end of at this level  the allowance covers full year chargeoffs times  compared with times in excluding german liquidating loan charges 
during the year  the balance of the reserve increased million to million 
at march   the company effectively disposed of the million annuity portfolio of the central national life insurance company of omaha  a subsidiary of the beneficial insurance group  inc  to sunamerica life insurance company through a co insurance agreement 
accordingly  approximately million of investment securities were sold or transferred to sunamerica as part of this disposition  which resulted in capital gains on disposition of investments and an million gain  after consideration of related taxes 
although the risks of ownership have been substantially transferred to sunamerica by the co insurance agreement  sunamerica has not yet legally assumed the policies 
therefore  the remaining million in policy reserves related to the annuity portfolio and an offsetting deposit in other assets remain on the company s balance sheet to be reduced as sunamerica legally assumes or rewrites the policies 
these policy reserves declined million through december  investment securities decreased million  or  in  largely related to the disposition of the annuity portfolio 
following the decision to exit the annuity business  and given the one time reclassification allowed temporarily under a guide to implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the company transferred million of debt securities from the held to maturity category to the available for sale category in december  and as a result  a separate component of shareholders equity was increased by million for net aftertax unrealized gains on the transferred securities 
the million reduction in unrealized gains in a separate component of shareholders equity during was largely the result of the annuity portfolio disposition 
see note to the financial statements for more information on investment securities 
on november   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million  or approximately  of outstanding common shares 
the shares will be repurchased from time to time at prices deemed appropriate by the company and will be placed in treasury for general corporate purposes 
this program corresponds to the million in dividends paid by the insurance  commercial banking and canadian subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of results of operations net income in increased to million from million in and million in the earnings improvement in stemmed primarily from the turnaround of the tax refund anticipation loan ral business 
for the year  consolidated results included pretax earnings of million or million aftertax from the ral business  versus a pretax loss of million or million aftertax in and pretax earnings of million or million aftertax in the ral business was severely impacted in when the internal revenue service irs released payment of the earned income tax credit eitc portion on thousands of refunds directly to the taxpayers who had already received the approximate amount of their refunds through the ral program  rather than to the company s banking subsidiary to repay the loan as directed by the taxpayer 
conversely  the ral results benefited from prior year bad debt collections of million as well as smooth and efficient processing of tax refunds by the irs 
for the season  the company s subsidiary  beneficial national bank bnb  did not lend on the eitc portion of any refunds 
in  bnb will resume lending on the eitc portion of refunds  primarily to prior customers in good standing 
in july  bnb signed a new year agreement with h r block tax services  inc  giving bnb the exclusive right to offer rals to eligible h r block block customers in all of block s company owned offices 
in return for the longer term exclusivity given to bnb  the new agreement gives block a share in both the revenue and credit risk of the rals by allowing block financial corporation to purchase an interest in the portfolio of rals originated by block s company owned offices 
for the first two years of the contract  the block interest will be  for years three through  the interest will be 
although some near term profits will be sacrificed  the new agreement provides longevity and stability to bnb s ral product 
prior agreements called for the renegotiation of a contract every three years 
the absolute lending spread increased from the preceding year by in both and  with the increases largely attributable to higher average owned receivables 
as a percentage of average owned receivables  the lending spread was  compared with in and in the average yield on the portfolio was in  compared with in and in over the same periods  interest expense as a percentage of average owned receivables was in versus in and in in north america  the fixed rate real estate secured loans originated in were written at an average yield of  compared with in and in  while variable rate real estate secured loans were written at a spread over prime of approximately basis points in  compared with approximately and basis points during the prior two years 
in  the average yield on unsecured personal loans written in north america was  compared with and in and  respectively 
the average yield on the credit card portfolio was in  versus in and in interest expense decreased million from the preceding year in and increased million in worldwide average borrowing costs decreased to from in and in higher borrowing levels added million and million in interest costs from the preceding year in and  while the corresponding fluctuations resulting from interest rate changes were a decrease of million in and an increase of million in the company minimizes its exposure to interest rate risk by closely managing the gap between its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company utilizes interest rate swaps to moderate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
see notes h and to the financial statements for more information on derivatives 
lending spreads  as a percentage of average receivables  were up modestly from in both the us consumer finance subsidiaries and in the international operations 
the increased lending spread from also reflected a reduced cost of carry on ral receivables 
these favorable trends were mitigated by lower spreads at bnb usa  where the interest margin declined by approximately basis points from this spread reduction was largely the result of a higher proportion of receivables outstanding during the year from special financing plans  which defer customer interest for up to months  as well as a higher level of convenience usage ie  customers paying off balances within the grace period before finance charges accrue 
further  special financing portfolio performance was not consistent with pricing assumptions 
bnb usa is in the process of attempting to rectify these situations 
at december   special financing plans represented of bnb usa s portfolio 
bnb usa profitability was further dampened by million of up front loan loss provisioning on the strong receivables growth experienced in and million of start up costs relating to programs for kmart and pricecostco 
accordingly  bnb usa earnings were at virtual breakeven in  versus pretax profits of million and million in and  respectively 
while management anticipates considerable profit improvement at bnb usa in  the actual results will depend on the outcome of pricing renegotiations with a number of the larger merchants  the magnitude of special financing conversion to standard plans  and the level of continuing start up costs associated with the two new merchant programs 
the beneficial insurance group  inc  reported pretax income of million million excluding the annuity related capital gains in  versus million and million in and these trends reflect the continuation of strong production of credit insurance and well controlled loss ratios 
during the third quarter of  the decision was made to discontinue marketing credit insurance through non affiliated independent credit providers 
the customer base of this business was primarily commercial banks and thrift institutions in the northeast 
this decision will not materially affect either the company s financial condition or results of operations 
harbour island inc  the company s real estate subsidiary in tampa  florida  recorded a pretax loss  on a fully debt funded basis  of million in  down from million in  but increased from million in the results reflect the sale of two luxury apartment complexes at a pretax gain of million 
these sales reduced the company s investment in harbour island by approximately million 
nearly all of the losses in recent years represent imputed interest costs computed at the company s overall melded cost of funds rate and depreciation charges 
the pretax loss relating to harbour island inc is likely to continue at current levels  unless substantial portions of the real estate on harbour island are sold 
other revenues increased in from the preceding year following a decrease of in the increase in other revenue of million related to the previously mentioned turnaround of the ral business  the capital gain related to the disposition of the annuity portfolio  increased servicing revenue relating to securitized receivables and securitization gains of million in versus million and million in and  respectively 
comparing with  the previously discussed fluctuations from the ral business were largely offset by increased servicing revenue and gains from the aforementioned securitization 
the provision for credit losses increased million  or  in compared with an increase of million  or  in excluding the german charge 
the increase in and reflects higher chargeoffs  as well as additions to the allowance for credit losses corresponding to increased unsecured receivables growth 
the increased chargeoffs were entirely in the unsecured product lines  reflecting both the expected maturing of the bnb usa portfolio and a higher incidence of bankruptcies in north america 
as a percentage of receivables  credit card chargeoffs increased to in from in  and personal unsecured chargeoffs increased to from in management expects this credit card trend to continue in though at a less rapid rate of increase than in prior years as the portfolio matures  while the personal unsecured rates will continue to reflect the economic cycle and the economic health of the consumer 
as a percentage of average owned receivables  the provision was  compared with in including the german liquidating loan charges 
salaries and other operating expenses  combined  were up in and in over the respective prior years  generally reflecting normal increases attributable to growth in receivables 
these trends also reflected the previously mentioned costs associated with new merchant programs and expenses relating to a second data center opened during the fourth quarter of the comparisons with the prior year benefited from lower ral collection expenses  and savings from the fourth quarter restructuring 
as a percentage of average managed receivables  salaries and other operating expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
in december  the company announced its intent to sell its german consumer banking subsidiary  bfk bank ag bfk 
simultaneously  the company recorded a million  or per share  charge to reflect potential credit losses and related expenses at bfk on a block of loans granted to finance the purchase of campground sites by german consumers from fundus grundstuecks gmbh fundus  a german financial services company that ultimately went bankrupt 
during  negotiations and other work out efforts relating to the fundus loans  both apart from and in conjunction with the possible bfk sales  did not progress as anticipated in the original loss estimates 
as a result  in december  the company recorded a million  or per share  charge for additional potential losses relating to the fundus portfolio 
in december  the company announced the decision to retain bfk as no acceptable offers were received  and new management was put in place 
following a thorough analysis of bfk s entire loan portfolio  and the supporting collateral  the company recorded a million  or per share provision for loan losses related to other non fundus commercial loans 
none of the above mentioned german charges had a tax offset because of bfk s net operating loss position at that time 
in october  bfk was renamed beneficial bank ag bbag 
also in october  a settlement agreement relating to most of the fundus loans was concluded 
in return for certain cash payments from the borrowers  the loans were canceled and bbag obtained title to the underlying collateral 
the previously established loss reserves were evaluated in light of the settlement and determined to be adequate by management 
the campground sites will be professionally managed until liquidation 
this collateral had a carrying value of million at december  in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented an expense reduction program principally within its headquarters operations 
this program resulted in a million pretax restructuring charge  which was largely early retirement and severance expenses corresponding to workforce reductions of this restructuring charge reduced net income on an aftertax basis by million or per share in although the statutory rate was for all years  the company s effective tax rates were in  in and in the effective rate in benefited from the utilization of approximately million of additional foreign tax credits  resulting from the company s election to modify the methodology for calculating foreign tax credit limitations 
this election is expected to improve the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits in the future with a resulting benefit to the future effective rate 
the effective tax rate was substantially higher in and because of the german charges  which were not offset by tax benefits 
beyond these items  taxes are higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes 
because of the company s earnings level  a valuation allowance is established only on foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the net deferred tax assets is approximately million at december  management has determined  based on the company s history of prior operating earnings and its expectations for future earnings  that operating income of the company will be sufficient to recognize fully these deferred tax assets 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion 
in  the irs completed its examination of the company s federal income tax returns for through and proposed certain adjustments that relate principally to activities of the company s former subsidiary  american centennial insurance company  prior to its sale in although prepayments were made thereon in  the company contested the proposed adjustments within the administrative appeals process of the irs 
during the third quarter of  the irs issued a statutory notice of deficiency asserting the unresolved adjustments 
the company fully intends to oppose the adjustments through litigation 
management does not expect the ultimate resolution of these issues to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion of the assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to implement a broad based option program for substantially all employees who do not participate in the existing option plan 
this program resulted in the issuance of approximately  options on january   at a strike price above the market price at the date of issuance 
see note to the financial statements for further information regarding stock options 
changes in cash flow and liquidity the principal sources of cash are collections of finance receivables  proceeds from the issuance of short and long term debt  and cash provided from operations including maturities and repayments of its receivables 
the monthly collections of cash principal as a percentage of average receivables were in and in also  from time to time  subsidiaries of the company sell home equity loans through securitizations in the capital markets 
substantial additional liquidity is available through committed bank credit lines that the company maintains in support of its commercial paper borrowings 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a billion  five year syndicated revolving credit agreement  which replaced the various one and three year bilateral agreements  totaling billion  that the company had previously maintained 
this syndicated revolving credit agreement has a billion net worth test 
at year end  total standby lines of credit were billion  of which billion was unused 
one of the company s financial strengths is its ability to raise long term debt in a wide variety of domestic and international markets 
including medium term notes  long term debt represented of the company s funding base at the end of  compared with at the end of in  the company issued billion in variable rate medium term notes at an all in cost slightly above the company s cost of commercial paper borrowings 
the average maturity was years 
fixed rate medium term note issuances totaled billion  at an average coupon of and an average maturity of years 
in addition  the company had available under shelf registrations with the securities and exchange commission billion of unissued debt securities at year end the company hedges the majority of its investment in foreign subsidiaries by selling at the money spot call options and buying out of the money spot put options on canadian dollars and british pounds 
with the exception of the strike rates  all terms of the call and put are identical 
the notional amount of each option is an amount that will generally produce offsetting gains or losses on an aftertax basis to the gains or losses produced by the underlying net investment 
the combination of these instruments a no cost collar is effectively a partial hedge  as hedging gains or losses occur only when the spot rates fluctuate outside the range of the respective strike rates 
these option transactions generally have a maturity of three to six months 
foreign currency swaps and forward exchange agreements are also utilized to hedge a portion of the company s investment in foreign subsidiaries 
the company monitors the effectiveness of its hedging program through a quarterly analysis comparing the foreign exchange gains and losses on the investments in foreign operations to hedge gains and losses because of currency fluctuations 
hedge gains and losses are calculated by comparing the option strike rate to the spot exchange rate on each financial statement date as though the option were exercised at that time 
there were no amounts recognized in net income during the three years ended december  gains and losses in excess of the amount needed to offset gains or losses on investments in foreign subsidiaries because of currency fluctuations are not expected given the above hedging strategy 
see notes h and to the financial statements for further information on derivatives 
the company minimizes all off balance sheet credit risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to major international banks and financial institutions 
the company has never experienced nonperformance by any counterparty 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of sfas no sfas as amended by sfas standardizes the accounting and disclosures required for securitizations and transfers and servicing of other financial assets 
the statement is effective for certain transactions occurring after december  the statement will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or result of operations
