cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p the companies cinergy corp  a delaware corporation cinergy or company is a registered holding company under the public utility holding company act of puhca 
cinergy was created in the october merger of psi resources  inc resources and the cincinnati gas electric company cg e 
the business combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
following the merger  cinergy became the parent holding company of psi energy  inc psi  previously resources utility subsidiary  cg e  cinergy investments  inc investments  and cinergy services  inc financial condition competitive pressures electric utility industry cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p introduction the changing competitive environment for energy services continues as the primary factor which will influence the future operations  structure  and profitability of cinergy 
changes in the industry include the convergence of gas and electricity as complementary energy sources  new emerging technologies  the commoditization of electric power  full competition in the wholesale power markets from both traditional electric utilities and new power marketers and brokers  and continuing pressure for customer choice by all classes of customers 
in addition  traditional investor owned utilities are becoming more diversified by using merger and acquisition strategies to support regional  national  and international market strategies 
these merger and acquisition strategies include the combining of electric utilities with one another and cross commodity combinations of electric utilities with gas transmission  distribution  and marketing companies 
pressures for customer choice extending choice to end use customers  sometimes referred to as retail wheeling or retail access  will allow all customers within a particular utility s franchise service territory to unbundle their purchase decisions 
in effect  customers would be allowed to purchase power as a commodity directly from any available source and would buy delivery services ie  transmission and distribution from the local utilities which own the power lines or from independent system operators iso see below 
other value added services beyond delivery to the customer s premises could potentially be provided by third party energy services companies 
the regulatory and legislative reforms to facilitate customer choice are primarily driven by large industrial energy users need to access lower cost power sources  the continuing emergence of new technologies and new marketers to provide electric power  and evidence from other previously regulated industries that wherever effective competition is feasible  it can yield both lower costs and a wider range of customer options and services as compared to traditional cost of service regulation 
the genesis for the new competitors to the local franchise utilities was the enactment of the energy policy act of energy act  which granted the ferc authority to order wholesale transmission access 
as a result  in  the ferc s order ferc order was implemented 
this order encourages full wholesale competition by requiring all utilities subject to the ferc s jurisdiction to make their transmission systems available to power buyers and sellers at prices comparable to those the transmission owner charges itself for comparable service 
these new competitors to the local franchise utility include power marketers  power brokers  and other utilities  who now have the ability to sell power in regional or national markets 
to date  the ferc has granted licenses to more than power marketers  enabling these new competitors to sell wholesale power at market based rates 
cinergy was granted a power marketing license in december power brokers are intermediaries between buyers and sellers and do not take title to the power which they broker 
power marketers conduct bulk power trades at market based prices 
they manage owned generation and portfolios of power contracts  to which they have title  and package energy products for customers of bulk power  including price risk management contracts such as options on fixed price energy and guaranteed fixed price contracts 
power marketers compete not only in price  but also on service  such as structuring  hedging services  and scheduling flexibility 
the demands of industrial and commercial customers continue to drive deregulation into the legislative process in many states 
four states  california  new hampshire  pennsylvania  and rhode island  enacted legislation in which will lead to total customer choice for power supply 
several states have proposed legislation which is currently being debated in their respective legislatures and in most other states the complex technical and economic issues presented by deregulation and restructuring are being discussed and examined 
among other things  states are considering the trade offs between achieving long run economic efficiency and potential short term wealth transfers between customers and shareholders or among customer groups  as well as the potential impact if any restructuring may have on state and local tax structures and socially desirable objectives such as clean air or energy efficiency 
in addition to legislative efforts to totally restructure the electric utility industry  several states have initiated pilot retail access programs which allow a limited number of retail customers the opportunity to shop for electricity among several suppliers 
the most contentiously debated issue has been how best to transition from the historical monopoly cost of service regulated environment to the competitive market driven environment and who will bear the costs of past commitments made under the old order 
if the generation component of the industry was immediately brought to market and priced at competitive wholesale prices  it is likely many utilities would be unable to recover a large percentage of their fixed costs 
other costs such as investments in energy efficiency demand side management dsm investments could also become stranded ie  unrecoverable at competitive market prices in this scenario 
the financial impact to the industry and each investor owned utility of alternative scenarios for a transition to a competitive market is highly dependent upon the speed of the transition and type of price regulation during the transition  the ultimate clearing price for electricity in a competitive environment  and customer behavior when afforded potentially lower cost alternatives 
because of the complex nature of electric power flows  the variety of state by state regulations and the potential inability or unwillingness to shut down high cost  uneconomical generation facilities  such as nuclear  in a fully competitive environment  great uncertainty exists as to the time frame required for the future price of electricity in a commodity market to rise to long run marginal cost eg  full cost of new resources and  importantly  how close to short term marginal cost eg  fuel and variable operating costs prices may fall in the interim 
for example  moody s investors service  inc moody s has estimated the stranded investment issue for the industry at billion computed on a present value basis  while standard and poor s s p has estimated a total exposure of between billion and billion and  respectively of total industry annual revenues 
the position that recovery of prudent past investments and commitments must be considered has received support at the ferc  in ferc order  and in the four states which have enacted competition related legislation see further discussion herein 
in addition either corporate separation and or divestiture continues to be advocated by some constituents in order to protect against market power abuses which could result from one electric utility controlling large segments of generating capacity and transmission assets within a local or regional market 
as a result  electric utilities could face substantial costs to restructure the corporate vertical integration in the delivery of electric power which exists today 
if legal separation is required  for example  first mortgage bond indentures may not allow for major asset dispositions by the electric utility 
in order to legally unbundle  the electric utility could be required to repurchase the outstanding debt under the indenture at substantial call premiums or pay similar fees to the bondholders in order to amend the bond indenture to allow for the unbundling 
at a minimum  regulators will likely mandate functional unbundling of the generation  transmission  and distribution businesses 
in addition  electric utilities could also face substantial costs or competitive restrictions to comply with codes of conduct which are likely to be implemented by regulators to encourage fair competition among the many new competitors entering a market and the local franchise utility 
cinergy s response to the changing competitive environment cinergy continues to be an aggressive supporter of increased competition in the electric utility industry 
cinergy believes competition would benefit electric customers individually and the economy as a whole 
at the same time  cinergy possesses certain competitive advantages  such as low cost generation  which could benefit shareholders in a deregulated environment 
however  these advantages could be substantially eroded by restrictive regulations which lag the development of a competitive market and which limit cinergy s energy commodity and energy services business units ability to preempt the competition in responding to the needs of customers or which result in pricing at the lower of cost or market for former franchise holding utilities 
as such  cinergy will continue its leadership role in both state and federal debates on industry reform 
cinergy believes there are two substantial impediments to realizing the potential efficiencies of competition in the generation component of the business resolving the issue of stranded costs associated with past utility commitments and recognizing states rights  concerns  and authority in regulating a product which flows in interstate commerce 
while cinergy is among the lowest cost producers nationwide and has been recognized by both moody s and s p as having minimal exposure to stranded investment  cinergy nevertheless recognizes the legitimacy of the industry s argument for recovery of at least some of the costs associated with past commitments and the importance of resolving this issue in the interest of moving the debate to more important issues such as  how to achieve the potential economic efficiencies which competition offers and what regulatory and structural reforms are necessary to achieve those results 
cinergy believes that even low cost producers  under certain scenarios  could face difficult if not ruinous competition in an excess capacity market which was created at least in part by past government policies 
cinergy has approximately billion of regulatory assets past costs incurred for which regulators have promised recovery from customers in the future which could be at risk  at least in part  in some scenarios 
at the same time  regardless of certain regulatory actions or statements to the contrary  cinergy believes full recovery of the industry s potential stranded investment is unrealistic to expect in a marketplace where certain customers can bypass stranded cost recovery mechanisms through self generation see trigen energy corporation trigen below  is politically infeasible  and is neither necessarily equitable nor efficient 
cinergy believes the resolution of certain broad restructuring issues eg  market power  codes of conduct  universal service to customers  reliability standards  and certain tax consequences must be addressed on a regional or national basis to prevent state by state disparity which could provide inequitable advantages to some competitors while unduly harming others ability to compete in the marketplace 
during  cinergy has taken numerous steps to prepare itself not only for the changing environment  but to assure equity and consistency in the setting of rules and regulations in the various markets in which cinergy competes  including the following cinergy and five other midwestern utilities formed a coalition to create and develop a multi state transmission region operated by an iso 
since its formation  additional midwestern transmission owners have joined the coalition 
the coalition is proposing a midwest iso which would ensure non discriminatory open transmission access and system reliability  as well as  the development of a regional transmission tariff that helps eliminate the pancaking of transmission rates that occurs today when power is transmitted through multiple utility systems 
cinergy believes the existence of iso s will ease regulatory and customer concerns over the exercise of market power by transmission owning utilities 
cinergy reorganized its electric operations into three strategic business units 
this functional unbundling separated cinergy s electric utility business into an energy services business unit  an energy delivery business unit  and an energy commodities business unit 
each of these separate business units will be responsible for expanding its business through  among other things  expansion of its markets and the offering of new products and services 
cinergy acquired  through a joint venture  a interest in midlands electricity plc midlands  an electricity distribution company located in the united kingdom uk in addition to diversifying cinergy s distribution business into a foreign market  the uk s advanced stage of opening its electricity market to competition will allow cinergy to gain experience and knowledge of customer behavior in a competitive market prior to deregulation in its united states us markets 
cinergy and trigen formed a joint venture to develop and operate cogeneration and trigeneration energy facilities throughout the us and canada 
this will allow cinergy to participate in the delivery of alternative low cost energy solutions and technologies to its own franchise customers and to customers outside of its franchise territory 
cinergy was an active and successful participant in retail access pilot programs in illinois  new hampshire  new york  and washington 
in addition  cinergy intends to be an active participant in certain states restructuring processes 
cinergy s energy commodities business unit accelerated its marketing of power in the wholesale market megawatt mw sales increased by more than 
cinergy now has power marketing representation in all regions of the us in late  cinergy acquired exclusive rights to provide power to two midwestern electric cooperatives for the next five to seven years 
cinergy continued its business reengineering efforts  which were initiated in these initiatives continue to streamline and make operations more efficient in order for cinergy to become even more prepared to compete in a competitive environment 
as discussed below  cinergy worked with industrial groups and one other franchise utility in indiana and is currently working with the other investor owned utilities in ohio to propose customer choice legislation which properly considers the issues and trade offs discussed above 
for an electric utility to be successful in a competitive environment  it is critical that regulatory reform keep pace with the market realities facing electric utilities and their customers not only in generation  but also transmission  distribution  and energy services activities 
strict adherence to traditional  cost based rate of return regulation will both significantly disadvantage a utility s ability to compete successfully to supply customer needs and result in a failure to realize the potential economic efficiencies from restructuring 
for example  performance based regulation for those businesses which remain regulated would result in better economic incentives to control costs and likely add flexibility for the franchise utility in the transition to a fully competitive environment 
federal developments open access transmission ferc orders and the energy act granted the ferc authority to order wholesale transmission access 
acting on that authority  in april  the ferc issued its final orders 
the final rules provide for mandatory filing of open access comparability transmission tariffs  provide for functional unbundling of all services  require utilities to use the filed tariffs for their own bulk power transactions  establish an electronic bulletin board for transmission availability and pricing information  and establish a contract based approach to recovering any potential stranded costs as a result of customer choice at the wholesale level 
the final rules became effective in july psi  cg e  and its kentucky subsidiary  the union light  heat and power company ulh p have made compliance filings with the ferc and are now operating under open access comparability tariffs 
in adopting these rules  the ferc considered  but did not require  the divestiture of any facilities 
additionally  iso s will not be required  however  principles to guide the ferc s evaluation of iso proposals are set forth to encourage their formation 
ferc merger policy in december  the ferc issued a policy statement setting forth new guidelines which address three key factors the ferc will consider in evaluating public utility mergers the effect on competition ie  market power  the effect on rates  and the effect on regulation 
the purpose of the policy statement is to ensure that mergers are consistent with the public interest and to provide greater certainty and expedition in the ferc s analysis of merger applications 
the new guidelines are in response to the continuing changes in the electric power industry and the regulation of the industry and are intended to accelerate the ferc approval process 
a proposed merger s effect on market power will be determined by analyzing the merger candidates share of the defined market in terms of both geographic and product markets 
in cases where utilities may exercise market power  the guidelines encourage the utility to offer potential remedies such as turning over control of their transmission systems to an iso or divesting themselves of generation assets 
with respect to effect on rates  estimates of future costs and benefits of the merger will no longer be required 
instead  the utility should propose appropriate rate protections for its wholesale customers  such as open seasons for customers to terminate contracts  rate freezes  or rate reductions 
repeal of the puhca in  the sec endorsed recommendations for reform of the puhca 
the recommendations call for repeal and  pending repeal  significant administrative reform of the year old statute 
while the recommendation report offers three alternative approaches to repeal and legislative reform  the sec s preferred option is repeal coupled with a transition period of one year or longer and a transfer of certain consumer protection provisions of the puhca to the ferc 
the report further recommends that  pending consideration of legislative options  the sec take prompt administrative action  by rulemaking and on a case by case basis  to modernize and simplify regulation under the puhca  with particular reference to financing transactions  diversification into non utility businesses  utility mergers and acquisitions  and the puhca s integration standards 
in the latter regard  the report recommends a changed interpretation of the puhca to permit registered holding companies to own combination electric and gas utility companies  provided the affected states agree 
subsequent to the issuance of the report  the sec adopted rule changes exempting various types of financing transactions by utility and non utility subsidiaries of registered holding companies 
the sec also proposed a rule which would exempt investments by registered systems in specified energy related companies  subject to certain conditions 
in february  the rule was adopted substantially as proposed 
since the release of the sec s report  numerous bills were introduced in both houses of the us congress providing for the repeal or significant amendment of the puhca 
it is expected that similar bills addressing repeal of the puhca and industry restructuring will be introduced in congress during cinergy continues to support the repeal of the puhca  either as part of comprehensive reform of the electric industry or as separate legislation 
cinergy  cg e  psi  ulh p state developments while the pace of deregulation varies by state and region  nearly all states have initiated or taken part in formal or informal processes  held hearings  and or passed legislation addressing retail wheeling  restructuring  competition  alternative regulation  or closely related issues 
cinergy and cg e ohio the public utilities commission of ohio puco continues to explore potential opportunities under the existing regulatory framework prior to embarking on a more fundamental restructuring which could lead to customer choice 
in april  the puco approved a buy through plan allowing large industrial customers with interruptible contracts to purchase electricity supplies from generators outside the host utility s service territory in order to avoid an interruption in their power supply 
also  in december  the puco issued its order and guidelines for a conjunctive electric service two year pilot program 
under this program  different customer service locations in a service territory may be aggregated for cost of service  rate design  rate eligibility  and billing purposes 
cg e has filed tariffs complying with the buy through order  and will submit tariffs complying with the conjunctive electric service order  during the first quarter of both the interruptible buy through plan and the conjunctive electric service guidelines were initially developed by the ohio electric competition roundtable roundtable 
the roundtable  which was formed by the puco  continues to meet and is currently discussing competitive market structures  including universal service and unbundling 
the puco has approved long term rate plans for two at risk  high cost utilities  with both plans designed to improve the competitive position of the utilities by the end of each respective plan 
one plan involved a price cap  together with provisions allowing for accelerated depreciation and amortization of the utility s nuclear generation and regulatory assets while the second plan involved a rate increase and a recommendation from the puco that the utility develop a plan to reduce the carrying value of its regulatory and nuclear generation assets during the next five years 
neither plan involved provisions for any type of customer choice 
finally  a retail wheeling and industry restructuring bill was introduced in the ohio legislature during the bill  which was not passed during the legislative session  would have restructured the provision of electric service in ohio  allowed all electric consumers to choose an alternative power supplier beginning in  and permit utilities to recover legitimate  verifiable  and fully mitigated costs 
a similar bill house bill has been introduced in the legislative session 
additionally  the state legislature has created a bipartisan joint study committee to make recommendations regarding customer choice legislation 
cinergy is currently working with other investor owned utilities in ohio to propose customer choice legislation and will continue its efforts to bring consumer groups and other stakeholders into the process 
although cinergy is aggressively pursuing customer choice legislation in ohio  the time frame for passage of legislation providing for customer choice is uncertain due to the complex issues and numerous stakeholder interests involved 
cinergy and psi indiana enacted legislation allows the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc to approve utility alternative regulation proposals upon a showing that  among other things  traditional regulation in a particular service sector is no longer needed 
however  during  the iurc did not approve the company s limited customer choice pilot proposals which were included in a general rate case previously filed by psi 
the iurc stated that any type of industry restructuring should be left to the state legislature 
although no formal investigation into electric competition has been initiated  the iurc has continued to sponsor informal competition forums which are designed to develop a better understanding of issues related to expanding the competitive market on both the wholesale and retail levels 
in january  customer choice legislation was introduced in the indiana legislature 
the legislation was drafted by a coalition which included cinergy  the indiana manufacturers association  the indiana industrial energy consumers  inc  and one other indiana investor owned electric utility 
under the proposed legislation  there would be a transition period from october   through june   during which customers would have the right to choose their electric supplier 
those customers not selecting a supplier would continue to buy their electric power from the franchise utility at a total bundled price 
the total bundled price would be frozen at the rate in effect as of july   subject to certain adjustments during the transition period  including limited adjustments for specific material cost changes and a downward trending of the retail electric production component of the total frozen price to the current statewide average 
trending of the frozen price would not be applicable to those utilities  such as psi  whose retail electric production price is currently below the statewide average 
those customers choosing a supplier would pay that supplier s open market price for power and would pay the franchise utility the portion of the bundled price applicable to transmission and distribution services  and an access charge designed to compensate the franchise utility for its loss in revenues  if any  during the transition period  after giving effect to the revenues which would be realized by the franchise utility from sales of the power in the open market 
after june   all customers would continue to have the right to choose their supplier and would continue to pay the franchise utility for transmission and distribution services which would continue to be regulated as to price by the iurc 
the access charge would no longer be paid by any customer 
the proposed legislation provides for each utility to file a transition plan with the iurc which would include  among other things  a proposed amortization period for regulatory asset balances as of the beginning of the transition period 
recovery of regulatory assets during the transition period would be included in retail rates as a charge for transmission and distribution services 
however  any regulatory assets  as well as other stranded costs  at the end of the transition period which are applicable to retail electric production  would be the responsibility of the shareholders 
although cinergy is aggressively pursuing customer choice legislation in indiana  the time frame for passage of legislation providing for customer choice is uncertain due to the complex issues and numerous stakeholder interests involved 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p kentucky there continues to be considerably less activity and interest in industry restructuring in kentucky 
this situation is generally attributable to the fact that kentucky is one of the lowest cost states in the country for electric service 
during  the kentucky public service commission kpsc began an informal investigation into alternative regulation by holding conferences addressing competition and soliciting input from interested parties to determine the appropriate approach to considering such regulation 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p other states as illustrated by the above discussion of customer choice initiatives in the states where cinergy holds franchise agreements  the midwest  traditionally a low cost region  has moved more slowly than the high cost regions of the country 
michigan has a pilot retail wheeling program in place and the state s governor has submitted a restructuring plan which proposes the creation of an iso by and direct access for new commercial and industrial load by illinois  which has pilot retail wheeling programs in place  has several retail access proposals supported by utilities and or consumer groups which may be introduced in the state legislature during outside the midwest  california  new hampshire  pennsylvania  and rhode island  all of which are considered to be high cost states  each enacted legislation during the year which will lead to complete retail competition over the next several years 
several other states likely will enact or at least consider customer choice legislation in other states are pursuing restructuring plans and pilot retail wheeling experiments on a smaller scale to gain real world knowledge on the issues surrounding customer choice 
the california plan  for example  will simultaneously create an iso  a wholesale power exchange  and direct access customer choice phased in over four years beginning january  the plan further provides for a non bypassable competitive transition charge ctc on all retail customers to provide utilities the opportunity for recovery of their stranded costs by the california legislation also allows utilities to securitize a portion of their stranded cost recovery through the issuance of state backed rate reduction bonds 
this will enable the utilities to receive the ctc in advance of payment by customers  thereby allowing for the repayment of higher cost debt with the proceeds from issuance of the lower cost rate reduction bonds 
these cost savings will be used to fund decreases in customers rates 
legislation in new hampshire and rhode island requires customer choice by pennsylvania requires full competition in generation by all three states plans allow for at least partial stranded investment recovery during a transition period 
pennsylvania will also have a structure for utilities to securitize their stranded investment recovery 
cinergy united kingdom transition to full competition in the uk s electric utility industry began with the industry s privatization in when the industry was privatized  the generation  transmission  and regional distribution businesses were  in effect  unbundled into separate companies 
the regional distribution companies  including midlands  own no transmission facilities and are limited as to the amount of generation they may own 
third party access to the transmission and local distribution systems was also put into place  enabling licensed suppliers to use these networks 
upon privatization  customers with a maximum demand of greater than one mw were allowed to buy electricity from any licensed supplier and  since  choice of supplier has been available to all customers with a maximum demand above kilowatts 
beginning in  choice of supplier will be permitted on a phased in basis for all classes of customers 
the distribution and transmission portions of the industry will continue to be regulated 
suppliers purchase their respective power requirements from a pool that was established as part of the overall industry privatization 
generators bid volumes and prices into the pool  which then issues a series of next day half hourly prices to meet expected demand 
suppliers purchase their requirements under this system  but also have the ability to enter into contracts for differences cfds with generators and others 
cfds are used to avoid the uncertainties of pool prices  fix future obligations  and hedge at least portions of the risk of the pool system 
new entrants into the industry have been limited to independent power producers  who compete with the formerly state run generators by using new  efficient technology such as gas fired combined cycle generation 
there have been no new major entrants into the supply business from outside of the industry 
however  it is believed that with full competition for all customer classes in  new entrants  such as retailers  banks  or companies with strong consumer brand names may emerge into the supply business 
approximately of midlands revenues are related to the distribution business which remains a regulated monopoly 
in the supply business  midlands has retained a significant number of its customers who have the ability to choose suppliers and at the same time has gained new customers outside of its franchise territory 
midlands intends to actively pursue expansion of its customer base when all customers gain the ability to choose suppliers 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p the industry and cinergy s future others views the major credit rating agencies continue to recognize the risk of the restructuring of the electric utility industry 
as discussed above  two major credit rating agencies have quantified their views of the potential stranded investment resulting from competition 
in an october report  a credit rating agency stated that credit ratings will remain volatile as individual companies reinvent themselves 
despite these cautious views of the electric industry  cinergy has received praise and some measure of optimism for its position in a more competitive environment 
at its last upgrading of cinergy s operating subsidiaries debt and preferred stock  in november  moody s expressed its opinion that cinergy will have no exposure to stranded costs and that cinergy is expected to be a formidable competitor because of its low production costs 
in its july upgrade of cinergy s operating subsidiaries debt and preferred stock  s p commented that the business position evaluation of all the cinergy operating units is now high average reflecting low electric production costs  efficient coal fired equipment  relatively low rates  a well positioned gas operation  the absence of nuclear challenges  a healthy service territory  and a balanced capital structure 
in october  the energy daily presented its annual corporate leadership award to cinergy  for the aggressive example it has set in moving forward with industry reform and for cinergy having led the search for new and imaginative concepts in the reengineering of the industry 
certain sell side equity analysts continue to rank cinergy highly as a utility possessing a strong competitive profile and aggressive and forward looking management with some considering cinergy prepared to outperform the market in the competitive arena 
in particular  in a recent study of global competition in various industries  cinergy was one of nine energy companies world wide which were identified as most likely to prosper in the more competitive environment of the coming decade 
cinergy believes these opinions further support its position that its competitive strategy and agenda will be successful 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p gas utility industry order in  the ferc issued order order which restructured operations between interstate gas pipelines and their customers for gas sales and transportation services 
order mandated changes in the way cg e and its utility subsidiaries purchase gas supplies and contract for transportation and storage services  resulting in increased risks in meeting the gas demands of their customers 
cg e and its utility subsidiaries have responded to the supply risks and opportunities of order by introducing innovations to their supply strategy 
these innovations include contracting with major producers and marketers for firm gas supply agreements with flexible  market sensitive pricing  marketing short term unused pipeline capacity and storage gas to other companies throughout the country through use of electronic bulletin boards  and restructuring their allotment of interstate pipeline capacity among delivering pipelines 
order also allowed pipelines to recover from customers  including cg e and its utility subsidiaries  transition costs incurred in complying with the order 
in july  the puco issued an order approving a stipulation between cg e and its residential and industrial customer groups providing for recovery of these pipeline transition costs 
cg e is presently recovering its order transition costs pursuant to a puco approved tariff 
cg e s utility subsidiaries  including ulh p  recover such costs through their gas cost recovery mechanisms 
customer choice in a january filing in ohio  cg e proposed to initiate a pilot program which would allow residential customers the ability to choose their gas supplier and have cg e transport the gas for them 
the proposed pilot would extend to residential customers the choice that has been available for several years to large volume commercial and industrial customers 
the puco did not approve cg e s pilot program as filed but directed cg e to meet with interested parties and refine the program in accordance with certain guidelines specified by the puco 
cg e expects to file a modified plan  as directed by the puco  in the second quarter of house bill hb in june  hb was signed into law in ohio 
hb addresses regulatory reform of the natural gas industry at the state level and thus is an extension of order for local distribution companies 
hb  among other things  provides that natural gas commodity sales services may be exempted from puco regulation and that the puco allow alternative ratemaking methodologies in connection with other regulated services 
the puco issued final rules under the new law in march cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p substantial accounting implications historically  regulated utilities have applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation statement 
the accounting afforded regulated utilities in statement is based on the fundamental premise that rates authorized by regulators allow recovery of a utility s costs in its generation  transmission  and distribution operations 
these principles have allowed the deferral of costs ie  regulatory assets based on assurances of a regulator as to the future recoverability of the costs in rates charged to customers 
certain criteria must be met for the continued application of the provisions of statement  including regulated rates designed to recover the specific utility s costs 
failure to satisfy the criteria in statement would eliminate the basis for recognition of regulatory assets 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of statement  became effective in january for cinergy 
statement  which addresses the identification and measurement of asset impairments for all enterprises  is particularly relevant for electric utilities as a result of the potential for deregulation of the generation component of the business 
statement requires the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets when book values exceed expected future cash flows 
in addition  statement imposes a stricter criterion for recognition of regulatory assets by requiring that future recovery be probable at each balance sheet date 
based on cinergy s current regulatory orders and the regulatory environment in which it currently operates  the recognition of its regulatory assets as of december   is fully supported 
in addition  the application of the provisions of statement did not have an effect on reported amounts for regulatory assets and other long lived assets at december  the ultimate outcome of the changing competitive environment could result in cinergy discontinuing the application of statement for its generation  transmission  and or distribution businesses 
as a result  regardless of whether such previously deferred costs would be recoverable ie  covered by revenues in a competitive environment  cinergy would be required to write off the portion of any regulatory asset for which sufficient regulatory assurance of future recovery no longer exists 
in addition  the outcome of applying the provisions of statement could change significantly as a result of future competitive pressures and the type of restructuring of the electric utility industry to which cinergy will be subjected 
cinergy intends to continue its pursuit of competitive strategies which mitigate the potential impact of these issues on the financial condition of the company

regulatory matters cinergy and psi indiana iurc orders psi s retail rate proceeding and dsm proceeding in september  the iurc issued an order september order approving an overall average retail rate increase for psi of million annually 
psi had requested a retail rate increase of million annually 
among other things  the iurc authorized the inclusion in rates of the costs of a mw clean coal power generating facility located at wabash river generating station clean coal project and the costs of a scrubber at gibson generating station 
the order also reflects a return on common equity of  before the basis points additional common equity return allowed as a merger savings sharing mechanism in the iurc s february order february order discussed further herein  with an overall rate of return on net original cost rate base 
the difference between the company s request and the authorized increase is primarily related to return on common equity and the deferral to a separate proceeding of an increase in the level of recovery of dsm costs  as discussed below 
in october  the office of the utility consumer counselor ucc and the citizens action coalition of indiana  inc cac filed a joint petition for reconsideration and rehearing of the september order with the iurc 
the principal issues raised by the ucc and cac are the fair value rate of return and the cut off date for the inclusion of costs to achieve merger savings in retail rates 
psi has filed a response in opposition and cannot predict what action the iurc may take with respect to the requested rehearing and reconsideration 
a settlement agreement between psi and certain intervenors in a proceeding established to review psi s current and proposed dsm programs was approved by the iurc in december the settlement agreement allows psi to recover million per year over the next four years  which is designed to recover all previously incurred  but as yet unrecovered  dsm costs and all costs related to satisfying remaining commitments associated with a previous dsm settlement agreement  together with carrying costs thereon  through a non bypassable charge in psi s retail rates 
the new agreement also authorizes psi to spend up to million annually on ongoing dsm programs through the year and to collect such amounts currently in retail rates 
february order retail rate proceeding and merger savings allocation plan the iurc s february order approved a settlement agreement between psi and certain intervenors authorizing psi to increase retail rates million before credits to base rates of million in and an additional million and million in and  respectively  to reflect the sharing with customers of non fuel operation and maintenance expense merger savings non fuel merger savings 
additionally  the february order provides psi an opportunity to earn up to an additional basis points above the common equity return authorized in the september order until december  in order to be eligible for such additional earnings  psi must meet certain performance related standards 
psi currently meets these standards  which are measured in conjunction with quarterly fuel adjustment clause filings 
after december   the basis point increment to the authorized common equity return will be phased out ratably over a twelve month period 
effective with this order  psi began recovering carrying costs on certain environmental related projects while under construction and prior to the date of an order reflecting such projects in rates 
through this mechanism  revenues were increased by million  million  and million on an annual basis in february  march  and january  respectively 
coal contract buyout costs in august  psi entered into a coal supply agreement with eagle coal company eagle for the supply of approximately three million tons of coal per year 
the agreement  which terminates december   provides for a buyout fee of million including interest to be included in the price of coal to psi over the term of the contract 
this fee represents the costs to eagle of the buyout of the coal supply agreement between psi and exxon coal and minerals company 
the retail jurisdictional portion of the buyout charge  excluding the portion applicable to joint owners  will be recovered through the quarterly fuel adjustment clause  with carrying costs on unrecovered amounts  through december psi has also filed a petition at the ferc for recovery of the wholesale jurisdictional portion of the buyout costs through the wholesale fuel adjustment clause 
generally  the ferc will allow recovery if the utility can demonstrate there will be net benefits to customers during the buyout cost recovery period 
the ferc is expected to issue an order on psi s petition during psi cannot predict what action the ferc may take with respect to this petition
