the company manages the inherently different maturity and re pricing characteristics of its loans and deposits to achieve a desired interest rate sensitivity position and to limit the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the bank s asset and liability committee alco has primary responsibility for managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the alco is comprised of three directors  two officers of the bank and the manager of the bank s secondary marketing department 
the alco meets two times a week to establish interest rates on loans and deposits and review interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that the interest rate risk of the company is properly managed 
the company utilizes a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities repricing or maturing in a given period of time is commonly referred to as gap 
a positive gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities  a negative gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive liabilities over interest rate sensitive assets 
the company s gap position is evaluated continuously and reviewed by the alco in bi weekly meetings 
the company has a negative one year gap of percent as of march  part of the alco strategy for reducing interest rate risk revolves around increasing the percentage of shorter term floating rate loans in the company s portfolio 
this has been accomplished by originating residential construction and adjustable rate permanent loans 
the company continues to originate consumer loans and second mortgage loans 
in general  these loans have short maturities and or have floating interest rates 
the following table presents the company s interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at march  the gap analysis is prepared using either actual repricing intervals or maturity dates

while this loan category increased  or percent  the relative mix to the total loan portfolio remained constant at percent 
residential first mortgages are generally believed to be a conservative investment 
the company s high concentration of residential first mortgages tends to reduce its level of delinquencies and problem loans

in accordance with the company s business plan  the volume of construction lending increased in each of the previous three years 
the company understands the risks inherent in interim construction financing and has designed an efficient organization to properly mitigate those risks through strict underwriting and close monitoring of the process 
the company s underwriting criteria consider  among other things  the equity investment of the borrower  the track record and financial condition of the builder  the demand for the type of house to be constructed including a marketing survey of inventory levels by price range and location  the feasibility of house plans and costs  the growth prospects for the economy and the impact of changes in interest rates 
the company has a multistate construction inspection and appraisal network 
its staff closely monitors construction progress and draws throughout the process

management and the acc consider numerous factors in identifying potential problem loans including  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  specific loan problems  economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  past payment experience  general market conditions and such other factors as management or the acc believes should be considered under existing circumstances 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review the reserve for loan losses 
such agencies require the bank to recognize additions to the reserve based on judgments with regard to information available to them at the time of the examination 
management is not aware of any loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful or substandard that i have not been disclosed and ii either a represent or result from trends or uncertainties  which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or b represent material credits in which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
construction and acquisition and development loans comprise the largest component of the company s loan portfolio 
construction loans frequently involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans principally due to i the creditworthiness of construction borrowers in general  ii the potential risks associated with securing permanent financing  and iii general market conditions in the housing industry 
the company s investment in equipment leases involves risk because of i the decline in value of the leased equipment  ii the company s reliance on third party lessors for servicing the leases  and iii the location of lessees outside the company s geographic market 
management believes that the bank s credit review and loan monitoring processes are adequate to evaluate and monitor these risks and that the bank s allowance for possible loan losses is adequate in relation to the composition of its loan portfolio 
although the company s non accrual loans as a percentage of total loans was percent at march   there is a risk that the quality of the company s loan portfolio could decline 
the rapid growth in loans  the concentration of construction loans  and the risk inherent in lease portfolio each present a risk the quality of the loan portfolio could decline 
management and the acc  along with regulators  closely monitor total exposure to each market area and price range in determining the appropriate concentrations of construction loans

the company recognized interest income on impaired loans of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the company uses either the cash or cost recovery method to record cash receipts on impaired loans that are on non accrual 
under the cash method  contractual interest is credited to interest income when received 
this method is used when the ultimate collectibility of the total principal is not in doubt 
loans on the cost recovery method may be changed to the cash method when the application of the cash payments has reduced the principal balance to a level where collection of the remaining recorded investment is no longer in doubt

percent of average loans receivable versus 
percent for fiscal and 
percent in charge offs increased due to the decline in the quality of the company s lease portfolio 
charge offs related to this decline were primarily related to a single lessor in the amount of  all outstanding obligations of this lessor have been charged off to the reserve and  therefore  no further reserve is required in connection with this relationship 
loan loss reserves totaled  and  respectively  at march  and loan loss reserves to total problem assets decreased percent from percent at march  to percent at march  an allocation of the reserve for loan losses has been made according to the respective amounts deemed necessary to provide for the possibility of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
although other relevant factors are considered  the allocation is primarily based on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional reserve amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
management believes that the reserves for losses on loans are adequate based upon management s evaluation of  among other things  estimated value of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and composition of the company s loan portfolio

unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the bank s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management the asset and liability committee alco manages the company s liquidity needs to ensure there is sufficient cash flow to satisfy demand for credit and deposit withdrawals  to fund operations and to meet other company obligations and commitments on a timely and cost effective basis
