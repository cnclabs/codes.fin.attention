the company presently does not utilize rate protection agreements or derivatives arrangements 
the company s rationale for not hedging its currency risk exposure through derivatives arrangements is based on the assessment that the net foreign currency position was not material to the financial condition or results of operations of the company at december  and  to a lesser degree  an assessment that the risk of loss from exchange rate fluctuations was not material based upon available forecasts of short term exchange rate movements for the currencies noted above

no provision for any liability that may result from these actions has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
risk factors that may affect future results this document may include forward looking statements 
any statements contained herein that do not describe historical facts are forward looking statements 
the company makes such forward looking statements under the provisions of the safe harbor section of the private securities litigation reform act of the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations  but are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements include the general economic conditions and growth rates in the power protection industry and related industries  pricing pressures  changes in product mix  changes in the seasonality of demand patterns  inventory risks due to shifts in market demand  component restraints and shortages  expansion of manufacturing capacity  risks of nonpayment of accounts receivables  and the risk factors set forth below 
fluctuations in revenue and operating results the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the growth rates in the ups industry and related industries  timing of orders from  and shipments to  customers  the timing of new product introductions and the market acceptance of those products  increased competition  changes in manufacturing costs  changes in the mix of product sales  inventory risks due to shifts in market demand  component constraints and shortages  risks of nonpayment of accounts receivable  expansion of manufacturing capacity  factors associated with international operations  and changes in world economic conditions 
management of growth the company has experienced  and is currently experiencing  a period of rapid growth which has placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on the resources of the company 
in order to support the growth of its business  the company plans to significantly expand its level of operations during if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
competition the company believes it is one of five global companies providing a full range of ups products and services in the to kva market 
the ups industry  however  is highly competitive on both a worldwide basis and a regional geographic basis 
the company competes  and will continue to compete  with several us and foreign firms with respect to ups products  both on a worldwide basis and in various geographical regions  and within individual ups product and application niches 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and a number of companies which may enter the company s existing or future markets 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s revenue and profitability through price reductions and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in the ups industry are product performance and quality  marketing and access to distribution channels  customer services  product design and price 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully with its existing competitors or will be able to compete successfully with new competitors 
technological change  new product delays  risks of product defects the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors 
the timely availability of new products and enhancements  and their acceptance by customers are important to the future success of the company 
delays in such availability or a lack of market acceptance could have an adverse effect on the company 
although the company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from product defects  there can be no assurance that  despite testing internally or by current or potential customers  defects will not be found in products  resulting in loss or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key employees the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of its key management  sales  marketing  research and development and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
the company does not have employment contracts with most of its key personnel 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  and management  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
foreign operations  risk of currency fluctuations the company manufactures and markets its products worldwide through several foreign subsidiaries and independent agents 
the company s worldwide operations are subject to the risks normally associated with foreign operations including  but not limited to  the disruption of markets  changes in export or import laws  restrictions on currency exchanges  potentially negative tax consequences and the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects 
international sales sales to customers outside the united states  both direct and indirect accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales in  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenue 
during  the company began invoicing its customers in great britain  france and germany in their respective local currencies and during the second quarter of began invoicing its customers in japan in yen 
to date  the company does not utilize any rate protection agreements or derivative agreements to hedge any foreign exchange exposure 
accordingly  the company may be exposed to exchange losses based upon currency exchange rate fluctuations  which losses could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
dependence on sole source suppliers some components of the company s products are currently obtained from single sources 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company s suppliers will be able to meet the company s demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company generally purchases these single or limited source components pursuant to purchase orders and has no guaranteed supply arrangements with the suppliers 
in addition  the availability of many of these components to the company is dependent in part on the ability of the company to provide the suppliers with accurate forecasts of future requirements 
the company has generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of parts and components in a timely manner from existing sources 
the company s operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  any key components 
uncertainties regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology the company s success will depend  to a large extent  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets and copyrights to protect its proprietary rights 
although the company may apply for patents in the future  there can be no assurance that the company s intellectual property protection will be sufficient to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  the company s business may be adversely affected by competitors that independently develop functionally equivalent technology 
the company attempts to ensure that its products and processes do not infringe patents and other proprietary rights  but there can be no assurance that such infringement may not be alleged by third parties in the future 
if infringement is alleged  there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that the company would prevail in any such challenge 
integration of acquired businesses the company consummated its acquisition of systems enhancement in february systems enhancement currently operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company has limited experience in integrating acquired companies or technologies into its operations 
the company may from time to time pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets  products or technologies 
there can be no assurance that products  technologies  distribution channels  key personnel and businesses of systems enhancement or any other acquired companies will be successfully integrated into the company s business or product offerings  or that such integration will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that any acquired companies  assets  products or technologies will contribute significantly to the company s sales or earnings  that the sales and earnings from acquired businesses will not be adversely affected by the integration process or other factors 
if the company is not successful in the integration of such acquired businesses  there could be an adverse impact on the financial results of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisition transactions in the future 
possible volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  challenges associated with integration of businesses and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
