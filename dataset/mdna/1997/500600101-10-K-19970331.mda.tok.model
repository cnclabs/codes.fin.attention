however  the company  as permitted will continue to apply apb opinion no 
 which recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily though private placements of its equity securities  the initial public offering of its common stock in april  another public offering in march  research and development revenue  and sales of its custom wafer engineered materials and flat panel display devices and products 
the company currently has an unused line of credit of  at year end 
the company periodically enters into loan agreements to finance equipment purchases and other activities 
as of december   sales of equity securities have raised approximately  including  of net proceeds from the company s initial public offering   of net proceeds from the company s march public offering   from a private stock sale in november   from the exercise of a  share stock warrant in december  and  from private stock sales to telecom holding co  ltd 
and united microelectronics corporation and its affiliate in the fourth quarter of the company has commitments of approximately  under existing research and development contracts and customer purchase orders to be fulfilled during and however  some of these commitments are pursuant to contracts that may be terminated prior to completion of funding 
funding for these contracts is contingent upon satisfactory performance and the attainment of certain milestones 
as of december   the company had cash and equivalents and marketable securities of  and working capital of  compared to  and  as of december  during  cash and equivalents and marketable securities decreased  the decrease in cash and equivalents and marketable securities is primarily due to  of cash used in operations and  for capital expenditures 
these decreases were partially offset by borrowings of  and  in equity financing raised by one of the company s subsidiaries from certain of its minority stockholders 
the company also has approximately  of marketable securities held in escrow as equipment financing collateral which is shown in other assets 
revenue from long term contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio that incurred costs or hours bear to estimated total completion costs or hours 
amounts received under long term contracts are recognized as revenue is earned  and amounts earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings are classified as unbilled receivables 
unbilled receivables are billed based on dates stipulated in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon the company s invoicing cycle 
the company has unbilled accounts receivable of  in compared to  in the company periodically enters into various long term debt arrangements in connection with acquisition of certain capital equipment 
during  the company entered into two equipment financings totalling  and a capital lease obligation of  as of december   long term debt obligations totalled  of which  is payable in during  the company made principal payments on long term debt of  in october  the company entered into a five year lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility 
this facility  which includes  square feet of environmentally controlled clean rooms  is being used for expansion of the company s manufacturing capabilities for production of wafer engineered materials and electronic imaging devices 
the company will make lease payments of approximately million over the five year term 
the company expects to expend approximately  on capital expenditures over the next months 
of this amount  approximately  is expected to be used for expansion of manufacturing equipment required for development and manufacturing of electronic imaging devices and display products  and wafer engineered materials  and the balance is expected to be used for the acquisition of laboratory and testing equipment and general facility upgrades 
the company expects to use approximately  in   in and  in for capital equipment and expansion of the company s manufacturing capabilities 
the company also expects to use approximately  for development of advanced display circuit designs for its electronic imaging devices 
the company expects to incur significant additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to the continued development and commercialization of its electronic imaging devices and display products 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the establishment of collaborative arrangements  the cost of manufacturing facilities  commercialization activities and arrangements  continued scientific progress in its imaging device and display product development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  and competing technological and market developments 
from time to time  kopin may also make equity investments in other companies engaged in certain aspects of the flat panel display and electronics industries as part of its business strategy 
from october through december   the company made a series of investments in forte technologies  inc  a developer and manufacturer of virtual reality head mounted systems  totalling  as a result of declining sales and results of operations at forte  the company recorded a write down of the value of forte s assets and its investment in forte at december  totaling  and is evaluating its strategic options regarding its investment 
in march  forte filed a voluntary petition seeking protection from its creditors under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of such filing  the sales of forte s products may decline significantly from levels achieved in  and forte may be unable to continue its operations 
the company believes that its present cash and equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to finance its anticipated operating and capital requirements and to meet liquidity needs through at least fiscal risk factors certain of the statements contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  including the following risk factors 
imaging devices and display products  uncertainty of successful commercialization the company s product sales have been derived primarily from its custom wafer engineered materials and not from its imaging devices and display products 
to date  the company has demonstrated and had limited sales of active matrix lcds and related display products based on its core technology 
continued development and testing are necessary before such a smart slide imaging device or the company s proposed display products will be generally available for wide spread commercial end use applications 
delays in development may result in the company s introduction of a smart slide imaging device and its display products later than anticipated  which may have an adverse effect on both the company s financial and competitive position 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company will ever be successful in commercializing a smart slide imaging device or any of its proposed display products 
in addition  there is no assurance that a smart slide imaging device or any of the company s display products will be technically or commercially successful 
competition and technological advances the markets for electronic imaging displays  display products and computer peripherals are highly competitive 
the company s ability to compete will depend in part upon the consistency of product quality and delivery  as well as pricing  technical capability and servicing  in addition to factors within and outside its control  including the success and timing of product introductions by the company and its competitors  product performance and price  product distribution and customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are equally or more effective than any which are being developed by the company or which would render the company s technology  imaging devices or display products obsolete and non competitive 
in addition  certain competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and other resources than the company 
the electronic imaging display  display product  computer peripheral and gallium arsenide materials industries have been characterized by rapid and significant technological advances 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be reflective of such advances or that the company will have sufficient funds to invest in new technologies or products or processes 
patents and protection of proprietary technology the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on the ability of the company and its licensors to maintain the proprietary nature of their respective technologies 
although the company has been licensed under  awarded or has filed applications for numerous patents in the united states and foreign countries  there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection offered by these patents  or as to the likelihood that pending patents will be issued 
there can be no assurance that competitors  in both the united states and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  will not seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make and sell its products or intentionally infringe the company s patents 
the defense and prosecution of patent suits is both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to the company 
this is particularly true in foreign countries because the expenses associated with such proceedings can be prohibitive 
in addition  there is an inherent unpredictability regarding obtaining and enforcing patents in foreign countries 
an adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties  or require the company to cease selling its products 
the company also relies on unpatented proprietary technology and there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to the company s proprietary technology 
limited manufacturing history  dependence on integrated circuit manufacturers the company has limited experience manufacturing imaging devices or display products 
the company has developed manufacturing facilities and capabilities and entered into arrangements contemplating the establishment of a full scale manufacturing capability for smart slide imaging devices 
these arrangements include relationships with third party integrated circuit fabrication companies 
the company is dependent on these integrated circuit fabrication companies for the manufacture of its smart slide imaging devices 
the termination or cancellation of the company s agreements with these companies could adversely affect the company s ability to manufacture its proposed products 
in such event  the company could be required to establish an alternative manufacturing relationship or establish its own integrated circuit fabrication capability 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to establish such a relationship on acceptable terms or its own capability  in any event the time required to establish such a substitute relationship or capability could substantially delay the commercialization of the company s smart slide imaging devices and display products  which in turn  could have a substantial adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
dependence on single customer the company s gallium arsenide materials business is highly dependent on one customer  rockwell international 
either the loss of this customer or a significant reduction in orders from this customer would have a material adverse effect on the company s gallium arsenide materials business and the company s results of operations as a whole 
seasonality the company s business is not seasonal in nature 
inflation the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflationary forces
