item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations profile sheldahl creates and distributes thin  flexible laminates and their derivatives to worldwide markets 
the company s laminates are of two types adhesive based tapes and materials  and its patented adhesiveless material  novaclad 
from these materials  sheldahl fabricates high value derivative products single and double sided flexible interconnects and assemblies  and substrates for silicon chip carriers 
background in  the company developed a business strategy focused on achieving leadership in supplying the automotive electronics market with flexible interconnects based on the company s core materials technologies 
management believed the automotive market provided growth opportunities due to increasing electronic content of automobiles as manufacturers focused on enhancing vehicle performance while reducing weight and overall vehicle costs 
the company targets specific automotive customers that it has identified as leaders in the drive to increase the electronic content of automobiles 
while marked the first time in ten years that the company s sales to automotive customers declined  this strategy has been successful 
since  automotive market sales increased from million to million and represent of the company s revenue 
concurrent with the company s strategic shift to focus on the automotive electronics market in  sheldahl began to focus its research and development expenditures on new opportunities 
as a result  in the company patented its novaclad high performance adhesiveless flexible laminate 
the features of novaclad allow circuitry designers to increase circuit density for integrated circuit ic packaging and other interconnect solutions 
the company also developed viagrid  a higher value form of novaclad with predrilled small holes vias that allow printed circuit manufacturers to produce flexible interconnects that are up to six times more dense than current technology 
the company uses viagrid to manufacture chip carrier substrates viathin primarily for ic packages 
in fiscal  a consortium was organized through the advanced research projects agency arpa of the us department of commerce to develop a high density  low cost multichip module utilizing novaclad as the substrate material 
the arpa consortium  comprised of a vertically integrated team of non competing companies  has achieved various milestones  including validation of each of the essential processes for production of the company s chip carrier substrates as the base material for low cost multichip modules 
in june  with the assistance of funding from arpa  the company established a prototype production facility  and late in calendar year  began construction of its new manufacturing facility in longmont  colorado  for the production of novaclad based products in commercial quantities 
the company has experienced a variety of delays  including delays in equipment delivery  product specification  full qualification  and in place assembly capacity 
volume production is expected to begin in fiscal during the delay  the company has been working with leading customers  including motorola  texas instruments  and asat  inc  in design  manufacture  and qualification of both chip scale and ball grid array packages 
the adverse financial impact of the production delay at the micro products facility has been and will continue to be significant 
in  the micro products operation resulted in a pretax loss of million as compared with a million loss in these losses are expected to continue until efficient volume production and related sales revenue are achieved 
the company expects to continue to make substantial investments in production capabilities to support its strategy of increasing penetration of the automotive electronics market and commercializing its novaclad and chip carrier substrate production for the datacommunications market 
during fiscal years   and  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million to increase the production capabilities of its current operations 
through fiscal  the company made capital expenditures exceeding million in connection with the company s longmont manufacturing facility 
on september   the company sold its aviation lighting product line to the bf goodrich company for approximately million  enabling the company to focus on its emerging products  flexible interconnects  and flexible laminates operations 
the aviation lighting product line generated sales of million in fiscal year and was insignificant to the overall operations of the company 
during october  the company signed a memorandum of understanding with longtime technical partner  sumitomo bakelite co  ltd  tokyo  japan 
this memorandum documents the intention of both parties to enter into a cooperative development to produce and sell chip scale integrated circuit packages based on the company s novaclad substrates 
if the market for chip scale packages develops as anticipated  the company expects to sell significant quantities of viathin material to sumitomo in japan 
eventually after market demand increases  the company and sumitomo intend to form a joint venture that will manufacture viathin material in asia for sale to integrated circuit manufacturers and assemblers 
results of operations fiscal reflects two major situations inventory adjustments and strikes in the automotive sector throughout the year as well as a longer than anticipated qualification cycle in the company s micro products operation 
each event was responsible for about half of the decline in earnings in from those of the following table shows the percentage of net sales represented by certain line items from the company s consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal years ended august  august  september  net sales cost of sales gross profit expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development interest

the impact to the company was realized by above normal shipments in quarter iv of fiscal and a sharp reduction in shipments in late quarter i and early quarter ii as inventory levels were adjusted 
additionally  there have been numerous automotive industry work stoppages that have impacted the company s sales of automotive laminate and flex circuitry products 
the growth in the automotive market sales for fiscal and was due to the company s efforts to penetrate the automotive market through the use of creatively designed flexible interconnects and laminate materials 
the company enjoys a favorable position in targeted segments of the automotive market  including modular assembly  engineering control  and instrumentation  and has increased sales revenue in that market at an average annual compounded rate of over since automotive market sales represented of company sales in compared to in datacommunications market sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was due to increased sales of laminate materials and flexible circuit products 
in recent years  the company focused its attention on the automotive market as the company s adhesive based laminates were more suited to automotive applications 
however  interconnect systems made with high density novaflex  originally sold for engine control units in the automotive market meet the requirements for computer and telecommunication applications 
therefore  the company targets significant growth in datacom market from not only micro products as the longmont  colorado  facility begins volume production  but also interconnect as high density novaflex is sold to meet the demands of this market 
the company s sales to the aerospace defense market decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal lower sales of insulation blankets for the nasa space station program as well as reduced sales to commercial satellites account for this decline 
increases in and were due to an increased demand for multilayer insulation blankets for satellites 
annual fluctuations of demand in this market are natural  since production cycles often extend more than one year 
the aerospace defense sales reflect the use of the company s core materials technology in vacuum deposition and material handling 
industrial and consumer market sales for declined slightly  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales were million 
although sheldahl has not specifically focused on these markets  the company s laminate materials and flexible interconnect products have developed small  well established market niches for specific applications
