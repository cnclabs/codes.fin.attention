interest rate risk interest rate risk is a measure of exposure to changes in net interest income and theoretical market value of net assets due to changes in market interest rates 
the differential known as gap  is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities over a specified period of time and represents a measure of sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
a positive gap indicates an excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities  while a negative gap indicates an excess of interest bearing liabilities over interest earning assets 
gap analysis does not consider the effects of the velocity of interest rate changes  competitive factors or consumer preferences  and as such may not be a reliable indicator of interest rate risk 
first liberty s interest rate risk will generally be more positive or asset sensitive than depicted through gap analysis 
in addition to gap analysis  management also employs a cash flow simulation model to estimate changes in net interest income and theoretical market values under various interest rate scenarios 
the cash flow simulation model considers the impact of principal amortization  estimated prepayments and the velocity of interest rate changes and can be used to model the effects of competitive factors and consumer preferences 
as such  the cash flow simulation will generally provide a better indication of interest rate risk 
first liberty measures interest rate risk from several sources including repricing risk  option risk  basis risk and liquidity risk 
however  the two principal measures used to monitor risk are the volatility of net interest income and the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
the interest sensitivity of financial instruments measures how quickly each instrument reprices or matures 
a balance sheet which has a relatively short effective life generally has less interest rate risk 
management considers assets and liabilities which mature or reprice within one year to be interest rate sensitive 
as of september   million or of interest earning assets were interest sensitive and million or of interest bearing liabilities were interest sensitive 
a year earlier  of interest earning assets and of interest bearing liabilities were interest sensitive  before restatement for mgb pooling 
the volatility of net interest income reflects how the interest rate characteristics of financial instruments will work together in various interest rate environments over a fairly short period generally one to two years 
to evaluate risk of net interest income volatility  management must not only assess current financial attributes  but also forecast future business activity  consumer behavior and future economic trends 
during  interest rates were generally stable except for a federal reserve tightening by increasing the targeted fed funds rate from to in march which was promptly followed by an increase in the prime lending rate 
despite first liberty s asset sensitivity which indicates a bias toward rising rates  the interest rate spread remained relatively stable as the slight benefit from interest rates was offset by a slight compression in earning asset yields and funding rates 
loan demand remained robust during requiring the acquisition of deposits from wholesale sources to supplement retail deposit growth 
wholesale deposits are generally less labor intensive than retail deposits but may carry a higher interest rate 
management uses such funding sources when they represent the lowest all in cost of funds 
wholesale deposits represent of total deposits at september  management measures the risk of net interest income volatility by the percentage exposure of forecasted net interest income under stable rates to various rate scenarios 
during  management initiated a plan to reduce the level of bias toward rising interest rates 
during  management completed this plan 
as of september   management estimates that first liberty is slightly more at risk to declining interest rate environments than rising interest rate environments reflecting a slightly asset sensitive position  but the relative level of risk was essentially neutral 
interest rate sensitivity short term analysis the following table summarizes the repricing of first liberty s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at september  the information presented may not be indicative of actual future trends of net interest income in rising or declining interest rate environments dollars in thousands

the repricing of loans does not include amounts attributable to the amortization and estimated repayment of principal 
the estimated repricing of savings and interest bearing checking accounts was based on the office of thrift supervision decay rates 
loan loss provision and allowance for loan losses during fiscal  the provision for estimated losses on loans was million compared to million during and million during during  total loans held for investment increased by while nonperforming loans decreased by 
during  the level of consumer bankruptcies and consumer charge offs increased 
during fiscal  net charge offs were million or 
of total loans compared to million or 
of total loans in fiscal substantially all of the increase in net charge offs related to consumer loans 
net charge offs on consumer bankruptcies were million or of net charge offs for net charge offs on indirect auto loans were million in or of net charge offs 
excluding consumer loans in bankruptcy and indirect auto loans  the net charge offs would have been million or 
of average loans for this trend experienced by first liberty is believed to be indicative of trends in most financial institutions 
considering the growth in loans and the overall trends in the level of credit risk  the provision for estimated losses on loans increased million in inclusive of million in non core charges as compared to as the concentration of indirect auto loans decreases  the level of consumer bankruptcies and consumer loans charge offs should also decline 
however  management estimates the core provision in to be reflective of recurring portfolio risk and would anticipate that the level of future loan loss provisions would continue to increase consistent with the level of loan growth 
loan loss reserves are determined based on management s internal review of nonperforming loans  delinquency trends  the level of rated assets and charge off trends 
additionally  management assesses general and specific economic trends both nationally and locally and regulatory information to determine the impact of those external factors on loan loss reserve levels 
based on the internal and external reviews  liberty bank segregates its loan portfolio by type of loans and by loan classification within each loan type 
reserve percentages are applied based on historical and anticipated loss rates to each loan group to determine the required amount of allocated general loan loss reserves 
additionally  an amount is provided for unallocated general loan loss reserves reflecting the potential for estimation errors in allocated reserves 
the allocation of the allowance for estimated losses for the years indicated was as follows dollars in thousands september  amt amt amt amt amt first mortgage residential  commercial    residential construction commercial business      consumer      unallocated      total      loan categories as a percentage of total loans held for investment

nonperforming assets and credit risk the table below summarizes nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  foreclosed properties and insubstance foreclosures  as well as loans past due days or more as to interest or principal and still accruing 
material potential problem loans  ie  those with respect to which management has serious doubts regarding the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms have been classified as nonaccrual loans regardless of payment status  and therefore are included in liberty bank s nonperforming assets dollars in thousands

troubled debt restructurings     at the time of foreclosure all properties are valued at fair value 
fair value is evaluated in light of a current appraisal and an assessment of market conditions 
the evaluation results in a disposition plan including a financial plan designed to monitor the net realizable values of the properties during the marketing period 
the plan is regularly monitored and amended as necessary to accommodate changing market conditions 
at times  some properties net carrying values may be reduced to facilitate near term liquidation  particularly if the marketing period has been extended beyond the original plan 
at september  foreclosed properties included five commercial properties with aggregate investments net of reserves of approximately  the remaining balance of foreclosed properties consisted of residential properties 
during fiscal  management elected to writedown six commercial properties in the amount of million  which were reserved for in prior years  as discussed below  due to the permanent impairment of such assets 
during fiscal and  five of the six properties were sold 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  all remaining commercial properties were reevaluated in light of current economic conditions 
in several cases  management elected to reduce the net carrying value of certain properties by increasing reserves to facilitate near term liquidation 
as a result of the reductions  liberty bank recorded a provision of approximately  on october  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  an amendment of sfas no 

as a result  the following loans were considered impaired as of september  and dollars in thousands
