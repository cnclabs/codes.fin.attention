overview the company has historically derived the majority of its revenue and earnings from providing healthcare services in an inpatient setting 
payments from third party payors are the principal source of revenue for most healthcare providers 
in the early s  many third party payors sought to control the cost of providing care to their patients by instituting managed care programs or seeking the assistance of managed care companies 
providers participating in managed care programs agree to provide services to patients for a discount from established rates  which generally results in pricing concessions by the providers and lower margins 
additionally  managed care programs generally encourage alternatives to inpatient treatment settings and reduce utilization of inpatient services 
third party payors established managed care programs or engaged managed care companies in many areas of healthcare  including behavioral healthcare 
the company  which  until june  was the largest operator of psychiatric hospitals in the united states  was adversely affected by the adoption of managed care programs as the principal cost control measure of the third party payors 
prior to the first quarter of fiscal  the company was not a provider of behavioral managed care services 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired a ownership interest in green spring 
at that time  the company intended to become a fully integrated behavioral healthcare by combining the managed behavioral healthcare products offered by green spring with the direct treatment services offered by the company s psychiatric hospitals 
the company believed that an entity that participated in both the managed care and provider segments of the behavioral healthcare industry could more efficiently provide and manage behavioral healthcare for insured populations than an entity that was solely a managed care company 
the company also believed that earnings from its managed care business would offset  in part  the negative impact on the financial performance of its psychiatric hospitals caused by managed care 
green spring was the company s first significant involvement in managed behavioral healthcare 
subsequent to the company s acquisition of green spring  the growth of the managed behavioral healthcare industry accelerated 
under the company s majority ownership  green spring increased its base of covered lives from million as of the end of calendar year to million as of the end of fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of over 
while growth in the industry was accelerating  the managed behavioral healthcare industry also began to consolidate 
the company concluded that consolidation presented an opportunity for the company to increase its participation in the managed behavioral healthcare industry  which the company believed offered growth and earnings prospects superior to those of the psychiatric hospital industry 
therefore  the company decided to sell its domestic psychiatric facilities to obtain capital for expansion in the managed behavioral healthcare business 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold the psychiatric hospital facilities  which comprised substantially all of its domestic acute care psychiatric hospitals and residential treatment facilities  to crescent for million in cash before costs of approximately million and certain other consideration 
the sale of the psychiatric hospital facilities provided the company with approximately million of net cash proceeds  after debt repayment  for use in implementing its business strategy 
the company used the net cash proceeds to finance the acquisitions of hai and allied in december the company intends to further implement its business strategy through the acquisition 
see item business the transactions 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its managed care business 
a significant portion of the company s managed care revenue and earnings are generated from risk based products  and such portion will increase following the acquisition 
the company believes enrollment in risk based products will continue to grow through new covered lives and the transition of covered lives in aso and eap products to higher revenue risk based products 
risk based products typically generate significantly higher amounts of revenue than other managed behavioral healthcare products 
because the company is responsible for the cost of care  risk based products typically have lower margins than non risk based products 
the company continually focuses on reducing its cost of care

the franchise fees represent a significant portion of the company s earnings and cash flows 
the following is a discussion of certain matters related to the company s ownership of cbhs that may have a bearing on the company s future results of operations 
cbhs may consolidate services in selected markets by closing facilities depending on market conditions and evolving business strategies 
for example  during fiscal and  the company consolidated  closed or sold and psychiatric hospitals  respectively 
during fiscal  the company consolidated or closed three psychiatric hospitals  exclusive of the crescent transactions 
if cbhs closes additional psychiatric hospitals  it could result in charges to income for the costs attributable to the closures  which would result in lower equity in earnings of cbhs for the company 
the company s jv hospitals and cbhs hospitals continue to experience a shift in payor mix to managed care payors from other payors  which contributed to a reduction in revenue per equivalent patient day in fiscal and a decline in average length of stay in fiscal  and management anticipates a continued shift in hospital payor mix towards managed care payors as a result of changes in the healthcare marketplace 
future shifts in hospital payor mix to managed care payors could result in lower revenue per equivalent patient day and lower average length of stay in future periods for the company s jv hospitals and cbhs hospitals  which could result in lower equity in earnings from cbhs for the company 
the hospitals currently managed or operated by cbhs  including hospitals closed or sold in  reported a reduction in equivalent patient days  a reduction in average length of stay and a decrease in admissions in fiscal compared to fiscal the budget act  which was enacted in august  includes provisions that eliminated the tefra bonus payment and reduced reimbursement of certain costs previously paid by medicare and eliminated the medicaid disproportionate share program 
these provisions  along with other provisions in the budget act  will reduce the amount of revenue and earnings that cbhs hospitals will receive for the treatment of medicare patients 
cbhs management estimates that such reductions will approximate million in fiscal  and due to the phase in effects of the bill  approximately million annually in subsequent fiscal years 
based on projections of fiscal operations prepared by management of cbhs  the company believes that cbhs will be unable to pay the full amount of the franchise fees it is contractually obligated to pay the company during fiscal the company currently estimates that cbhs will be able to pay approximately to million of the franchise fees in fiscal  a to million shortfall relative to amounts payable under the master franchise agreement 
the company may be required to record bad debt expense related to franchise fees receivable from cbhs  if any  in fiscal or future periods if cbhs s operating performance does not improve to levels achieved prior to the consummation of the crescent transactions 
if cbhs defaults in payment of the franchise fees  the company will pursue all remedies available to it under the master franchise agreement

during december  the company purchased hai and allied for approximately million and million  respectively  excluding transaction costs 
in addition  the company incurred the obligation to make contingent payments to the former owners of hai and allied 
with respect to hai  the company may be required to make additional annual contingent payments of up to million to aetna during each of the next five years 
the company is obligated to make contingent payments under two separate calculations 
under the first calculation  the amount and timing of the contingent payments will be based on growth in the number of covered lives during the next five years 
the company may be required to make contingent payments of up to million per year for each of the five years following the hai acquisition depending on the net annual growth in the number of lives covered by certain hai products 
the former owner of hai will receive a specified amount per net incremental life covered by such products 
the amount to be paid per incremental covered life decreases during the five year term of the company s contingent payment obligation  reflecting the added value to the company of obtaining a covered life in the early years of the period 
under the second calculation  the company may also be required to make contingent payments of up to million per year for each of five years based on the net cumulative growth in the number of lives covered by certain other hai products

such contingent payments are subject to an aggregate maximum of million 
the company believes that the cash flow generated from its operations  including implementation of the integration plan  together with amounts available for borrowing under the new credit agreement  should be sufficient to fund its debt service requirements  anticipated capital expenditures  contingent payments  if any  with respect to hai  allied and cmg and other investing and financing activities 
the company s ability to make capital expenditures and to incur additional indebtedness are restricted by its debt instruments 
such restrictions  together with the highly leveraged financial condition of the company subsequent to the transactions  could limit the company s ability to respond to market opportunities 
the covenants contained in the new credit agreement will also  among other things  restrict the ability of the company to dispose of assets  repay other indebtedness  amend other debt instruments including the indenture pay dividends  create liens on assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or advances  repurchase common stock and make acquisitions 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas  which applies to entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock 
fas replaces apb opinion  earnings per share and related interpretations 
apb opinion required that entities with simple capital structures present a single earnings per common share eps on the face of the income statement  whereas those with complex capital structures present both primary and fully diluted eps 
primary eps shows the amount of income attributed to each share of common stock if every common stock equivalent were converted into common stock 
fully diluted eps considers common stock equivalents and all other securities that could be converted into common stock 
fas simplifies the computation of eps by replacing the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
fas requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps by entities with complex capital structures 
basic eps includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity  similar to fully diluted eps under apb opinion fas becomes effective for financial statements for both interim and annual periods ending after december  earlier application is not permitted 
the company will adopt fas during the quarter ended december   which is the first quarter of the fiscal year ended september  the company has disclosed pro forma eps amounts computed using fas in note to the financial statements for the years ended september   and after the effective date  all prior period eps data presented will be restated to conform with the provisions of fas the primary effect of fas on the company s financial statements is the required dual presentation of basic and diluted income per common share for each interim and annual reporting period 
apb opinion no 
allowed entities with complex capital structures to present income per common share excluding common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities if the dilution was less than three percent
