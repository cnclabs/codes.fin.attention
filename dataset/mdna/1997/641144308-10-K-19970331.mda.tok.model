item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and include  among others  those discussed under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
industry background the personal computer has evolved from a stand alone desktop computing device to become an important tool for facilitating communications  information sharing and group productivity 
this evolution has been enabled by the addition of network connectivity to personal computers and is driven by basic business needs for better communications and organizational productivity 
as a result  the pc has become a tool to connect people s desktops to shared repositories of information and to other people  regardless of location  network or type of computer 
the term used to describe the technology for global connectivity is inter networking 
inter networking had its origins in the public internet  a world wide network of networks which allows communication between different organizations and locations  each with its own individual network of computers 
the application of this same inter networking technology within a company on its own computer networks is known as an intranet  to distinguish it from the larger public internet 
the key benefit of inter networking technology is the more timely and complete communication of electronic information within and between organizations 
the specific tasks facilitated by inter networking are numerous and include basic functions such as universal electronic mail  file transfer and file sharing capabilities  remote data access  login to remote computers and information publishing 
widespread popular interest in the public internet has been enhanced by the emergence of the world wide web  which has given an attractive graphical front end to information that can be published using inter networking technology 
inter networking is actually much more than just the web  however 
it is comprised of many different applications which must communicate with one another  each according to its function  and following certain standards or conventions which insure interoperability 
in order for a network to function properly  all connected devices must follow rules or protocols that govern access to the network and communication with other devices 
tcp ip is the name of the protocol family used by all inter networking devices and applications because it is an open non proprietary protocol capable of linking disparate environments 
netmanage was one of the first software vendors to deliver the tcp ip protocol and related applications for the microsoft windows platform 
selling primarily to the business user  netmanage has promoted standards based on its implementation of tcp ip that have been adopted by the industry at large 
the most notable example is the windows sockets  or winsock interface which is used today by a wide range of windows inter networking software vendors including microsoft corporation microsoft 
the company believes that because of the open and interoperable characteristics of inter networking technology  the use of tcp ip based intranets and the software that enables them will continue to grow significantly within organizations  and may emerge as the dominant corporate networking technology replacing other proprietary lan local area network technology from vendors such as novell  inc novell  international business machines ibm  and digital equipment corporation digital 
a corporate intranet may be applied to a wide range of business problems 
within organizations  pcs must be connected not only to other pcs via lans  but also to workstations  servers  minicomputers and mainframes  many of which may run different operating system software and connect to different physical networks 
in addition  more companies are seeking ways to link their computer systems directly with those of vendors  customers and other business partners to enhance the flow of information and reduce expenses 
inter networking also facilitates activities such as mobile computing by allowing users to use and access more effectively all of a company s computer systems from a remote location 
the required software to implement an intranet includes applications for the desktop  the software which transports information over the wires tcp ip  the servers at the other end  and management and development tools to create and administer a network of this type 
an easy to use  intuitive interface extends the use of these software components to a large  non technical audience and facilitates adoption of this new technology 
the company has targeted its products to serve three business market segments within what is now called the intranet 
these three segments are the unix connectivity business  the ibm host connectivity business  and the messaging and collaboration business 
the company believes that the markets for these pc connectivity solutions are large and fast growing segments where the company has established products  reputation and expertise 
products and technology netmanage develops and markets a suite of applications designed to allow pc users to communicate across diverse networking environments 
targeting initially the microsoft windows platform  the company now sells products which run on microsoft windows  windows  and windows nt 
the netmanage product line includes client applications  tcp ip network transport software  server applications and tools for developers and network managers 
these software products are designed to meet the needs of the entire spectrum of corporate customers including  end users  software developers and system administrators 
with this breadth and depth of product offerings  the company believes it is well positioned to serve the needs of business users with a complete integrated solution for intranet software sales  service and support 
the capabilities of the company s products include ease of use the company s goal is to create applications for non technical users 
accordingly  the native look and feel of netmanage products is designed to be intuitive to the user and compatible with the operation of other familiar desktop programs  thereby masking the complexities arising from communicating with a variety of systems and facilitating use of the product without requiring special training 
the products are designed to be setup on any desktop in five minutes and to determine with minimum user intervention all the appropriate settings and installation parameters for each desktop s configuration and network 
for corporate users  the cost of training  installation  and support can exceed software acquisition costs 
the benefit of ease of use is significant to netmanage s target market 
integration netmanage offers a fully integrated suite of applications 
customers do not have to buy terminal emulation from one vendor  file transfer from another  electronic mail from yet a third vendor  and a web browser downloaded from the internet each with its own setup  user interface and feature set 
the common characteristics of the product suite tend to increase user satisfaction and product utilization 
further  the client applications are built in such a way as to be manageable by a system administrator  and compatible with custom intranet applications built using netmanage developer toolkits 
a well integrated product lowers the cost of ownership and increases product value to the customer 
functionality the depth and completeness of the applications in netmanage products is designed to compete with best of class functionality from specialist vendors in each category 
the value proposition of the netmanage offering is enhanced by eliminating multi source product purchases with no compromise on advanced software functionality 
the economic proposition for the customer is enhanced by purchasing software and service from a single vendor 
adherence to standards the very foundation of the internet is predicated upon the notion that any client can talk to any server  and that all apis application program interfaces and protocols are published as free open standards 
in the corporate computing environment it is impossible to guarantee a common set of software on every client and every server 
netmanage s commitment to open standards insures that the plug and play interoperability that has made the internet successful extends to the corporate intranet as well 
the company s principal product line is marketed under the name chameleon 
the chameleon family of products encompasses a suite of over integrated connectivity applications 
these applications deliver standards based solutions for host access  messaging  group collaboration and desktop management 
other key products include software for terminal emulation and host access  networked information management and network application development 
the company s products include chameleonnfs x a complete pc to unix connectivity solution for windows  windows nt  and windows includes an nfs client and server and an x server 
chameleon hostlink terminal emulation and host connectivity to legacy mainframe  and mid range systems using sna or async protocols and featuring a migration path to tcp ip 
chameleon lt a low cost  small footprint solution for pc to ibm mainframe connectivity 
ecco pro an award winning networked personal information manager  featuring group calendaring and scheduling capabilities 
z mail messaging an open standards  cross platform e mail solution family that includes clients and a server 
substantially all of the company s net revenues have been derived from the sales of products that provide inter networking applications for the microsoft windows environment and are marketed primarily to windows users 
as a result  sales of the company s products would be materially adversely affected by market developments adverse to windows 
in addition  the company s strategy of developing products based on the windows operating environment is substantially dependent on its ability to gain pre release access to  and to develop expertise in  current and future windows developments by microsoft 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to provide on a timely basis products compatible with future windows releases 
the company s competitors could seek to expand their product offerings by designing and selling products using tcp ip or other technology that could render the company s products obsolete or adversely affect sales of the company s products 
for example  microsoft  a company with significantly greater financial  development and marketing resources  has recently introduced a personal information manager and has included this product in a suite of software 
this development may adversely affect the company s sales of its own products either by directly affecting customer purchasing decisions or by making potential customers delay their purchases of the company s products 
sales and marketing the company s marketing strategy is to be identified as the preferred supplier of an integrated set of tcp ip applications  servers and development tools for microsoft windows operating systems 
the company s products are marketed and sold in the united states and internationally by the company s direct sales force and authorized channel partners 
in the united states  the company combines an aggressive program of advertising and promotion with direct sales through a telephone based sales force  assisted by designated personnel specifically assigned to the needs of major accounts 
as part of its continuing strategy to develop multiple distribution channels  the company expects to increasingly utilize resellers  particularly value added resellers and systems integrators  in addition to distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
the company expects that indirect sales will grow as a percentage of both domestic and total revenues and that any material increase in the company s indirect sales as a percentage of revenues will adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit costs that are typically charged when selling through indirect channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract resellers and distributors who will be able to market the company s products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
the company ships products to resellers and distributors on a purchase order basis  and many of the company s resellers and distributors carry competing product lines 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any reseller or distributor will continue to represent the company s products  and the inability to recruit or retain important resellers or distributors could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
internationally  the company has sales offices in london  munich  paris  tokyo  and haifa  israel 
the company also utilizes local distributors internationally 
the company supports the sales activity of these sales offices and distributors in target countries through localization of products and sales material  local training and participation in local trade shows 
in  the company derived approximately of net revenues from international sales  including export sales 
the company believes that the potential international markets for its products are substantial  based on the extent to which windows and tcp ip are used internationally 
accordingly  the company localizes its products for use in the native language of target countries 
kanji  french  korean  spanish and german versions of chameleon have been developed and are being sold 
further  the company has adopted its software to support computing standards that are unique to these countries  such as the nec pc in japan 
the company will continue to target major european and asian countries for additional sales and marketing activity and to expand the use of its local sales offices and israel subsidiary in the support of its international sales 
while the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the company s products or that the company s distributors will be able to effectively meet that demand 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  currency fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences  repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s results of operations 
customer support the company s domestic support organization consists of an experienced staff of engineers providing support by telephone from the company s facilities in cupertino and san diego  california  nashua  new hampshire  and bellevue  washington 
both telephone support and regular update releases of the software are provided to customers who purchase an annual maintenance agreement 
the sales and the customer support organizations at netmanage work together closely to provide customer satisfaction 
telephone support hours are from am to pm pacific time  complemented by electronic mail  fax and compuserve access service 
international customers are supported by local distributors who are trained by the company and also are supported by company personnel located in haifa  israel and the european and japanese sales offices 
competition the market for the company s products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customers needs and frequent new product introductions 
to maintain or improve its position in this industry  the company must continue to enhance its current products and develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the failure to develop on a timely basis these or other enhancements incorporating new functionality could cause customers to delay purchase of the company s current products and thereby adversely affect the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis  or that such new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
the company competes directly with providers of windows inter networking applications for the tcp ip protocol such as ftp software  ibm  microsoft  novell  and sun microsystems  inc as well as several other companies 
the company also competes with providers of host access software such as attachmate corporation  wall data  inc  hummingbird communications  ltd 
and wrq  inc the inter networking marketplace has also been identified as a key market by several other companies  including netscape communications corporation  oracle corporation and others 
it is imperative that the company s development efforts remain competitive in this marketplace  particularly given that the market is rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to do so 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than the company 
the market for the company s products is characterized by significant price competition and the company anticipates that it will face increasing pricing pressures from current competitors in the future 
moreover  given that there are low barriers to entry into the software market and that the market is rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change  the company believes that competition will persist and intensify in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide products that compare favorably with the products of the company s competitors or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices 
the company has recently experienced price declines for its products  contributing to lower revenues in as compared to prior periods 
any further material reduction in the price of the company s products would negatively affect gross margins as a percentage of net revenues and would require the company to increase software unit sales in order to maintain net revenues at existing levels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
proprietary rights the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under patent  trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the company has received  and may receive in the future  communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties  seeking indemnification against such infringement or indicating that the company may be interested in obtaining a license from such third parties 
there can be no assurance that any of such claims would not result in protracted and costly litigation 
the company believes that  due to the rapid pace of innovation within its industry  factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position within the industry than are the various legal means of protecting its technology 
the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe any existing proprietary rights of others  although there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
employees as of december   the company had a total of full time employees  of whom were engaged in sales  marketing and technical support  in general management  administration and finance  in software development and engineering and in production 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and the company has not experienced any work stoppage 
the company believes that its employee relations are good 
the majority of the company s employee workforce is located in the extremely competitive employment markets of the silicon valley in california and in haifa  israel 
during the latter half of  the company experienced high attrition at all levels and across all functions of the company 
the attrition experienced by the company was attributable to various factors including  among others  industry wide demand exceeding supply for experienced engineering and sales professionals 
the company has and will continue to address the issue of attrition  and in fact in january  repriced the majority of its outstanding stock options in an effort to retain its employees and become competitive in the extremely competitive employment market 
managing employee attrition  integrating acquired operations and products and expanding both the geographic area of its customer base and operations have resulted in substantial demands on the company s management resources 
the company s future operating results will be dependent in part on its ability to attract and retain its employee workforce  train and manage its management and employee base  and continue to implement and improve its operating and financial controls 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage such challenges successfully

such forward looking statements include  among others  statements regarding expected fluctuations in revenues and percentages of revenues from international markets  indirect sales channels and services  and statements regarding expected declines in operating expenses and capital spending 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements

in addition  there is no assurance that the company s organizational changes and plans for will prove successful  that the company s existing products will continue to meet with customer acceptance  that the company will not suffer increased competitive pressures  that corporate buying decisions will not be influenced by the actions of the company s competitors or other market factors  or that the company will return to profitability and growth 
additional factors are identified under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview netmanage  inc the company develops  markets and supports an integrated set of application  server  and development tool software for the microsoft windows  windows  and windows nt platforms 
the company s standards based products provide tcp ip and sna host access  unix access including nfs and x  and activex based development 
the company s products include the chameleon atx family chameleon hostlink  chameleon nfs x  ecco pro  and the z mail messaging family 
its products are sold and serviced worldwide by the company s direct sales force  international subsidiaries  and authorized channel partners 
since the company s inception  revenues from the chameleon family of products have represented substantially all of the company s revenues  and the company expects that revenues from these products will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of maximum information  inc maxinfo  in exchange for shares of the company s common stock 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests during the third quarter of the operations of maxinfo  however  were not material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position and  therefore  the historical financial statements have not been restated to reflect the acquisition retroactively 
accordingly  the operations of maxinfo from the date of acquisition forward have been recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of age logic  inc age in exchange for shares of the company s common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and have been restated to combine the results of age and the company 
the company s financial statements for the year ended december  have not been restated  however  as the results of operations for age were not materially significant to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company also acquired all of the outstanding stock of syzygy communications  inc syzygy  in exchange for shares of the company s common stock  in october this transaction was also accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the operations of syzygy  however  were not material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position and  therefore  the historical financial statements have not been restated to reflect the acquisition retroactively 
accordingly  the operations of syzygy from the date of acquisition forward have been recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of arabesque software  inc arabesque and ariana  sa ariana 
these transactions were accounted for as purchases and the operations of arabesque and ariana from the dates of acquisition forward have been recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the company experienced a significant decline in net revenues and net income during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the decline in net revenues primarily reflects increased competition  pricing pressures and general confusion in the marketplace resulting from rapidly changing technology and product introductions 
in addition  the decline reflects the company s lack of success in marketing and selling its products in the united states and japan in particular  and also reflects the inability to realize any significant revenues from the company s recent acquisitions of products and technology 
operating expenses for included increased costs related to the company s acquisition activity  particularly headcount related costs  and increased costs related to the company s investment in expanding its direct corporate sales and support functions in the united states  neither of which has yet produced the expected results in terms of increased net revenues 
in addition  operating expenses for included a fourth quarter charge of million for the write off of in process research and development in connection with the purchases of technology from applicom software industries ltd 
and us computer software  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating expense levels are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
operating expense growth  coupled with the significant decline in net revenues  resulted in a net loss of million for the year ended december  operating expenses are expected to decline in terms of absolute dollars in the future 
such operating expenses may increase  however  in the future as a percentage of net revenues in the event the company s revenues decline more than its operating expenses 
while the company continues to adjust its operations to address these issues  there can be no assurance that net revenues or net income will stabilize or improve in the future 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  dollars in millions december  change year ended net revenues license fees services total net revenues as a percentage of net revenues license fees services total net revenues gross margin as a percentage of net revenues research and development as a percentage of net revenues sales and marketing as a percentage of net revenues general and administrative as a percentage of net revenues write off of in process research and development as a percentage of net revenues amortization of goodwill as a percentage of net revenues acquisition costs as a percentage of net revenues interest income as a percentage of net revenues equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliate as a percentage of net revenues provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate n a net income loss as a percentage of net revenues n a net revenues historically substantially all of the company s net revenues have been derived from software license fees 
service revenues have been primarily attributable to maintenance agreements associated with licenses 
during the year ended december   however  license fees declined significantly and service revenues increased in absolute dollars year over year by approximately license fees decreased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the decline in license fees was primarily attributable to increased competition  heightened pricing pressures and the general confusion within the marketplace resulting from rapidly changing technology and product introductions  the delayed release of windows nt  and the slow adoption of windows in corporate accounts  all of which contributed to delayed buying decisions  particularly by corporate users 
in addition  the decline reflects the company s lack of success in marketing and selling its products in the united states and japan in particular  and also reflects the inability of the company to realize any significant revenues from its recent acquisitions of products and technology 
these factors may lead to lower unit volumes as well as lower average prices for the foreseeable future 
while the company has been adjusting its operations to address these issues  there can be no assurance that revenues will stabilize or increase in the future 
service revenues increased in absolute dollars year over year by approximately and as a percentage of net revenues increased to nearly of total net revenues 
these increases primarily reflect the company s focus on marketing its customer support services domestically in during mid  the company expanded its worldwide operations with new sales offices internationally in europe and japan 
international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  in particular  the company was unsuccessful in marketing and selling its products in japan  which in and the first half of accounted for the majority of the company s international revenues 
the company has recently addressed and taken steps with respect to staffing and management  distributor relationships  and product marketing in japan  however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its attempts to more successfully market and sell its products in japan in the future 
software license fees are generally recognized as revenue upon shipment if there are no  or insignificant  post delivery obligations  and allowances for returns and doubtful accounts are provided based on historical rates of returns and write offs  which have not been material to date 
certain of the company s sales to distributors are under agreements providing rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise 
accordingly  the company defers recognition of such sales until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
the company provides ongoing maintenance and support to its customers  generally under annual service agreements 
maintenance and support is comprised of software updates for existing products and telephone support 
service revenues are recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of such agreements 
the company expects that service revenues will continue to increase as a percentage of total net revenues 
periodically the company has provided training and consulting services to selected customers 
such revenue is recognized as the related services are performed and has not been material to date 
the company does not expect that revenues generated from such services will become materially significant in the future 
no customer accounted for more than of net revenues during the years ended december  and gross margin cost of revenues primarily includes royalties paid to third parties for licensed software incorporated into the company s products  costs associated with product packaging  documentation and software duplication  and the amortization and writedown of purchased software 
a charge of approximately million is included in cost of revenues for the year ended december  for the amortization and write off of software purchased in early the write off of purchased software primarily resulted from the company s decision during the fourth quarter of to discontinue its chameleonnfs for mac os and xoftware r for mac os product lines 
gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues  declined slightly between the years ended december  and  primarily as a result of the decline in the revenue base and the write off discussed above 
cost of service revenues through december  has not been material and is not reported separately 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues may fluctuate in the future due to increased price competition  the mix of distribution channels used by the company  the mix of license fee revenues versus service revenues  the mix of products sold and the mix of international versus domestic revenues 
the company typically recognizes higher gross margins on direct sales than on sales through indirect channels and higher gross margins on license fee revenues than on service revenues 
research and development research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  occupancy and travel expenses  as well as fees paid to outside consultants

liquidity and capital resources as of december  in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities since the company s inception  growth has been financed primarily through cash provided by operations and sales of capital stock 
the company s primary financing activities to date consist of its initial and secondary stock offerings and preferred stock issuances  and have aggregated net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the company does not have a bank line of credit or an equipment lease facility 
during the year ended december   the company s aggregate cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments decreased from million to million 
this decrease was due primarily to operating losses 
the company s principal investing activities to date have been the purchase of short term and long term investments  purchases of technology  and purchases of property and equipment 
net of proceeds from maturities  the company invested million in short term and long term investments during cash expenditures for purchased technology and the acquisition of a business amounted to million in in addition  expenditures for purchases of property and equipment were million in and were primarily purchases of computers and  to a lesser extent  office equipment

the company and elron have guaranteed a bank line of credit for netvision in the amount of million 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance on this line of credit 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
the company believes that its current cash balances and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company has experienced and expects to experience in future periods significant fluctuations in operating results that may be caused by many factors including  among others  demand for the company s products  introduction or enhancements of products by the company or its competitors  technological changes in computer networking  market acceptance of new products  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  the size and timing of individual orders  mix of international and domestic revenues  mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  seasonality of revenues  quality control of products  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenues shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s operating results and on the company s ability to achieve profitability 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
product development and competition the market for the company s products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customers needs and frequent new product introductions 
particularly over the past year  many customers have delayed purchase decisions due to the confusion in the marketplace relating to rapidly changing technology and product introductions 
to maintain or improve its position in this industry  the company must continue to enhance its current products and to develop  introduce successfully and market new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the failure to develop on a timely basis these or other enhancements incorporating new functionality could cause customers to delay purchase of the company s current products or cause customers to purchase products from the company s competitors  either situation would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis  or that such new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than the company 
the market for the company s products is characterized by significant price competition and the company anticipates that it will face increasing pricing pressures from its current and new competitors in the future 
moreover  given that there are low barriers to entry into the software market and that the market is rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change  the company believes that competition will persist and intensify in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide products that compare favorably with the products of the company s competitors or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices 
the company has recently experienced price declines for its products  contributing to lower revenues 
any further material reduction in the price of the company s products would require the company to increase unit sales in order to maintain revenues at existing levels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
the company s competitors could seek to expand their product offerings by designing and selling products using tcp ip or other technology that could render obsolete or adversely affect sales of the company s products 
for example  microsoft corporation microsoft  a company with significantly greater financial  development and marketing resources  has recently introduced a personal information manager and has included this product in a suite of software 
this development may adversely affect the company s sales of its own products either by directly affecting customer purchasing decisions or by causing potential customers to delay their purchases of the company s products 
substantially all of the company s net revenues have been derived from the sales of products that provide inter networking applications for the microsoft windows environment and are marketed primarily to windows users 
as a result  sales of the company s products would be materially adversely affected by market developments adverse to windows 
in addition  the company s strategy of developing products based on the windows operating environment is substantially dependent on its ability to gain pre release access to  and to develop expertise in  current and future windows developments by microsoft 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to provide on a timely basis products compatible with future window releases 
marketing and distribution as part of its strategy to develop multiple distribution channels  the company expects to increase its use of resellers  particularly value added resellers and system integrators  in addition to distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
the company expects that indirect sales will grow as a percentage of both domestic and total revenues and that any material increase in the company s indirect sales as a percentage of revenues will adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit costs that are typically charged when selling through indirect channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract resellers and distributors who will be able to market the company s products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
the company ships products to resellers and distributors on a purchase order basis  and many of the company s resellers and distributors carry competing product lines 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any reseller or distributor will continue to represent the company s products  and the inability to recruit or retain important resellers or distributors could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
global market risks the company derived approximately of net revenues from international sales during the year ended december  while the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the company s products or that the company s distributors will be able to effectively meet that demand 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  currency fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences  repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s results of operations 
employee retention the majority of the company s employee workforce is located in the extremely competitive employment markets of the silicon valley in california and in haifa  israel 
during the latter half of  the company experienced high attrition at all levels and across all functions of the company 
the attrition experienced by the company was attributable to various factors including  among others  industry wide demand exceeding supply for experienced engineering and sales professionals 
the company has and will continue to address the issue of attrition  and in fact in january  repriced the majority of its outstanding stock options in an effort to retain its employees and become competitive in the extremely competitive employment market 
managing employee attrition  integrating acquired operations and products and expanding both the geographic area of its customer base and operations have resulted in substantial demands on the company s management resources 
the company s future operating results will be dependent in part on its ability to attract and retain its employee workforce  train and manage its management and employee base  and continue to implement and improve its operating and financial controls 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage such challenges successfully 
other the company regularly evaluates product and technology acquisition opportunities and anticipates that it may make additional acquisitions in the future 
product and technology acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products  diversion of management s attention away from day to day matters and potential loss of key employees from acquired companies 
to date  the company s acquisitions have not contributed significantly to revenues  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate successfully the operations and personnel acquired to date  and if applicable  in the future 
the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
quarterly financial information the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly financial information for the company s last eight quarters 
the company s consolidated financial results were restated for the year ended december  to include the combined operating results of age and the company  as previously described 
this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
the company has experienced and expects to experience in future periods significant fluctuations in operating results that may be caused by many factors  including  among others  those described above within factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the company s future revenues and results of operations could be subject to significant volatility and may also be unpredictable due to shipment patterns typical of the software industry 
a significant percentage of the company s revenues are generally expected to be recognized in the third month of each quarter and may tend to occur in the latter half of that month 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
