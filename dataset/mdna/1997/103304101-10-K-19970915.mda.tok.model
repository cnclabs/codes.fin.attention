as of june  and  the company had balances of cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million  respectively  and working capital deficits of million and million  respectively 
the company has historically operated with negative working capital in order to minimize borrowings and related interest costs under its bank credit facility 
the working capital deficits are funded through cash generated from operations as well as borrowings under the bank credit facility

however  the unused availability was subsequently reduced in july in connection with the issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes described below

see investment considerations leverage and debt service  expansion  and additional financing requirements 
the company continues to pursue and investigate additional expansion opportunities both in nevada and in other markets where casino gaming is currently permitted 
such expansion will be affected and determined by several key factors  including license selection processes  identification of additional suitable investment opportunities in current gaming jurisdictions  and availability of acceptable financing 
additional projects will require the company to make substantial investments  which the company intends to fund through cash flow from operations and availability under the bank credit facility 
to the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient  the company may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity and or debt financings or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company and its stockholders
