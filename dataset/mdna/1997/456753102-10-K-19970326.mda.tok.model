item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
this report includes forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements 
see other factors that may affect operating results for a discussion of such factors  among others  which could cause actual results to differ materially 
results of operations net revenues the company had net revenues of in compared to million for  a decrease of 
net revenues in increased from million for the decrease in net revenues for reflects softness in the consumer market for the company s products throughout the entire year compared to the strong demand experienced in the consumer market both in and in the consumer market accounted for about million of net revenues in compared to about million in and million in the communications market grew to about million in compared to about million in and million in the growth in net revenues in both and reflected increased volume of chipcorder products sold both into the communications market and the consumer market 
in  volume continued to increase in the communications market but decreased significantly in the consumer market 
the company reduced prices on all existing isd products during the year as explained in the gross margin section below 
as the company s products mature  their average selling prices tend to decline 
sales by market segment for were communications  consumer and industrial compared to communications  consumer and industrial for and communications  consumer and industrial for the company s communications customers in continued representing such products as telephone answering machines  cellular phones  personal handy phones and pagers 
products for consumer customers in consisted primarily of personal memory recorders  cameras  photo frames  books  educational toys and novelties 
sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for of net revenues in compared to in and in the top five customers in were motorola  marubun the company s japanese distributor  sanyo  yes entertainment and sequoia the company s united kingdom distributor  accounting for     and of net revenues  respectively 
the company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company has also experienced significant changes in the composition of its major customer base from year to year and expects this pattern to continue as certain customers  particularly those that design and sell novelty products in the consumer market  increase or decrease their purchases of the company s products as a result of fluctuations in market demand for such customer s products 
the loss of  or significant reduction in purchases by  current major customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s customers typically do not contract for minimum purchase quantities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain the orders from new customers necessary to offset any losses of or reductions in purchases by the company s current major customers 
export sales for were compared to in and in geographically  sales to asia were in compared to in and in  and sales to europe increased to in from in and in japan accounted for of total sales in versus a year earlier and in north american sales were in  in  and in the company is subject to the risk of conducting business internationally  including foreign government regulation and general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  certain of the company s sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on unsold products 
accordingly  the company defers recognition of such sales until the product is sold by the distributor 
gross margin gross margin decreased to in compared to in and in the decrease in was caused by the reduction in average selling prices while product costs were not reduced as originally planned because of the delay with the conversion to the smaller and less costly micron process 
this conversion had been planned for completion by the end of the first quarter of  but  because of process difficulties  the conversion was delayed and not completed until the beginning of the fourth quarter of the higher gross margin realized in came as a result of reduced manufacturing costs  yield improvements and the conversion to smaller micron from micron geometry processes for the majority of products shipped during that year 
the company expects to continue to experience declines in its average selling prices  which could adversely affect gross margins  particularly if higher yields and reduced costs are not achieved 
additionally  the company expects that it could experience variations in gross margins as a result of shifts in product and customer mix 
research and development research and development r d expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in r d expenditures as a percent of net revenues were in compared to in and in this increase in expenditures was caused by continued investment in the development of new products and by costs associated with bringing up new technologies and new foundries 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars 
there can be no assurance that new products will be successfully developed or will achieve market acceptance 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including recognition of market requirements  product cost  timely completion or acquisition and introduction of new product designs  quality of new products and achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields from the company s subcontractor manufacturers 
because of the design complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays from time to time in completing development and introduction of new products  and there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter such delays in the development and introduction of future products 
the failure of the company s new product development efforts or market acceptance of such products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
selling  general and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a increased in to million from million in and million in sg a expenses as a percent of net revenues grew to in compared to in and in the growth in sg a expenses in came from the addition of staff to marketing and sales as well as increased marketing investments  including the cost of advertising  participation in trade shows  several direct mailers  and additional sales collateral 
the growth in sg a expenses in came from additional legal  accounting and insurance expense incurred in the first year as a public company  legal expenses incurred in connection with the atmel litigation matter  and increased commission expense corresponding to increased revenue 
the company anticipates that sg a expenses will continue to increase in total expenses but will decrease as a percentage of net revenues 
other income expense net interest and other income was million for compared to million for  and net interest and other expense of  in the interest income in and was earned primarily from the investment of the proceeds from the initial public offering in february and the follow on offering in september provision for income taxes for fiscal  the company recorded a tax benefit of million  reflecting the carryback of losses to prior years 
the company s effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the provision for and reflects the utilization of federal and state net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards 
at december   the company had established a valuation allowance against their gross deferred tax asset of  the valuation allowance was established due to the company s limited history of profitability  limitations on the utilization of nol carryforwards  which are restricted in use under the internal revenue code of see note of notes to financial statements and uncertainties regarding future operations due to the increased competition within the company s industry 
liquidity and capital resources in february  the company received net proceeds of approximately million in its initial public offering and  in september  the company received net proceeds of approximately million in a follow on public common stock offering 
the company has a line of credit with a commercial bank under which the company may borrow up to million based on eligible accounts receivable and million based on eligible investments  with a term through june  at december   the company s borrowing base was approximately million and there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
the company s operating activities used net cash of million in and provided net cash of million in and million net cash used for operations in was primarily the result of the company s loss for the year 
in and the cash provided by operations was primarily the result of the company s net income in each of those years 
cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to cash used of million and million in and  respectively 
in and  investing activities consisted principally of the purchase and maturity of investments 
cash used for financing activities was million in and 
million in financing activities in primarily consisted of the repurchase of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily resulting from the sale of common and preferred stock 
in january  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to one million shares of common shares 
in addition  in july  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan of an additional  shares of common stock 
as of december  the company had repurchased  shares at an average price of per share 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
the company believes cash generated from operations  its existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and its available line of credit and current equipment lease lines will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
from time to time  the company has evaluated and will continue to evaluate possible business acquisitions 
other factors that may affect future operating results this report includes forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a variety of factors 
the following includes a discussion of factors that  among other factors  could cause actual results to differ materially 
all of the company s products are manufactured by two independent foundries 
the company s primary supplier is currently samsung electronics co  ltd 
samsung in korea 
the company also uses sanyo electric co  ltd 
sanyo to manufacture a customized product using the process technology of atmel corporation atmel 
sanyo purchases all of its production of this product for its own use or for distribution to its customers 
the company depends on these foundries to allocate to the company a portion of their foundry capacity sufficient to meet the company s needs  to produce products of high quality with acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver products to the company on time 
on occasion  the company has experienced difficulties in each of these areas  and the company is likely to experience such difficulties in the future 
the company has qualified another foundry supplier  rohm co  ltd 
and is in the process of finalizing the design for the first product 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will receive its desired allocation of product at these foundries or that additional needed foundry capacity will be qualified 
the loss of sanyo or samsung as a supplier  the inability of the company to maintain or expand foundry capacity from its current suppliers or to qualify other wafer manufacturers so the company can obtain additional foundry capacity  any inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from the company s current or future suppliers or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply could constrain  interrupt or delay shipments of the company s products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s reliance on third party manufacturers also involves a number of additional risks  including but not limited to reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
on june   atmel filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california which alleges causes of action against the company for patent infringement  trade secret misappropriation  breach of written contract  breach of contract implied in fact  unjust enrichment and declaratory relief 
atmel  in addition to damages and injunctive relief  is seeking a declaration from the court that atmel is a co owner of the company s chipcorder products 
in january  atmel notified the company and samsung of certain claims and demanded that the company and samsung either negotiate licenses with atmel or cease manufacturing chipcorder products at samsung 
prior to its february initial public offering  the company received an opinion from its patent counsel that the company does not violate any of the patents identified in atmel s notice to the company  and the company believes the patent claims are without merit 
the company also believes that the other claims in the notice from atmel were without merit  and its general counsel  on january   after reviewing with appropriate senior and knowledgeable personnel at the company the factual information surrounding the other claims  provided  a written response to atmel that these claims were without merit 
all the causes of action alleged in the complaint appear to be based on the same circumstances alleged in the january atmel notice 
the company believes the causes of action in the complaint to be without merit and has had its general counsel file an answer denying any wrongful conduct and asserting counterclaims for damage caused the company by atmel s termination of the fabrication arrangement between the parties 
while the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material impact on its business or financial position  it may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 
the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a highly controlled  clean environment 
as a result  the company has experienced problems in achieving an acceptable wafer manufacturing yield the number of good die per wafer 
the company is particularly susceptible to yield problems because it is not in direct control of the independent offshore foundries that manufacture its products  which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
in addition  in order to reduce future manufacturing costs and remain competitive  the company is continually designing smaller die sizes with smaller geometry processes to increase the number of die produced on each wafer 
problems with future transitions of this type could cause disruptions in the manufacturing flow and reduce manufacturing yields 
the inability of the company to achieve improved yields could prevent revenue growth from existing capacity and could delay margin improvements 
there can be no assurance that the company s foundries will achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future or that sudden declines in yields will not again occur 
failures to improve  or fluctuations in  manufacturing yields  particularly at times when the company is experiencing severe pricing pressures from its customers or its competitors  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the development of new applications for voice recording and playback in the consumer  communications and industrial markets 
for example  motorola uses one of the company s products to add a record and playback feature to its microtac elite cellular phones 
if the market for microtac elite phones fails to develop as expected  the company s sales would be negatively impacted 
furthermore  the company expects that it may sell many of its new products  including products with longer recording durations now under development  to customers that are developing new product applications and markets 
accordingly  the success of the company will depend upon the success of its customers in developing such applications and markets 
there can be no assurance that new applications or markets will develop as expected by the company or that prospective customers developing products for any such markets will design the company s products into their products and successfully introduce such products 
the failure of new applications or markets to develop or the failure of new markets to be receptive to the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the willingness of prospective customers to design the company s products into their products depends to a significant extent upon the ability of the company to price its products at a level that is cost effective for such customers 
the markets for most of the potential applications for the company s products  particularly the consumer market  are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for the company s products develop and competition increases  the company anticipates that its average selling prices on these products will continue to decline  particularly as product technology matures and if per order unit volumes for such products increase 
these and other downward pressures on the company s average selling prices will require the company to seek sales in emerging markets where average selling prices may be higher and to produce its products at lower cost if it is to avoid significant degradation in its gross margins 
to the extent that the company fails to facilitate its customers opening of new markets  experiences yield or other production problems or shortages in supply that increase its manufacturing costs  or fails to reduce its manufacturing costs  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company relies on a combination of patents  mask work protection  trademarks  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged and invalidated  that patents will issue from any of the company s pending applications or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued in all countries where the company s products can be sold to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
competitors of the company also may be able to design around the company s patents 
in addition  parties might have or obtain patents or other exclusive proprietary rights that would potentially limit the number of possible customers for the company s products for certain applications 
any such limitations in the company s potential markets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
finally  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s products more likely 
all of the above factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors can materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected
