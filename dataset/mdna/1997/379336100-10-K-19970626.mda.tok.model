item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
although the company has been expanding its international operations  of the company s revenues in fiscal and in fiscal were derived from work performed in the gulf of mexico 
the offshore marine construction industry in the gulf of mexico is highly seasonal as a result of weather conditions and the timing of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
historically  a substantial portion of the company s services has been performed during the period from june through november 
as a result  a disproportionate portion of the company s revenues  gross profit and net income generally is earned during the second july through september and third october through december quarters of its fiscal year 
because of seasonality  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
the following table documents the seasonal nature of the company s operations by presenting the percentage of annual revenues  gross profit and net income contributed during each fiscal quarter for the past three fiscal years and the three year weighted average for such periods

 march  revenues fiscal fiscal fiscal three year average gross profit fiscal fiscal fiscal three year average net income fiscal fiscal fiscal three year average the company expanded its operations offshore west africa during the first half of fiscal strong demand for the company s offshore construction services in this market during the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in the fourth quarter of fiscal and making a significantly greater contribution to fiscal and revenues  gross profit and net income than historically  which had a significant impact on the three year weighted averages shown above 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the company s results of operations reflect the level of offshore construction activity in the gulf of mexico for all years and offshore west africa during fiscal and  and in asia pacific for the last quarter of fiscal  and the company s ability to win jobs through competitive bidding and manage won jobs to successful completion 
the level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by three factors first  the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves on production  second  the oil and gas industry s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and third  weather events such as major hurricanes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for fiscal of million were higher than fiscal revenues of million  with strong contributions from international operations  diving  liftboats  derrick services and coastal pipelay 
revenues from west africa improved to million  up from million in months of fiscal in the gulf of mexico  pipeline construction activity increased from the prior year  and  largely due to the addition of coastal pipeline services and the norman offshore pipelines  inc acquisition  barge days employed improved  from  days in fiscal to  days in fiscal competition continued to intensify as additional barges relocated to and competed for pipeline installation projects 
liftboat and dsv days employed in fiscal of  days were significantly higher than the  days employed in fiscal  as a result of increased activity and the addition of two dsv s and two liftboats during the year 
diver days employed improved  from  days in fiscal to  days in fiscal  as higher activity was combined with additional days resulting from the norman and divcon acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of drydocking costs  for fiscal was million compared to the million recorded in fiscal the increase of was principally attributable to depreciation on the cheyenne and the hercules both of which are depreciated on a units of production basis  and higher dry dock amortization amounts 
gross profit 
gross profit  the excess of revenues over the cost of revenues  including depreciation and amortization charges  for fiscal of million was higher than the million reported for fiscal expressed as a percentage of revenues  gross profit in fiscal of was the same as that reported in fiscal  as improved margins from higher activity levels were offset by the cost burden of building the operating infrastructure to support additions to the operating fleet and by lower margins on fabrication and procurement portions of turnkey contracts in west africa 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
while selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million were higher than the million reported in fiscal  as a percentage of revenues it decreased to from

interest expense and other income and expense 
interest expense was million net of capitalized interest in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal other income in fiscal of million was comparable to the million reported in fiscal the changes in interest expense and interest income occurred as heavy capital expenditures in fiscal reduced the surplus funds available for short term investments during part of the year  while the net proceeds of an equity offering completed in february added to surplus funds available for the remainder of the year

the company s effective tax rate for fiscal remains substantially consistent with fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for fiscal of million were higher than fiscal revenues of million  as revenues contributed from international expansion of offshore construction services  a full year of operations of the liftboats and turnkey project revenues more than offset the decline in gulf of mexico pipeline construction activity 
early in fiscal  the company converted the db derrick barge into a combination pipelay derrick barge  now named the cheyenne  and entered the offshore west africa construction area 
this commitment produced positive results as or of the  total barge days worked in fiscal were offshore west africa 
in the gulf of mexico  pipeline construction activity declined from the prior year and competition intensified as additional barges relocated to and competed in this area 
as a result  barge days employed in the gulf of mexico market declined  from  days in fiscal to  days in fiscal liftboat and dsv days employed in fiscal of  days were significantly higher than the  days employed in fiscal  as a result of inclusion of a full year of operation of the sixteen liftboats acquired effective december  diver days employed declined only  from  days in fiscal to  days in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of drydocking costs  for fiscal was million compared to the million recorded in fiscal the increase of was principally the result of increased depreciation attributable to capital expenditures to acquire the sixteen liftboats  conversion of the db into the combination barge cheyenne  and increased use of the upgraded chickasaw in the dynamic positioning mode of operation and the converted sea lion previously called global diver  partially offset by less barge days employed in the gulf of mexico 
gross profit 
gross profit  the excess of revenues over the cost of revenues  including depreciation and amortization charges  for fiscal of million was higher than the million reported for fiscal expressed as a percentage of revenues  gross profit in fiscal of was lower than the reported in fiscal  largely because of the competitive gulf of mexico offshore construction and the cost burden of building the operating infrastructure to support additions to the operating fleet the heavy lift barge hercules in late november and the combination barge mohawk and the pioneer  in the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
while selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million were higher than the million reported in fiscal  as a percentage of revenues it increased only to from

fiscal operating results include a million provision relating to the company s incentive compensation and employee retirement plan compared with a provision in fiscal of million 
of the provision  million was charged to cost of revenues and million included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the fiscal provision was charged million to cost of revenues and million to selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense and other income and expense 
interest expense was million in both fiscal and other income and expense in fiscal of million was lower than the million reported in fiscal because heavy capital expenditures in fiscal reduced the surplus funds available for short term investments and the prior year included an million gain from the sale of non essential land and buildings at the port of iberia  new iberia  louisiana 
net income 
net income for fiscal of million was higher than the million recorded for fiscal  while net income per share of increased from fiscal net income per share of as average shares outstanding increased
