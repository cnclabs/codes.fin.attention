excluding significant items and extraordinary loss 
as shown above  excluding the significant items  the company s net earnings would have been million per share in  as compared to million per share in and million 
per share in the resulting increase in net earnings in  compared to  was primarily attributable to improvements within the company s refining and marketing and marine services segments  each of which reported significant improvements from the prior year 
results from the company s exploration and production segment increased  even when excluding the above items and removing the incremental value of an above market pricing contract see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item from both and additionally  at the corporate level  initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of helped reduce general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in the company s total effective tax rate in as earnings subject to us taxes exceeded available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
when comparing to  the improvement in net earnings of approximately million was primarily attributable to increased natural gas production from the company s exploration and production operations in south texas and improvements in the company s refining and marketing operations 
in  dividend requirements on preferred stock amounted to million see note k of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to these results are presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  together with the following information  are intended to provide shareholders and other investors with a reasonable basis for assessing the company s operations  but should not serve as the sole criterion for predicting the future performance of the company 
the company conducts its operations in the following business segments refining and marketing  exploration and production  and marine services

sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refinery  products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties 
the company s purchases of refined products for resale were approximately   and  average daily barrels for  and  respectively 
margins on sales of purchased products  together with the effect of changes in inventories  are included in the gross margin on total product sales 
computations of average costs of sales per barrel in exclude the benefits of an million tariff refund and million favorable feedstock cost adjustments 
compared to results from the company s refining and marketing segment improved during with operating profit of million  compared to operating profit of 
million in this improvement was achieved during a year when the industry was facing rapidly rising prices in the crude oil market 
in addition  the company s production level at the refinery was reduced in september for a scheduled day maintenance downtime 
despite these factors  the company was able to achieve a refinery product spread of per barrel for  compared to per barrel in the company s results were helped by its initiatives to control costs  improve its refinery product slate and expand the marketing program for its refined products 
the company s refined product yield values increased by to per barrel in  from per barrel in  while the company s feedstock costs increased by to per barrel in from per barrel in during  the company s production of refined products declined in total by  which included the impact of the scheduled maintenance period 
of this decline  gasoline production decreased by and middle distillates  consisting of jet fuel and diesel fuel  decreased by only 
these reductions reflected the change of a hydrocracker catalyst  during the maintenance period  which allows for increased production of jet fuel and reduced production of gasoline  beginning in the fourth quarter of  which better matches the company s product supply with demand in alaska 
to further improve the refinery s feedstock and product slate  the company intends to modify the refinery hydrocracker during  at an estimated cost of million 
in conjunction with the modification and other initiatives  a refinery downtime of approximately days is anticipated during the company continued its marketing efforts during  adding locations in alaska and locations in the pacific northwest  bringing the total to branded  unbranded and company owned retail outlets in alaska and branded stations in the pacific northwest 
two uneconomic outlets in these areas were closed in in addition  the company began producing and marketing liquid asphalt  a heavy product remaining after the refining process  which is a seasonal product in alaska 
export sales of refined products  including sales to the russian far east  amounted to million in and million in revenues from sales of refined products in the company s refining and marketing segment decreased in due primarily to a decline in sales volumes  partially offset by a increase in average sales prices 
total refined product sales averaged  barrels per day in as compared to  barrels per day in this decline reflected the lower production volumes and the company s withdrawal from certain west coast markets during  which also reduced the company s purchases from other refiners and suppliers to  barrels per day in as compared to  barrels per day in the company plans to sell its company owned facilities in california 
one of these facilities was sold in resulting in a loss of 
million  two facilities remain for sale at year end the company at times resells previously purchased crude oil  sales of which increased to million in  compared to million in  due primarily to higher crude oil prices and in part due to sales of excess crude supply volumes during the maintenance period 
costs of sales decreased in due to lower volumes of refined products  partially offset by higher prices for crude oil and refined products 
operating expenses were higher in due primarily to higher environmental and employee costs partially offset by lower insurance costs 
although results from the company s refining and marketing segment for improved over levels  future profitability of this segment will continue to be significantly influenced by market conditions  particularly as these conditions influence costs of crude oil relative to prices received for sales of refined products  and other additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
compared to the refining and marketing s segment operating profit of 
million in decreased million from operating profit of million in results for benefited from an million refund received in settlement of a tariff dispute  a gain of million from the sale of assets and favorable feedstock cost adjustments of million  partially offset by million for environmental contingencies and other matters 
excluding these items from  operating profit in reflected an improvement of million from the operating results 
the company s average feedstock costs increased by  to per barrel in from per barrel in  while the average yield value of the company s refinery production increased by only  to per barrel in from per barrel in increased demand for alaska north slope ans crude oil for use as a feedstock in west coast refineries and declining production volumes of ans  combined with an oversupply of products in alaska and on the west coast  resulted in higher feedstock costs for the company relative to increases in refined product sales prices 
as a result  the company s refined product margins were depressed in the start up in december of a vacuum unit at the company s refinery increased the yield of higher valued products during and lessened the impact of these industry conditions on the company s refinery spread 
the company s refinery yield of residual products was reduced to of total production in from of total production in in addition  margins on sales of inventories and purchased volumes combined to improve the segment s gross margins on total product sales to per barrel in  compared to per barrel in the company s total refinery production increased by  including a increase in gasoline volumes and a increase in middle distillates volumes 
accordingly  in  the company implemented initiatives that increased the demand for the refinery s production and improved the refinery s capacity utilization and efficiencies 
in these regards  the company expanded its marketing efforts by branding and rebranding sales outlets in alaska and the pacific northwest and by exporting refined products to the far east  including russia 
revenues from export sales totaled million in compared to million in the company s total product sales increased to  average barrels per day in from  average barrels per day in revenues from sales of refined products in were higher than in due to higher sales prices and the increase in sales volumes 
resales of crude oil aggregated million in and million in costs of sales were higher in due to higher volumes and prices 
operating expenses decreased by million in primarily due to lower environmental costs  partly offset by increased employee costs and fuels and utilities expense

exploration and production united states compared to operating profit of million from the company s us oil and gas operations in increased million from operating profit of million in comparability between these years was impacted by several major transactions in  which will also impact future results of operations 
these transactions included the favorable resolution in august of litigation with tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee gas regarding a natural gas purchase and sales contract tennessee gas contract and the termination of the remainder of such contract in december as provided for in the tennessee gas contract  which was to expire in january  the company was selling a portion of the gas produced in the bob west field pursuant to a contract price contract price  which was above the average spot market price 
in total  during the company received approximately million in cash for the resolution of litigation and termination of the tennessee gas contract  with the company s exploration and production segment recording operating profit of million for the termination of the contract effective october  results of operations in future years will no longer benefit from the above market pricing provisions of the tennessee gas contract 
in  and  the exploration and production segment s operating profit also included million  million and million  respectively  from the excess of tennessee gas contract prices over spot market prices 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item and capital resources and liquidity discussed below 
additionally  during  substantially all of the company s proved producing reserves in the bob west field were certified by the texas railroad commission as high cost gas from a designated tight formation  eligible for state severance tax exemptions from the date of first production through august accordingly  no severance tax is recorded on current production from exempt wells beginning in and the company recognized income of million for retroactive refunds for production in prior years 
operating profit for included a gain of million from the sale of certain interests in the bob west field see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
excluding these significant transactions and the impact of the incremental contract value from both years  operating profit from the company s us oil and gas operations for would have been million compared to million for this resulting increase was primarily due to higher spot market prices for sales of natural gas  as industry demand increased due to unusually cold weather combined with below normal storage levels 
prices realized by the company on its spot natural gas production increased to per mcf in from per mcf in excluding  mcf per day related to the sold interests from  the company s spot production increased by  mcf per day 
the company s exploration and acquisition programs outside of the bob west field contributed  mcf per day of the increase in spot production with the remaining increase attributable to sales to tennessee gas at spot prices effective october  the company s weighted average sales price  which included the above market pricing of the tennessee gas contract through october   increased to per mcf in as compared to per mcf in for the bob west field  production declined by  mcf per day after excluding amounts related to sold interests in gross operating revenues from the company s us oil and gas operations  after excluding million related to the sold interests from and excluding price agreements discussed below  decreased by million due primarily to the decline in volumes sold under the tennessee gas contract  partially offset by increases in spot market sales prices and production 
the decline in production costs of million  or 
per mcf  was mainly attributable to the severance tax exemptions in the bob west field 
total depreciation  depletion and amortization was lower in due to lower production volumes  partially offset by a higher depletion rate 
the company enters into commodity price agreements to reduce the risk caused by fluctuation in the prices of natural gas in the spot market 
during and  the company used such agreements to set the price of and  respectively  of the natural gas production that it sold in the spot market 
the company recognized a loss of million 
per mcf in and a gain of 
million 
per mcf in related to these price agreements 
as of january   the company had entered into price agreements for production totaling 
bcf of gas for an average houston ship channel price of per mcf 
in addition  the company has entered into price agreements with collars  under which no payment will be made by either party unless the price falls below a designated floor price or above a designated ceiling price  at which time the company receives or pays the difference  respectively 
the company has entered into price agreements with collars for production totaling bcf of gas with an average houston ship channel floor price of per mcf and a ceiling price of per mcf 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further information on the price agreements 
in addition to the natural gas and oil producing activities  the company s results included revenues of million and operating profit of million in for transportation of natural gas to common carrier pipelines in the south texas area  of which approximately relates to transportation of the company s production 
these amounts were relatively unchanged from the prior year 
compared to operating profit of million in from the company s us oil and gas operations included a gain of approximately million from the sale of certain interests in the bob west field 
excluding this gain  operating profit from these operations would have been approximately million in compared with million in  reflecting a continued successful drilling program which resulted in an increase in the company s us natural gas production in south texas 
after the sale of certain bob west field interests in september  which included interests in gross producing wells  the number of wells in which the company had an interest was reduced to at year end  compared with producing wells at year end the company s us natural gas production sold into the spot market increased by and production sold under the tennessee gas contract increased by 
revenues increased by million due to these increases in production  but were partially offset by lower spot market natural gas sales prices 
the company s weighted average sales price decreased to per mcf during from per mcf in  reflecting lower spot market sales prices and a lower percentage of production sold to tennessee gas at above market prices 
in  approximately of the company s total us production was sold to tennessee gas  compared to in and in total production costs and other operating expenses were higher in due to the increased production levels and severance taxes related to the above market pricing of sales to tennessee gas  but were relatively unchanged on a per mcf basis 
the impact of the increased production volumes on depletion expense was substantially offset by a reduction in the depletion rate which resulted from additions to proved reserves during the year and elimination of proportionately higher future development costs on the reserves sold in the bob west field 
in  operating results from the exploration and production segment included natural gas production of approximately mmcf per day  revenues of million and operating profit of million related to the interests that were sold in the bob west field 
operating results from the company s natural gas transportation operations increased by million in due to higher transmission volumes associated with the increased production levels in south texas 
transportation of the company s production accounted for approximately and of these results in and  respectively 
exploration and production bolivia compared to operating profit from the company s bolivian operations increased to million in  from the million operating profit in this improvement was primarily due to a increase in production of natural gas together with higher prices received for both natural gas and condensate 
during the second and third quarters of  the company benefited from increased demand from the bolivian state owned oil and gas company for higher quality natural gas  in order to meet contract specifications for exports to argentina  together with the inability of another producer to meet supply requirements 
total operating expenses declined by on a per unit basis reflecting a decrease in costs combined with the increase in volumes 
partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization of million 
in  a new hydrocarbons law was passed by the bolivian government that significantly impacts the company s operations in bolivia 
the new law  among other matters  granted the company the option to convert its contracts of operation to new shared risk contracts 
during  the company signed agreements to convert its contracts of operation to shared risk contracts subject to recision at the option of the company if the company is not satisfied with modifications to the bolivian fiscal law 
the company expects to complete this conversion during the first half of the new contracts extend the company s term of operation  provide more favorable acreage relinquishment terms and provide for a more favorable fiscal regime of royalties and taxes 
the new contracts will extend the term of the company s operations for block ten additional years to the year for block  the new contract extends the company s term additional years to the year for acreage that is in the exploration phase of the contract  and ten additional years to the year for an area within block that is designated as being in the development phase of the new contract 
the new contract provisions  along with a substantial discovery during  significantly increased the company s reserves see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
the company s bolivian natural gas production is sold to yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos ypfb  which in turn sells the natural gas to yacimientos petroliferos fiscales  sa ypf  a publicly held company based in argentina 
during  the contract between ypfb and ypf was extended through march   maintaining approximately the same volumes as the previous contract 
ypfb and ypf are currently negotiating a new two year contract through march currently  the company is selling its natural gas production to ypfb based on the volume and pricing terms in the contract between ypfb and ypf 
compared to in  operating profit from the company s bolivian operations decreased by million  reflecting a decrease in net natural gas production 
during  the company had benefited from higher levels of production due to the inability of another producer to satisfy gas supply requirements 
partially offsetting the decrease in production in were increases in the average prices of natural gas and condensate production 
marine services dollars in millions gross operating revenues fuels  lubricants and other services gross operating revenues operating profit gross profit operating and other expenses depreciation and amortization 

operating profit loss capital expenditures excluding acquisitions 

fuel sales  primarily diesel millions of gallons number of terminals compared to on february   the company acquired coastwide energy services  inc coastwide and combined these operations with the company s marine petroleum products distribution business  forming a marine services segment 
as a combined operation  the marine services segment is a marketer and distributor of diesel fuel and lubricants and a provider of logistical services to the offshore exploration and production industry in the gulf of mexico 
operating results from coastwide have been included in the company s marine services segment since the date of acquisition 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements in item the marine services segment currently consists of terminals  compared to at the prior year end 
the added locations and associated volumes  mainly related to the coastwide acquisition  combined with higher fuel prices have contributed to an increase of million in fuels and lubricants revenues 
in addition  revenues from services has grown by million 
these increases in revenues together with improved margins during were partially offset by higher operating and other expenses associated with the increased activity 
depreciation and amortization increased during due to capital additions during the year 
in total  results for the marine services segment reflected a turnaround from the losses incurred in the prior year with operating profit of million for the marine services segment s business is largely dependent upon the volume of oil and gas drilling  workover  construction and seismic activity in the gulf of mexico 
during  and  wells drilled in the gulf of mexico totaled   and  respectively 
compared to in  the company consolidated certain operations by exiting the land based portion of its petroleum product distribution business  reducing the total number of company sites to  primarily marine based  at year end 
in these regards  four texas locations were sold in included in operating and other expenses in was a charge of 
million related to employee terminations and other exit costs 
revenues and costs of sales were lower in due to reduced volumes while these operations were being consolidated 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses of million in compare with million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to lower employee and labor costs resulting from cost reduction measures implemented by the company in late when comparing to  the increase was primarily due to higher employee and other benefits costs 
interest expense and interest income interest expense of million in compares with million in and million in the company s redemption of public debt of million in november and million in december contributed to interest expense savings of million in  equating to future interest savings of approximately million annually 
the increase in  compared to  was primarily due to interest on the refinery vacuum unit financing and cash borrowings under the corporate revolving credit facility during and interest capitalized in related to the construction of the vacuum unit 
in september  the company received and recorded interest income of approximately million from tennessee gas in conjunction with the collection of a receivable that resulted from underpayment for natural gas sold in prior periods see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
other expense other expense of million in compares with million in and million in the increase in included costs of million related to a shareholder consent solicitation which was resolved in april together with a write off of deferred financing costs and higher environmental and other costs related to the company s former operations  partially offset by lower employee termination and restructuring costs 
the increase in  compared with  was primarily due to severance costs and related benefits of million resulting from a reduction in administrative workforce and other employee terminations see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements in item  partially offset by lower environmental and other expenses related to the company s former operations 
income taxes income taxes of million in compare with million in and million in the company s effective tax rate increased to in  compared to a effective rate in  due to earnings subject to us taxes in exceeding available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the decrease in income taxes in  compared with  was primarily due to lower state income taxes 
impact of changing prices the company s operating results and cash flows are sensitive to volatile changes in energy prices 
major shifts in the cost of crude oil used for refinery feedstocks and the price of refined products can result in a change in gross margin from the refining and marketing operations  as prices received for refined products may or may not keep pace with changes in crude oil costs 
these energy prices  together with volume levels  also determine the carrying value of crude oil and refined product inventory 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories of crude oil and us wholesale refined products 
this method results in inventory carrying amounts that are less likely to represent current values and in costs of sales which more closely represent current costs 
likewise  changes in natural gas prices impact revenues and the present value of estimated future net revenues and cash flows from the company s exploration and production operations 
the company may increase or decrease its natural gas production in response to market conditions 
the carrying value of oil and gas assets may be subject to noncash writedowns based on changes in natural gas prices and other determining factors 
changes in natural gas prices also influence the level of drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
the company s marine services operation  whose customers include offshore drilling contractors and related industries  could be impacted by significant fluctuations in natural gas prices 
capital resources and liquidity overview the company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents  internal cash generation and external financing 
during  these sources were significantly enhanced with the i receipt of million for the favorable resolution of the tennessee gas litigation in august and ii the receipt of million for the termination of the tennessee gas contract effective october  see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
although the resolution of the litigation and termination of the remainder of the tennessee gas contract will cause a decrease in the company s average natural gas sales prices in future years  it removed a major financial uncertainty from the company s capital structure  which improves the predictability of the company s cash flows  provides for additional financial flexibility  and allows the company to focus on growth initiatives 
furthermore  during  the company achieved improvement in profitability from all of its business segments 
cash flows from operations of million in  which included approximately million received from tennessee gas discussed above  were used in part to fully redeem the company s two public debt issues and to finance the company s capital expenditure program 
the redemption of debt strengthened the company s financial condition  reducing the debt to capital ratio to and lowering interest expense see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
the resolution of the litigation and termination of the remainder of the tennessee gas contract together with the lower debt position have improved the company s ability to access capital markets 
the company continues to assess its existing asset base in order to maximize returns and develop full value through strategic diversification and acquisitions in all of its operating segments 
this ongoing assessment includes  in the exploration and production segment  evaluating ways in which the company could diversify the mix of its oil and gas reserves and offset the impact of declining production through domestic development  exploration and acquisition activity outside of the bob west field 
in the refining and marketing segment  the company has been engaged in studies to improve profitability and has also evaluated possible joint ventures  strategic alliances or business combinations  such evaluations have not resulted in any transaction but operating strategies have been developed to optimize the product and feedstock slates  improve efficiencies and reliability  and expand marketing to increase placement of products in alaska 
the company continues to evaluate its marine services segment  pursuing opportunities for expansion as well as optimizing existing operations 
in these regards  during  the company made significant progress with each of its operating segments contributing to improved profitability 
in  the company acquired coastwide for approximately million shares of tesoro s common stock and million in cash and purchased exploration and production properties  proved and unproved  outside of the bob west field for million see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements in item the company operates in an environment where its liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products  market uncertainty and a variety of additional risks that are beyond the control of the company 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  the proximity of the company s natural gas reserves to pipelines  the capacities of such pipelines  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall market and economic conditions 
the company s future capital expenditures as well as borrowings under its credit facility and other sources of capital will be affected by these conditions 
credit arrangements in june  the company amended and restated its corporate revolving credit agreement credit facility  expiring in april  which provides total commitments of million from a consortium of nine banks 
the credit facility provides for cash borrowings up to million and issuance of letters of credit up to a borrowing base which was approximately million at december  
the credit facility replaced a higher cost million facility and provides the company with more financial flexibility  including lower interest rates  reduced fees on letters of credit  elimination of certain restrictive financial tests  an increased borrowing base  increased cash borrowing availability  and the right to enter into non recourse or limited financings for certain subsidiaries 
the company  at its option  has currently activated total commitments of million 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit of million with no cash borrowings outstanding 
outstanding obligations under the credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the company s trade accounts receivable and product inventory and by mortgages on the company s refinery and south texas natural gas reserves 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to maintain specified levels of consolidated working capital  tangible net worth  cash flow and interest coverage 
among other matters  the credit facility contains covenants which limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness and restricted payments 
although the terms of the credit facility allow for the payment of cash dividends subject to a cumulative amount available for dividend payments which is defined as the difference of i the sum since december   of a million and b of consolidated net earnings of the company in any calendar year and ii any amount previously paid for dividends since june  cash dividends cannot exceed a maximum of million annually 
the credit facility also permits the company to repurchase a limited amount of common stock for oddlot buyback programs  employee benefit plans and open market repurchases 
the board of directors has no present plans to pay dividends 
however  from time to time  the board of directors reevaluates the feasibility of declaring future dividends 
in november  a subsidiary of the company entered into a loan facility with a bank  which provides a three year line of credit up to million to the marine services segment for the purchase of real estate and equipment at the bank s prime rate 
the loan facility  which is subject to a borrowing base  is not guaranteed by the company and is secured only by such real estate and equipment that are financed 
beginning in march  credit availability is reduced quarterly by 
at december   
million was outstanding under the loan facility

in and  based on a per barrel throughput charge of cents  the company s variable payments to the state amounted to million and million  respectively 
the per barrel charge increased to cents in with the company s variable payment to the state totaling million in the year 
the per barrel charge of cents in increases to cents in with one cent annual incremental increases thereafter through in january  the company is obligated to pay the state million  provided  however  that such payment may be deferred indefinitely by continuing the variable monthly payments to the state beginning at cents per barrel for and increasing one cent per barrel annually thereafter 
variable monthly payments made after january will not reduce the million obligation to the state 
the million obligation is evidenced by a security bond  and the bond and the throughput barrel obligations are secured by a mortgage on the company s refinery 
the company s obligations under the agreement with the state and the mortgage are subordinated to current and future senior debt of up to million plus any indebtedness incurred subsequent to the date of the agreement to improve the company s refinery

additionally  in the company will direct million towards a three year capital program to build new retail outlets and remodel existing stations in the refining and marketing segment 
the marine services segment s capital budget is million  primarily for expansion of its operations along the gulf of mexico and potential acquisitions 
capital expenditures for are expected to be financed through a combination of cash flows from operations  available cash reserves and borrowings under revolving credit lines 
cash flows components of the company s cash flows are set forth below in millions cash flows from used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
during  net cash from operating activities totaled million  compared with million in this increase in operating cash flows in was primarily due to the receipt of million from tennessee gas for the favorable resolution of litigation in august and termination of the natural gas purchase and sales contract effective october  in addition  improved profitability plus noncash items  such as depreciation  depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes  contributed to higher cash flows from operations 
partially offsetting these increases were higher net working capital balances  particularly receivables which increased due to higher year end sales volumes together with higher prices 
net cash used in investing activities of million in included capital expenditures of million and cash consideration of nearly million for the acquisition of coastwide
