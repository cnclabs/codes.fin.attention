statement of income net interest income net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is determined by the volume of interest earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets and the cost of supporting funds 
the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets with an adjustment made to tax exempt income to provide comparability with taxable income and the cost of supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin

asset liability management asset liability management functions to maximize profitability within established guidelines for liquidity  capital adequacy and interest rate risk 
management seeks to minimize the risks to earnings and equity associated with movements in market interest rates 
measurement and monitoring of liquidity  capital adequacy and interest rate risk are performed centrally for the corporation and the subsidiary banks  and reported under guidelines established by management  the board of directors and regulators 
interest rate sensitivity is traditionally measured in three ways the difference  or gap  between interest sensitive earning assets and interest sensitive interest bearing liabilities  the resultant change in net interest income due to market interest rate fluctuations  and the effect of interest rate movements on the market  or economic value of assets  liabilities and equity 
management believes that the three measurement techniques are complimentary and are used together for management of interest rate risk with the corporation 
the corporation utilizes an asset liability management simulation model to measure potential earnings and economic value of equity risk 
the simulation model  because of its dynamic nature  can capture the effects of present and future balance sheet trends  differing patterns of interest rate movement and changing relationships between rates basis risk 
additionally  the model captures the impact of varying levels of prepayment risk on certain loan and investment categories and embedded options risk on deposits and alternative funding sources relative to movements in market rates 
while most assets and liabilities reprice either at maturity or in accordance with their contractual terms  several balance sheet components demonstrate characteristics that require adjustments to more accurately reflect their repricing behavior 
assumptions based on historical pricing relationships and anticipated market conditions are made to certain core deposits to reflect the elasticity of the changes in their interest rates relative to changes in market rates 
the corporation separately utilizes outside sources to measure the effects of rising and declining rates on its mortgage backed securities portfolios 
this data is incorporated into the simulation model 
according to these sources  the market value of these securities would decrease by approximately with an average life extension of years given a basis point rise in market rates  and increase by approximately with an average life decrease of years under a basis point decrease in market rates 
year end simulations which forecast changes in net interest income that may result from movements in interest rates over the forward twelve month time horizon indicate that net interest income would decrease by approximately given a rise of basis points in market rates over the forward period and an increase of approximately given a decline of basis points 
likewise  the economic value of equity would decrease by approximately and increase by approximately under immediate and sustained basis point market rate increases and decreases  respectively 
the measurement of liquidity is performed by monitoring ratios that indicate the level of liquid assets relative to liabilities  the dependence on potential volatile funding sources  and the relationship of loans to deposits 
while relying on core deposit relationships as the basis of liquidity  increased loan demand over the year has resulted in the corporation seeking alternative sources of liquidity and utilizing existing sources to a higher level within established liquidity guidelines 
it is anticipated that this trend will continue in to meet future liquidity needs  the corporation and its subsidiary banks have expanded funding sources  primarily with the federal home loan bank  and continue to seek other alternative funding sources 
effects of inflation over the past few years  the rate of inflation has been relatively moderate 
however  because interest rates and the level of loans and deposits generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  the financial statements reflect these effects of inflation
