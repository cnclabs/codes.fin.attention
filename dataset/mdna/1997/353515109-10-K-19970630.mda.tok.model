item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview after five consecutive years of sales increases culminating in substantial increases in both domestic and international sales for fiscal and  the company s revenues declined in fiscal as the domestic market for small consumer electronics stagnated 
the company s domestic consumer sales decreased by in the current fiscal year 
international growth slowed in the fiscal year and only offset in part the domestic decline 
international sales growth over the period was due to the company s increased marketing efforts abroad  primarily in the united kingdom  france and canada  and the opening of new sales and marketing wholly owned subsidiaries in germany  mexico  colombia  and australia 
during the last three years  the company benefitted from improvement in the price performance of ic rom chips 
because ic rom chips are a significant part of the cost of franklin electronic books  declining semiconductor prices allowed the company to lower product prices significantly 
another factor enabling the company to reduce its electronic book prices has been the company s continued commitment to cost reduction 
management believes that lower prices  in turn  led to marked increases in domestic sales in both unit and dollar terms and the introduction of new titles and platforms contributed significantly to the company s sales growth during the fiscal and and ameliorated the fiscal decline 
the company expects sales growth in the immediate future to be driven primarily by the sale of personal information management products to be produced under the recently licensed rolodex r electronics trademark 
because the consumer brand awareness of the rolodex r mark is not as strong in international markets as in the united states  sales of personal information management products are expected to increase sales in the united states and reverse the recent trend in which company wide sales growth has been attributed primarily to international sales growth 
additional sales growth would be expected from domestic marketing initiatives geared toward increasing brand awareness for bookman products and to increasing international sales expected to be based in part on the opening of new markets by establishing additional wholly owned sales and marketing subsidiaries in other countries 
as the company continues to introduce new foreign language books  bilingual electronic dictionaries and books targeted at the esl market  management anticipates that the company s international electronic publishing sales should increase as a percentage of total electronic publishing sales 
over the last three fiscal years  the company s gross profit margins have increased primarily due to the decline in cost of ic rom chips and the company s cost reduction efforts which have enabled the company to lower its product prices  and the introduction of new products which command higher gross margins 
the company expects that its gross margins will be negatively impacted by sales of personal information management products  which  not having licensed content found in the company s electronic books  traditionally command lower margins in the highly competitive worldwide market for electronic databanks and organizers 
any improvements in gross margins in the future would need be driven by significant shifts in the company s revenue mix toward the more profitable ic rom cartridges for its bookman products 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant over fiscal and  but in fiscal such expenses increased  primarily because sales decreased 
the company expects its research and development expenses to remain relatively constant in the near term 
the recent increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to increased staff and the personnel needed to operate the company s international subsidiaries and to product introductions in the rolodex r electronics line of personal information management products 
the company anticipates that  as it furthers its strategy of popularizing bookman units by advertising and expanding its shelf space with the rolodex r electronics line  its sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of sales  will continue to increase 
prior to the fiscal year  the company s effective tax rate was minimal due to the realization of net operating loss carryforwards

less than year ended march  compared with year ended march  sales of million for the year ended march  were lower than sales of million one year earlier 
the sales decrease is attributable to lower sales of electronic books in the domestic consumer market offset in part mainly by increases in sales outside of the united states and secondarily by the company s sales of personal information management products in the rolodex r electronics line 
while international sales increased from year to year  this increase was less than in prior years and international growth slowed in the last quarter of the fiscal year 
because the consumer brand awareness of the rolodex r mark is not as strong in international markets as in the united states  sales of personal information management products are expected to increase sales in the united states and reverse the recent trend in which company wide sales growth has been attributed primarily to international sales growth 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations from year to year

sales and marketing were up by million from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal in connection with the establishment of new subsidiaries and increased advertising 
general and administrative expenses increased from million of sales in fiscal to million of sales in fiscal primarily due to the establishment of new foreign subsidiaries 
research and development expenses were relatively constant as a percentage of sales decreasing slightly from to even as the company continued to develop new cards for the bookman platform 
inflation and currency transactions inflation has had no significant effect on the operations of the company for the three years ended march  however  competitive pressures and market conditions in the future may limit the company s ability to increase prices to compensate for general inflation or increases in prices charged by suppliers 
the company s operating results may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions to limit its exposure to losses on anticipated cash flows resulting from fluctuations in the currency markets 
anticipated transactions are comprised primarily of sales of the company s products in currencies other than us dollars made through the company s subsidiaries 
as of march  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding foreign exchange contracts in which foreign currencies were sold 
the deferred gains and losses on such contracts were immaterial at march  and such hedging has had no significant effect on the operations of the company for the three years ended march  the duration of these anticipated hedging transactions generally does not exceed one year 
seasonality the christmas selling season october  november and december and the back to school season mid august to mid september are the strongest selling periods for the company s products 
the timing of the publication of new books may also significantly affect revenues and cause quarterly revenues and earnings fluctuations

on march   the company completed the issuance to insurance companies in a private placement transaction of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes and contemporaneously entered into a new  revolving credit agreement with the chase manhattan bank chase and summit bank summit 
management believes that the proceeds of the senior note offering  cash flow from operations  and the new revolving line of credit will be adequate to provide for the company s liquidity and capital needs  including its proposed international expansion  for the foreseeable future 
in order to accommodate seasonal inventory and accounts receivable buildup  prior to the issuance of the senior notes  the company financed its day to day operations by drawing down advances  on an as needed basis  against its then existing credit facility with chase 
on october   the company drew down approximately  under that facility in order to purchase from insilco certain assets and a trademark license relating to the rolodex r electronics business  which drawdown increased the company s borrowings under that facility to approximately  at the beginning of its third fiscal quarter
