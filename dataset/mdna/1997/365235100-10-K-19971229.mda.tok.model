comparable restaurant sales includes all restaurants open for at least months at the end of such quarter  and compares results for those restaurants with the results for the same period in the prior year 
the company s restaurants experience seasonal influences  as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is realized during the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have been and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income on a quarterly basis may fluctuate and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year

see business risks capital requirements 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to guests 
business risks the company s business is subject to a number of risks 
certain operating results and consideration 
in fiscal  and  respectively  the company experienced an increase of  an increase of  and an increase of  respectively  in comparable restaurant sales 
the company s newer restaurants have not historically experienced significant increases in guest volume following their initial opening period 
in addition  the company does not believe it has significant latitude to achieve comparable restaurant sales growth through price increases 
as a result  the company does not believe that the comparable restaurant sales growth in fiscal is indicative of future trends in comparable restaurant sales 
the company believes that it may from time to time in the future experience declines in comparable restaurant sales  and that any future increases in comparable restaurant sales would be modest 
expansion risks 
the company opened seven full size restaurants in fiscal and has opened seven in fiscal  and currently intends to open eleven restaurants in fiscal the company s ability to achieve its expansion plans will depend on a variety of factors  many of which may be beyond the company s control  including the company s ability to locate suitable restaurant sites  negotiate acceptable leases or purchase terms  obtain required governmental approvals and construct new restaurants in a timely manner  attract  train and retain qualified and experienced personnel and management  operate its restaurants profitably and obtain additional capital  as well as general economic conditions and the degree of competition in the particular region of expansion 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  delays in restaurant openings from time to time 
the company incurs substantial costs in opening a new restaurant and  in the company s experience  new restaurants experience fluctuating operational levels for some time after opening 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully expand into new regions or that the company s existing or new restaurants will be profitable 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
capital requirements 
in addition to funds generated from operations  the company will need to obtain external financing to complete its expansion plans for fiscal year and beyond 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed 
additionally should the company s results of operations decrease or should costs or capital expenditures rise  the company may not have the ability to open new restaurants at its desired pace or at all  because capital may not be available 
cost sensitivity 
the company s profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor and other operating costs 
the company s dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects it to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could materially adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
in addition  unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation  food  labor and employee benefit costs including increases in hourly wage and minimum unemployment tax rates  rent increases resulting from the rent escalation provisions in the company s leases  and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the company 
the company believes recent relatively favorable inflation rates and part time labor supplies in its principal market area have contributed to relatively stable food and labor costs in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue or that the company will have the ability to control costs in the future 
minimum wage 
the company has recently experienced increase in hourly wage rates due to an increase in the federal way rate on october   and september   and in california on march  the company expects to experience another increase on march  in california 
while the company has managed to absorb the first increases without a reduction in profitability  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to absorb the increase on march  or any future potential increases 
importance of key employees 
the company is heavily dependent upon the services of its officers and key management personnel involved in restaurant operations  purchasing  expansion and administration 
in particular  the company is dependent upon the management and leadership of its three executive officers  michael mack  dave qualls and greg keller 
the loss of any of these three individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results of operations 
the success of the company and its individual restaurants depends upon the company s ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified restaurant operations and other management personnel 
the company faces significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
the company s business experiences seasonal fluctuations as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is generally realized in the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have been and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income on a quarterly basis may fluctuate and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
geographic concentration in california  restaurant base 
twenty nine of the company s existing restaurants are located in california 
accordingly  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region  including natural disasters or other acts of god that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s significant investment in  and long term commitment to  each of its restaurant sites limits its ability to respond quickly or effectively to changes in local competitive conditions or other changes that could affect the company s operations 
in addition  the company has a small number of restaurants relative to some of its competitors 
consequently  a decline in the profitability of an existing restaurant or the introduction of an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s result of operations than would be the case in a company with a larger number of restaurants 
legal matters 
the company closed a leased restaurant in september and filed a lawsuit against the landlord for a breach of contract 
the landlord has countersued the company for damages 
an unfavorable decision against the company could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated since the initial public offering of the common stock in may quarterly operating results of the company and other restaurant companies  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the restaurant industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies
