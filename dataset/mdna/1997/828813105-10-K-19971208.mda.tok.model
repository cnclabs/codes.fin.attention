simon in with a single truck  simon transportation today provides nationwide  predominantly temperature controlled truckload transportation for numerous major shippers 
in recent years  much of the company s growth has resulted from earning core carrier status with major shippers and meeting the demands of these shippers for additional equipment 
the company has grown to million in revenue for its fiscal year ended september   from million in revenue for fiscal  a compounded annual growth rate of 
during the same period  operating earnings increased to million from million  a compounded annual growth rate of during fiscal years and  the company financed most of its tractors and trailers with debt and capitalized leases 
in the and fiscal years  the company financed most of this revenue equipment with operating leases rather than borrowing 
financing equipment with operating leases increases the company s operating ratio because the implied interest component of the lease payments is reflected as an above the line operating expense rather than interest expense 
the method of financing does not affect net income 
the company s operating ratio may fluctuate from time to time based upon the method of equipment financing 
the company operated as an s corporation from october  to november  as a result  the company s net taxable earnings were taxed directly to the company s existing stockholders rather than to the company

rent increased million  to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  rent increased to of revenue during the fiscal year from during the fiscal year as the company added new equipment and replaced equipment that had been financed under capital lease arrangements with equipment financed under operating leases 
the company has utilized operating leases in the most recent year because of more favorable terms

liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required significant investment in new revenue equipment that the company historically has financed with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  equipment leases from third party lessors  borrowings under its line of credit  and cash flow from operations 
the company s primary sources of liquidity currently are funds provided by operations and borrowings and leases with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million  for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
the company s principal use of cash from operations is to service debt and capitalized leases incurred to purchase new revenue equipment and internally finance accounts receivable associated with growth in the business 
accounts receivable increased   and  for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
the average age of the company s accounts receivable was   and days for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
net cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively  and consisted of net purchases of property and equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures primarily for revenue equipment  and satellite communications units  net of revenue equipment trade ins  to be approximately million in and the company s projected capital expenditures will be funded mostly with operating leases  borrowings and cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively  and consisted primarily of approximately million in net proceeds from the company s february secondary public offering  million in net proceeds from the company s november initial public offering  net payments on borrowings of million  million  and million of principal under the company s long term debt and capitalized lease agreements and net payments borrowings of  million  and million under the company s line of credit

above the day london interbank offered rate libor in effect from time to time 
at september   the company had outstanding long term debt and capitalized lease obligations including current portions of approximately million  most of which comprised obligations for the purchase of revenue equipment 
see notes  and to consolidated financial statements 
although the company historically has experienced a working capital deficit common to many truckload carriers that have expanded by financing revenue equipment purchases  management believes its working capital deficits have had little impact upon liquidity 
when the purchase of revenue equipment is financed through borrowing or capitalized lease obligations  a portion of the indebtedness is categorized as a current liability  although the revenue equipment is classified as a long term asset 
consequently  each purchase of financed revenue equipment decreases working capital 
the company s working capital surplus at september  and was million and million  respectively 
the company s working capital deficit amounted to million at september  management believes that available borrowings under the line of credit  future borrowings under installment notes payable or lease arrangements for revenue equipment  and cash flow generated from operations  will allow the company to continue to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures  and obligations under debt and capitalized and operating leases at least through fiscal year inflation inflation has had a minimal effect upon the company s profitability in recent years 
most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
the company expects that inflation will affect its costs no more than it affects those of other truckload carriers 
seasonality the company experiences some seasonal fluctuations in freight volume  as shipments have historically decreased during the first calendar quarter 
in addition  the company s operating expenses historically have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
fuel availability and cost the company actively manages its fuel costs by requiring drivers to fuel at company terminals or  whenever possible en route  at service centers with which the company has established volume purchasing arrangements 
the company controls fuel purchases by using its proprietary software and qualcomm communications ability to schedule fueling stops and amounts purchased based upon fuel prices at locations on drivers routes 
the company historically has been able to pass through most increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of higher rates and fuel surcharges 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
increases in fuel prices usually are not fully recoverable 
accordingly  high fuel prices can have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers 
competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to drivers or curtail the company s growth 
delay in delivery of revenue equipment 
the company has scheduled delivery of approximately  tractors during the next two years 
the inability of revenue equipment manufacturers to make delivery as scheduled could impede the company s ability to meet customer demands for revenue equipment and force the company to retain its present fleet of revenue equipment for a longer period of time with potential higher operating expenses associated with an older fleet
