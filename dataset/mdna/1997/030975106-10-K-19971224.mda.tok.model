item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analysis of results of operations the following analysis compares the partnership s results of operations for the year ended september  fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal and fiscal with the weeks ended september  pro forma fiscal 
pro forma fiscal includes an additional week of results ie the period september to september  due to the difference in the partnership s and the predecessors year ends 
the pro forma fiscal statement of operations data was derived from the historical statements of operations of the predecessors for the period september  to april  and the statement of operations of the partnership from april  to september  the fiscal pro forma statement of operations was prepared to reflect the effects of the partnership formation as if it had been completed as of september  the pro forma fiscal statement of operations data do not purport to present the results of operations of the partnership had the formation of the partnership actually been completed as of september  in addition  the pro forma fiscal statement of operations data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the partnership  the consolidated financial statements of petrolane  and the combined financial statements of amerigas propane  and the related notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
significant pro forma adjustments reflected in the data include a the elimination of income taxes as a result of operating in a partnership structure  b an adjustment to interest expense resulting from the retirement of approximately million of petrolane term loans  the restructuring of petrolane and amerigas propane senior debt  and the issuance of an aggregate million face value of notes of amerigas partners and the operating partnership  c the elimination of management fees previously charged to petrolane by ugi  d a net reduction in amortization expense resulting from the longer term year amortization of the excess purchase price over fair value of of the net identifiable assets of petrolane  compared with the amortization of of petrolane s excess reorganization value over years  and e the elimination of intercompany revenues and expenses

partnership results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal retail sales of propane decreased in fiscal reflecting  in part  the effects of warmer heating season weather 
in addition  significantly higher and more volatile propane market prices during the first half of the fiscal heating season resulted in customer conservation efforts 
wholesale volumes of propane sold were lower in fiscal principally due to reduced low margin sales of storage inventories 
total revenues from retail propane sales increased million reflecting a million increase as a result of higher average retail propane selling prices partially offset by a million decrease as a result of the lower volumes sold 
the higher prices resulted principally from higher propane product costs experienced by the partnership early in fiscal the spot price of propane at mont belvieu  texas  a major us storage and distribution hub  increased dramatically during much of the last quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  rising to a high of cents a gallon on december  wholesale propane revenues decreased million reflecting the lower wholesale volumes sold partially offset by higher average wholesale prices 
other revenues decreased million primarily as a result of lower hauling and appliance sales and service revenues 
total propane margin was greater in fiscal because of higher average retail unit margins partially offset by lower volumes of propane sold 
although the partnership s propane product costs were significantly higher in fiscal  the partnership benefited from favorable fixed price supply arrangements and  to a lesser extent  derivative commodity contracts entered into as part of its propane supply strategy 
the higher fiscal average retail unit margin also reflects the fact that retail unit margins in the prior year period were adversely impacted by certain sales and marketing programs 
the increase in fiscal operating income and earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is the result of higher total margin  greater miscellaneous income  and a decrease in operating expenses 
total operating expenses were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the fiscal operating expenses are net of million from a refund of insurance premium deposits and million from a reduction in accrued environmental costs 
excluding the impact of these items in fiscal  operating expenses declined million reflecting in large part lower expenses related to sales and marketing programs and lower required accruals for general and automobile liability and workers compensation costs 
miscellaneous income increased million in fiscal reflecting million of income from the sale of the partnership s interest in atlantic energy  inc atlantic energy  which owns and operates a liquefied petroleum gas storage terminal in chesapeake  virginia 
the partnership sold its interest in atlantic energy after determining that it was not a strategic asset 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal reflecting increased interest expense on the partnership s revolving credit and acquisition facilities principally as a result of higher amounts outstanding 
fiscal compared with pro forma fiscal retail volumes of propane sold increased million gallons in fiscal reflecting the effects of colder weather  acquisitions and volume growth 
regional temperature differences in fiscal were significant with the western us experiencing substantially warmer than normal temperatures and lower retail sales  and the eastern and midwestern us experiencing colder than normal temperatures and higher retail sales 
wholesale volumes of propane sold were significantly higher reflecting an increase in sales of low margin excess storage inventories 
total revenues from retail propane sales increased million reflecting a million increase from the greater volumes sold and a million increase as a result of higher average retail propane selling prices 
total cost of sales increased million as a result of the higher volumes of propane sold and higher average propane product costs 
the partnership s propane product cost averaged approximately five cents a gallon higher in fiscal than in pro forma fiscal the spot price of propane at mont belvieu  texas increased dramatically in august and september  rising to cents per gallon on september  compared to cents per gallon a year earlier 
total propane margin was higher in fiscal as a result of the greater volumes of propane sold 
however  average retail unit margins in fiscal were slightly lower than in pro forma fiscal  notwithstanding an increase in average retail selling price  reflecting the impact of higher average propane product costs which were not completely passed through to customers 
the increases in fiscal operating income and ebitda reflect principally the increase in total propane margin partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal are net of million from a refund of insurance premium deposits and million from a reduction in accrued environmental costs recorded in the quarter ended march operating expenses in pro forma fiscal include million in accruals for management reorganization activities 
operating expenses  exclusive of these items  increased million reflecting higher payroll and employee compensation expenses associated with the partnership s new management structure  higher vehicle and distribution expenses due in part to the higher retail volumes and severe eastern us winter weather  higher expenses associated with sales and marketing programs  increased customer equipment repair and maintenance expenses  and incremental costs associated with acquisitions and new district locations 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s principal sources of funds are those generated by its operations and borrowings under the operating partnership s bank credit agreement 
cash generated by operating activities in was sufficient to fund maintenance capital expenditures which represent capital expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of the capital assets of the partnership and the minimum quarterly distribution mqd of 
for each quarter on all partnership units 
effective september   the operating partnership amended and restated its bank credit agreement 
the bank credit agreement consists of a revolving credit facility and an acquisition facility 
obligations under the bank credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the operating partnership s assets 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million including a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility may be used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and interest and distribution payments 
the revolving credit facility expires september  but may  under certain conditions  be extended 
the operating partnership s bank loans outstanding totaled million at september  compared with million at september  the bank credit agreement also includes a million acquisition facility to finance propane business acquisitions 
this facility operates as a revolving facility through september  at which time amounts then outstanding will convert to a quarterly amortizing four year term loan 
at september   borrowings under the acquisition facility totaled million 
the ability of the operating partnership to borrow under the bank credit agreement is subject to provisions which require  among other things  minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to ebitda ratios  as defined 
based upon the calculation of such ratios as of september   the operating partnership had the ability to borrow the maximum amount available see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
the operating partnership also has a revolving credit agreement with the general partner under which it may borrow up to million to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and interest and distribution payments 
the general partner credit facility is coterminous with  and generally comparable to  the revolving credit facility except that borrowings under the general partner facility are unsecured and subordinated to all senior debt of the operating partnership 
ugi has agreed to contribute on an as needed basis through its subsidiaries up to million to the general partner to fund such borrowings 
management believes that cash flow from operations as well as available borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the partnership s liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
the partnership has assumed certain lease guarantees and scheduled claim obligations relating to certain former businesses of petrolane  a predecessor company of the partnership 
the partnership succeeded to petrolane s agreements with third parties for payment indemnification relating to such obligations 
at september   the lease guarantee obligations totaled approximately million and scheduled claims of at least million were pending 
to date  the partnership has not paid any amounts under the lease guarantee and scheduled claim obligations see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to its available cash as defined in the amended and restated agreement of limited partnership for such quarter  subject to limitations under its loan agreements 
for a description of available cash and the priority of its distribution to unitholders  see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
during  and  the partnership paid the mqd of 
on all limited partner units outstanding 
the amount of available cash needed during fiscal to distribute the mqd on all such units as well as the general partner interest was approximately million million for the common units  million for the subordinated units  and million for the general partner interests 
a reasonable proxy for the amount of distributable cash actually generated by the partnership can be determined by subtracting cash interest expense and maintenance capital expenditures from the partnership s ebitda 
distributable cash as calculated for the partnership s full fiscal years since its inception is as follows year ended september  millions of dollars ebitda cash interest expense maintenance capital expenditures distributable cash flow although the level of distributable cash generated in was less than the full mqd  the partnership had cash and short term investment balances of million at the beginning of the year 
due to the seasonal nature of its operating cash flows and working capital needs  the partnership has used the revolving credit facility on a short term basis to fund a portion of distribution payments 
the ability of the partnership to continue to pay the full mqd on its subordinated units will depend upon a number of factors including the level of partnership earnings  the cash needs of the partnership s operations including cash needed for maintenance and growth capital  and the partnership s ability to finance externally such cash needs 
some of these factors are affected by conditions such as weather  competition in the markets served by the partnership  and the cost of propane  which are beyond the control of the partnership 
as further described in note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements  the subordinated units period of subordination will generally extend until the first day of any quarter beginning on or after april  in respect of which certain cash performance and distribution measurements are attained 
in addition  if the partnership attains certain cash performance and distribution measurements  million subordinated units may convert to common units on or after march  and an additional million subordinated units may convert on or after march  based upon such cash performance measurements to date  it is unlikely that the cash performance measurements required for conversion will be attained during fiscal cash flows operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal reflecting a significant improvement in the partnership s operating performance 
changes in operating working capital during fiscal provided 
million of operating cash flow 
during fiscal  changes in operating working capital required million of operating cash flow principally from an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
investing activities 
cash expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million including maintenance capital expenditures of million in fiscal compared with million including maintenance capital expenditures of million in fiscal proceeds from disposals of assets totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal fiscal proceeds include the sale of the partnership s interest in atlantic energy 
maturing short term investments increased cash flows from investing activities by million in fiscal during fiscal  the partnership acquired several propane businesses for million in cash compared with million for acquisitions in fiscal in conjunction with one acquisition during fiscal  the partnership issued  common units having a fair value of million 
financing activities 
during fiscal  the partnership declared and paid the mqd on all units and the general partner s interest totaling million 
in addition  during each of fiscal and fiscal  the operating partnership distributed million to the general partner in respect of the general partner s interest in the operating partnership 
during fiscal  net borrowings under the operating partnership s revolving credit facility totaled million compared with million in fiscal at september   the partnership had million available under the revolving credit facility 
the partnership s cash needs are typically greatest during the first fiscal quarter due to increased working capital needs and interest and distribution payments 
the partnership also borrowed million under its acquisition facility during fiscal there were borrowings of million under the acquisition facility and million under the special purpose facility during fiscal during fiscal  the partnership made long term debt repayments of million compared with repayments of million in fiscal debt repayments in fiscal included million associated with ugi s contribution of the net assets of oahu gas service  inc cash paid for partnership formation fees and expenses during fiscal represents the reimbursement by the partnership of fees and expenses previously paid by amerigas  inc relating to the formation of the partnership 
year matters the partnership has a number of information system improvement initiatives under way that will require increased expenditures during the next several years 
these initiatives include the modification of certain computer software systems to be year compliant 
although final cost estimates to modify current systems have yet to be determined  the partnership does not expect such costs  which will be expensed when incurred  will have a material effect on the partnership s results of operations 
impact of inflation inflation affects the prices the partnership pays for operating and administrative services and  to some extent  propane gas 
competitive pressures may limit the partnership s ability to recover fully propane product cost increases 
the partnership attempts to limit the effects of inflation on its results of operations through cost control efforts and productivity improvements
