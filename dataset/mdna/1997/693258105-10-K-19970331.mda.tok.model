cyclix s loss was  in  compared to a loss of  in typical of similar remanufacturing operations  cyclix s financial operating model results in higher gross margins and higher operating costs than the company s distribution operations 
as the remanufacturing operation grows as a percentage of the company s overall business mix  this different operating model will have an increasing impact on the company s consolidated income statement and operating margins

the gross margin percentage increased in to from in because the gross margin is different for each line of computer spare parts which the company sells  changes in the mix of parts sold by the company during a particular period affect the company s gross margin 
the increase in gross margin experienced in was a result of favorable variations in the mix of parts sold during the year  as well as improved margins for parts sold on exchange  improvements in pricing and purchasing  and the fact that cyclix had slightly higher margins than the remainder of the company s business 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in the primary reason for this decrease in was that the company incurred a significant charge of revenues in connection with the termination of the company s outsourcing agreement with intelogic and the bankruptcy and liquidation of intelogic  with no related intelogic revenues in the last three quarters of depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of net revenues to for the year ended december  compared to in despite a  increase in depreciation and amortization expense

the gross margin percentage decreased during compared to primarily due to changes in the mix of parts sold during compared to because the gross margin is different on each computer spare part which the company regularly keeps in inventory  changes in the mix of parts sold by the company during a particular period effect the company s gross margin 
in addition  the approximate number of parts stocked by the company increased to over  in  from  in sg a as a percentage of net revenues increased substantially during compared to the increase in sg a was principally the result of major increases in three areas compensation severance  intelogic losses  and increases in occupancy expenses 
compensation increased significantly during compared to because of an increase in the number of employees  headcount rose to by year end compared to at year end 
this increase is in addition to the approximately persons terminated during the year as a result of the closure of the component level returned parts repair facility in san antonio  texas the san antonio facility which was acquired by the company from intelogic 
the increases in personnel were necessary to support increased revenue growth  but because training was necessary for many of the company s new employees  salary expense was incurred in advance of improvements to revenues as a result of new personnel 
this was also true at cyclix which began operations in july and  as expected  did not generate sufficient revenue to cover its expenses during compensation expense also increased as a result of  in severance payments made to terminated members of management at the company s corporate headquarters and employees formerly employed at the now closed san antonio facility 
in november the company entered into a supply agreement with intelogic to provide substantially all of the spare parts and replacement parts required by intelogic s service operations to its customers 
in addition to agreeing to supply parts to intelogic  the company acquired the san antonio facility  certain parts inventory  and repair equipment 
intelogic filed for bankruptcy less than months later in march and its business was sold in april following the sale of intelogic  the supply agreement with the company was terminated 
as a result  the company determined to close the san antonio facility and terminated the employment of approximately employees at that facility 
the bankruptcy filing of intelogic resulted in a pre tax charge to the company in of  of which  was for uncollected receivables in excess of the approximately  recovered by the company from its escrow security account with intelogic  and  related to the write off of certain fixed assets formerly used at the san antonio facility 
the balance of the pre tax charge is represented by the severance payments made to terminated employees at the san antonio facility 
the reserves and charges relating to intelogic by quarter were as follows 
the company reserved  against the intelogic receivables during the first quarter   during the second quarter  and recognized a charge of  in the third quarter relating to uncollected receivables  and the write off of fixed assets  formerly used at the closed san antonio facility 
in addition  but to a lesser extent  the company s occupancy expenses increased as a result of the opening of cyclix  the months of rent in the closed san antonio facility  and the movement of the company s management office s into its new headquarters 
the company had no remaining lease obligations on the closed san antonio facility nor on its former corporate offices  and as of the st quarter of the company has relocated its distribution facility and will have no remaining rental obligations on its former distribution facility 
depreciation and amortization increased as a result of capital expenditures made to the company s information system  phone system  and capital expenditures relating to the relocation of the company s headquarters and relocation of the company s distribution facility which was relocated in january  but which was substantially complete in furniture and equipment expenditures also increased with the company s increase in headcount 
increases in working capital required to support the increase in the company s sales resulted in the company becoming a net borrower of cash under its revolving line of credit 
therefore  the company had interest expense of  during as opposed to interest income of  during liquidity and capital resources the company currently maintains a revolving bank line of credit which provides for borrowings of up to a maximum of million  based on a borrowing base of qualified inventory and eligible receivables 
the borrowing base  which is adjusted weekly  was million at december  the company s available borrowing capacity at december   was approximately million 
the line is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company and matures in december further  the company currently has financing agreements in place for that allow for the acquisition of million of capital assets through leasing arrangements 
the company has historically been a net user of cash from operations  and has financed its working capital requirements and its capital expenditures from revolving credit  subordinated debt  equity financing and internally generated funds 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared with million in the decrease in cash used in operating activities resulted largely from net earnings experienced in and changes in working capital requirements  particularly accounts payable and inventories
