net income loss demand for the company s products is seasonal with approximately to of its sales and a majority of its net income usually occurring in the third quarter february  march  and april 
during this period  the company s customers purchase the company s products so that the products will be available to sport fishermen and recreational boat owners for the peak fishing and boating season 
generally  with the exception of the third quarter  quarterly results are dependent on the timing and acceptance of new product introductions  advertising  and product availability  and as such  the company does not experience any consistent quarterly trends for those three quarters

  fourth quarter may july   total for year   demand for the company s products is affected by the rapidly changing technological environment of consumer electronics 
if the company fails to anticipate technological innovations advanced by its competitors and introduce technologically competitive products  demand for the company s products will diminish 
in each of the past three fiscal years  new product sales have accounted for more than of total sales 
additionally  sales of the company s products are affected by adverse changes in economic conditions  increased oil prices or adverse weather conditions 
the company believes that the lower priced and easier to use lcd sonar products available in recent years attracted an increased number of less serious fishermen to the marketplace who are more likely to reduce their purchase of sonar products during adverse economic conditions and or prolonged adverse weather conditions 
the company believes that the sonar market in the united states and canada is mature  with no significant growth in boating or fishing participation in recent years 
any opportunity for growth in these markets will rely on the ability of the company to increase its market share 
some market growth for sonar products is anticipated as related to international markets as the company continues to focus efforts in these areas 
international sales for increased over by million 
canadian sales grew  australian sales were up  and all other international sales increased  primarily because of improving european economies  expanded points of distribution and increased sales of gps products 
the market for gps products  both domestic and international  is expected to continue to expand 
the company s future success in gps is heavily dependent upon keeping pace with competitors who are rapidly introducing new products and new pricing strategies in the increasingly competitive marketplace 
accordingly  the company s future sales could be adversely affected by a reduction in consumer spending  a decline in recreational boating and sport fishing resulting from significant increases in oil prices  or new product introductions by competitors 
sales of sonar products including combination sonar gps units were down million from fiscal to  following a decrease of approximately million from fiscal to the decline in sonar sales when comparing to results from limited product availability caused by production delays on the company s new mid and upper series sonar products in sales of gps products increased approximately million from fiscal to and increased approximately million from fiscal to a significant percentage of the increase for gps in fiscal related to the shipment  late in the year  of two portable mapping units  the globalmap sport and the airmap 
the shipment of these two products had a positive effect on sales and net income for the fourth quarter of the increase is primarily attributable to the introduction of the low cost gimbal mount and hand held gps products 
the company s production of its products is scheduled on the basis of sales forecasts rather than actual orders 
products are designed and manufactured and parts are ordered in advance of the peak sales period so that products can be shipped within days of receipt of customers orders 
the company s profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to accurately forecast and plan for market demand for its products in advance of the peak selling season and to meet the demand of the peak sales months with technologically acceptable products at acceptable prices 
the company begins planning for sales during each fiscal year in february or march of the preceding year 
the planning includes the preparation of an annual sales forecast for the upcoming fiscal year 
the forecast is reviewed by the company at least monthly  and if necessary  the forecast is revised 
the forecast of products must allow time for ordering raw materials and parts  which may take as long as five months for delivery following the company s order  and for manufacturing so that the company has a build up of finished goods inventory sufficient to meet demand prior to the peak sales months 
failure by the company to accurately forecast market trends  introduction of technological advancements  or the demand for particular models can result in a build up of raw material and finished goods inventory that is obsolete or must be liquidated at reduced prices 
the build up of raw material and finished goods inventory in anticipation of orders during the peak selling season  the cash outlays required to purchase tooling to manufacture new products  together with extended payment terms of up to days offered by the company  which historically  results in a significant increase in working capital requirements from a low in june through august to a high in september through december 
the company uses a material requirements planning mrp system to control inventory by eliminating stockpiling and by utilizing a continuous flow method of manufacturing 
under the continuous flow method of manufacturing  parts and supplies are ordered and scheduled for purchase and delivery only at such time as they are expected to be needed in the manufacturing process 
the mrp system also results in a reduction of the company s safety stock and a shorter manufacturing cycle 
however  extenuating circumstances can and do occur which render a mrp system ineffective at controlling inventory levels 
such circumstances were experienced during and are discussed below in working capital 
the following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the financial condition and operating results of the company for fiscal years through reference should also be made to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
results of operations net sales net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal unit sales  which include sonar units  combination sonar navigation units  and stand alone navigation units  increased and the average price per unit decreased 
when comparing fiscal to  unit sales increased because of higher sales of the company s new low cost hand held gps products which are sold primarily to mass merchandisers  mail order catalog companies  retail sporting goods stores and wholesalers 
this increase was slightly offset by decreased sales of the company s sonar products 
the increase in gps sales resulted from the continuing expansion of this market  as well as the company s introduction of the eagle explorer and the lowrance globalnav models which began shipping in the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
also  the two new portable gps products with mapping capabilities  which began shipping in late  were available for the entire year in the decrease in the average price per unit resulted from increased sales of the explorer and globalnav units and an increased weighting in the sonar sales mix toward low priced sonar units 
this weighting was the result of limited availability of the company s six new mid and upper priced sonar products 
production delays resulted in several of these products shipping in limited quantities until late in the third quarter 
additionally  retailers are allocating more shelf space and are open to allocate more inventory dollars to gps at the expense of sonar products due to the rapid growth and market potential of gps 
net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal unit sales decreased and the average price per unit increased 
when comparing fiscal to  unit sales decreased primarily due to decreased sales of the company s eagle sonar products which are sold primarily to mass merchandisers  mail order catalog companies  retail sporting goods store and wholesalers 
management believes that the following factors contributed to reduced eagle sonar sales lack of sonar market growth in north america in general  inventory dollars at retailers  historically committed to sonar  are being redirected to global positioning system gps products  an unusually cold winter and cool spring in many of the company s key markets in the united states 
the target market for eagle sonar products is more affected by adverse weather  a generally weak fishing tackle market  and reduced sales to one of the company s mass merchant retailers 
additionally  sonar sales to original equipment manufacturers oem s were down from levels 
oem sonar sales were down in line with an overall decrease in new boat production versus lowrance unit sales increased versus primarily as the result of the expansion of the lowrance product line into several national retail chains 
reduced unit sales for sonar products were partially offset by increased sales of the company s gps products 
the increase in gps sales resulted from the continuing expansion of this market as well as the introduction of two new portable gps products with mapping capabilities which began shipping in late the increase in the average price per unit resulted from decreased sales of the eagle and oem sonar products offset by increased sales of the higher priced gps products 
gross profit the gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in due primarily to the shift in mix of units sold to the low priced gps units which generally have a correspondingly low profit margin  unplanned production of certain new products in the company s tulsa production facility versus in the new mexico facility  inefficiencies in certain production processes in the tulsa production facility  and high production labor cost and employee turnover in tulsa due to record low unemployment in that labor market 
additionally  the new sonar products  which began shipping in volume in the second and third quarters of  generally carry above average margins for the company  but were not available for much of the year 
the gross profit margin decreased slightly to in from in price decreases on existing gps products caused by competitive market factors resulted in this decline 
operating expenses operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in total costs increased  the major factors contributing to this increase were  additional advertising and marketing expenses related to the company s push to acquire market share in the gps market and in introducing the new sonar products  other variable selling expenses  such as freight out and product returns cost  were up approximately  due to increased volumes  and research and development expenditures were up  due to the company s continuing efforts to develop new products 
expense reductions in general and administrative costs partially offset the effects of the above increases 
operating expenses  comprised of selling  administration and research and development expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in fiscal to in total costs increased  the major factors contributing to this increase were  increased sales and marketing costs associated with efforts aimed at existing sonar markets as well as new gps markets  and increased research and development expenses which resulted from the company s efforts in new product development  primarily gps 
these cost increases were offset by a decrease of  in costs associated with the settlement agreement and license agreement with computrol reached on january   and a decrease in other variable selling expenses consisting of products returns costs 
interest expense interest expense in fiscal increased by  from due to increased borrowing levels primarily associated with the company s revolving credit line 
the increased borrowings under the revolving credit line resulted from higher working capital needs to support increased sales levels  the buildup of inventories  and for support of the move of certain manufacturing operations to the company s mexico manufacturing facility 
interest expense in fiscal increased by  from due to increased borrowing levels primarily associated with the company s revolving credit line 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
for fiscal  the effective tax rate is less than the statutory federal tax rate of due primarily to increases in state income tax credits and refunds of prior years income taxes and related adjustments 
for fiscal  the effective tax rate is less than the statutory federal tax rate of due primarily to the research and development credit offset by state income tax provisions 
income loss net income loss as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the loss in was attributable to the factors discussed above in this section 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital needs increase in the fall and winter months as the company manufactures and stockpiles its products for the peak sales months of january  february  march  and april 
also  the days outstanding in the company s accounts receivable increase in the off season due to favorable purchase terms offered to customers in order to stimulate sales during these slow periods 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations  an accounts receivable and inventory line of credit  and lease financing 
the line of credit allows the company to borrow up to of its qualifying accounts receivable  of qualifying raw materials inventory  and of qualifying finished goods inventory 
borrowings for inventory  however  are limited to  a yearly lease line of credit is usually established to finance the acquisition of qualifying equipment and certain other assets 
traditionally  the company s near term liquidity is at its lowest during the period august through december due to limits on borrowings against inventories  cash outlays required to purchase tooling to manufacture new products  and extended payment terms offered to customers to stimulate sales during the seasonally slow period 
as previously described  it is during this period that the company begins to manufacture and build up inventory levels in anticipation of product demands for the peak sales months 
by the end of the second quarter  sales historically increase and the company s sources of liquidity begin to improve 
in fiscal  the company announced plans to expand its mexican manufacturing operation to meet increasing demand for its products  particularly gps models 
the company entered into a long term lease for a new manufacturing facility and was responsible for funding a large portion of the leasehold improvements necessary for the building to meet its specific production needs 
in addition to funding the leasehold improvements  it was necessary to build additional inventory levels during the last few months of fiscal to support expected sales during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company began relocating certain of its manufacturing operations to its new plant in mexico 
the start up of the new facility in mexico was substantially on schedule 
however  record low unemployment rates in tulsa resulted in excessive turnover of production workers and an inability to maintain sufficient trained staff to support the company s substantially increased production schedule intended to support record demand for its gps products 
this problem was magnified by management s focus on the start up of the new mexico facility and production delays of the company s six new sonar models 
these problems caused an excessive build up of raw material and work in process inventories that the company could not convert to finished goods until after the peak selling season 
these factors resulted in inventories remaining well above historical levels throughout fiscal management has implemented controls to better manage production scheduling and inventory levels 
inventory is expected to gradually decline throughout fiscal management expects the sources discussed above  combined with a new  term loan and up to  of expanded borrowings under its existing line of credit  to satisfy the company s current financing needs 
at july   there were approximately million of borrowings available under the company s revolving line of credit 
this additional availability was related solely to the timing of payments to vendors and was depleted in early august as is consistent with prior years  management expects to be at maximum borrowing limits through the first three quarters of fiscal because the line of credit will be at its maximum during this period  the company will be required to delay payments to vendors as it has historically done 
management does not expect any significant long term effect from these delayed payments as most vendors have supplied the company for many years 
additionally  because of the additional financing noted above  overall lower projected inventory levels and an expected return to profitability in fiscal  the company does not expect payment delays to the levels experienced in fiscal cash flows provided by financing activities for fiscal were used to finance capital additions not financed by leases of million and to provide funds consumed in operating activities of million 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was used to finance capital additions not financed by leases of million and to provide funds consumed in operating activities of million 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating and financing activities was used to finance capital additions not financed by leases of million 
working capital the company s working capital ratio was at july  and at july  change in this ratio is due to the loss in fiscal and the increased inventories at july   as discussed above and below 
inventory levels at july  were up million or from july  this increase resulted from production delays related to a longer than planned transition to the company s new facility in mexico  as well as unplanned delays in producing the company s new products introduced in also  unexpected inefficiencies in the tulsa production facility  discussed above in gross profit  compounded the build up in inventories 
the increase in trade payables directly relates to the increase in inventories and the delays in payments to vendors discussed above 
management expects that inventories will continue to decline during fiscal as the inventory level declines  management also expects payments to vendors to continue to improve correspondingly 
the company does not expect substantial realization problems with this inventory 
long term debt and revolving credit agreement at july   the company s term and revolving credit loan agreement  which is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  provided for interest at a rate up to over prime with maximum borrowings of up to  on the revolving line of credit 
in august  the company expanded the borrowings available under its term and revolving credit loan agreements 
this expanded the financing available by million  including an additional million term loan and up to million of additional borrowings under its revolving line of credit secured by certain inventories and receivables located outside the united states 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended july    and  respectively 
of the fiscal total  approximately million is related to tooling  molds  dies  and equipment to design and manufacture the company s products 
for  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures with substantially all of this amount allocated to production equipment and tooling 
effects of inflation a significant portion of the company s cost and expenses consist of materials  supplies  salaries  and wages that are affected by inflation 
due to the intense market pressures on prices  the company does not believe that it will be able to pass on inflationary increases in its selling prices 
accordingly  the company concentrates on changes in design  manufacturing process  material scheduling  and sourcing to help contain costs 
the company does not expect that the effects of inflation will have a significant impact on its profitability in the near future 
additionally  a significant portion of the company s raw material items are sourced overseas 
significant devaluation of the dollar relative to these currencies would not be able to be passed on in the form of price increases to consumers 
outlook the company anticipates a return to profitability in fiscal  primarily as the result of continuing favorable economic and market conditions  market acceptance of the company s product offering  full year availability of the new product offering  lower manufacturing cost relating to a full years production from the company s new mexico manufacturing facility and lower selling and administrative cost 
management currently anticipates positive cash flows from operations in fiscal based on attaining current projections for net income and inventory levels 
the company is not expecting additional new products to contribute significantly to the net sales projections 
the expectation for returned profitability based on the above factors constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company believes that these forecasts are based on reasonable assumptions  however  no assurances can be given that these goals will be achieved 
if the company experiences production delays due to raw materials shortages or unforeseen competitive pressures  this could have a material adverse affect on current projections 
also  because of the dynamic environment in which the company operates  one or more key factors which are discussed in part i  item business could have an adverse effect on results for the upcoming year
