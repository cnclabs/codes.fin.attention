the decline in new york city ubt in fiscal reflects a change in the tax law effective on january  as of that date  new york city ubt is imposed on the total income of the operating partnership  and the partnership is allowed to claim a credit for its pro rata share of any new york city ubt paid by the operating partnership

income taxes the partnership is not subject to federal  state  or local income taxes  which are the obligations of the individual partners 
however  under current tax law  the partnership will be taxed as a corporation beginning in january both the us senate and house of representatives have passed different versions of hr which if enacted  would allow the partnership to make an election to pay a tax based on gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business rather than a corporate income tax 
the senate version of the bill imposes a tax of of revenues  while the house version imposes a tax of of revenues 
there can be no assurance that either version of these two proposals will ultimately be enacted into law or  if enacted  that the partnership will make any such election 
the imposition of any tax will reduce both net income and cash available for distribution to partners 
in the event that no favorable tax legislation is passed  the partnership will consider conversion of the partnership to corporate form

oppenheimer capital general the operating partnership s results of operations include those of its basic institutional investment management business and those of its subsidiary entities or former subsidiary  opcap advisors formerly quest for value advisors  occ distributors formerly quest for value distributors  oppenheimer capital limited  saratoga capital management saratoga  oppenheimer capital trust company opcap trust  and ama investment advisers  lp ama advisers 
for the periods presented  the operating partnership s operations have been characterized by substantial increases in assets under management 
this growth has been from four principal sources 
first  new clients have entered into investment management agreements and existing clients have added funds to their accounts under management 
second  rising securities price levels have increased the market values of investment portfolios 
third  mutual funds and variable annuities managed by opcap advisors have added to assets under management due to increased sales and market appreciation 
fourth  wrap fee assets have increased due to new accounts opened  expanded distribution to broker dealers and market appreciation 
the growth in assets under management has been tempered by the operating partnership s withdrawal from the low fee rate option management business in fiscal in order to concentrate on businesses offering higher returns 
for the periods presented  the option management business had no material effect on revenues or profitability 
revenues are generally derived from charging a fee based on the net assets of clients portfolios 
all periods presented show increased operating revenue 
revenues for all periods presented consist principally of investment management fees 
in fiscal  the operating partnership began to implement a strategic decision to withdraw from selling directly to the retail market  and to instead market directly to institutions with strong retail distribution capabilities 
in november  the operating partnership withdrew from the open end mutual fund distribution business see the quest sale and began to eliminate retail operations at ama advisers  completing this process in the first quarter of fiscal the operating partnership also reduced the losses incurred by saratoga throughout fiscal  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal sold its interest in saratoga 
additionally  the operating partnership terminated the distribution of unit investment trusts during the fourth quarter of fiscal the value of total assets under management increased to billion at april  from billion at april  the growth of assets under management was tempered by the loss of million in mutual fund assets as a result of the closed end quest for value dual purpose fund redeeming all income fund shares and converting to an open end fund 
for the year ended april   assets under management for separately managed accounts increased to billion  mutual fund and other commingled products increased to billion  and wrap fee accounts increased to billion 
the value of total assets under management increased to billion at april  from billion at april  the growth of assets under management was tempered by the loss of billion in option management accounts with a low effective fee rate and a reduction of million in fixed income mutual fund assets as a result of the quest sale 
for the year ended april   assets under management for separately managed accounts increased to billion from billion  mutual fund and other commingled products increased to billion from billion  and wrap fee accounts increased to billion from billion 
gain on quest sale on november   the operating partnership completed the sale of the investment advisory and other contracts and business relationships for its twelve quest for value mutual funds the quest sale to oppenheimerfunds  inc ofi  which is unrelated to the operating partnership  for an initial purchase price payment of million 
in december  a deferred purchase price payment of million was received by the operating partnership as a result of the assets of the six merged fixed income funds being at stated levels 
the gains on the sale  before new york city unincorporated business tax ubt and minority interest  amounted to million for the year ended april   and million for the year ended april  oppenheimer capital continued gain on quest sale continued total assets of the twelve funds were billion at november  the six equity funds involved  representing billion of those assets  continue to be managed by opcap advisors under a subadvisory contract with ofi  which allows the current portfolio management teams to remain in place 
the six equity funds were renamed the oppenheimer quest value funds the quest funds 
the six fixed income funds  representing approximately million of those assets  were merged into comparable funds managed by ofi 
the overall impact of the quest sale on the operating partnership s results has been highly positive 
although the fee rate as a subadviser is less  assets in the six equity funds have more than tripled to billion at june  as a result of the extensive distribution capabilities of ofi and market appreciation 
in addition  the operating partnership has eliminated distribution expenses related to these funds 
reflecting the impact of these various factors  the profitability of the operating partnership s mutual fund business has increased significantly since the quest sale 
the operating partnership implemented a portion of the mutual fund distribution cost savings prior to the close of the quest sale  and results for the quarter ended april  reflected those savings 
in addition  as a result of the sale  significant expenditures that would have been made in systems  technology  sales and marketing capabilities  and new product development have not been necessary 
on january   the closed end quest for value dual purpose fund the fund redeemed all of its income shares as required by its articles of incorporation  and on february   the fund converted to an open end fund 
the investment contracts and other business relationships were sold to ofi the dual purpose fund sale  and opcap advisors now serves as subadviser to the fund under an agreement with ofi 
the subadvisory fee is significantly lower than the management fee previously earned by the operating partnership 
annual subadvisory fees related to the fund are projected at million annually  based on assets under management at june   while the operating partnership received million of investment management fees for the fiscal year ended april  on july   the operating partnership received an initial payment of million related to the dual purpose fund sale 
operating revenues total operating revenues increased for the year ended april  to million from million for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  total operating revenues includes investment management fees  net distribution assistance and commission income  and interest and dividends 
investment management fees increased to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this increase is a result of average assets under management increasing to billion for the year ended april  from billion for the year ended april  investment management fee revenue grew less than assets under management due to the lower subadvisory fee rates earned on the quest funds than the advisory fee rate prior to the quest sale 
these lower fee rates were more than offset by asset growth for these funds and the elimination of mutual fund distribution expenses 
annual subadvisory fees are projected at million  based on assets under management at june   down slightly from the previous million of annual fees for the twelve quest for value funds at november  assets in the six equity funds have more than tripled to billion at june  from billion on november   reflecting record fund sales and market appreciation 
in addition  investment management fee revenue grew less than the increase in assets under management due to a decline in performance fees earned in fiscal to million from million in fiscal these decreases were offset in part by investment management fees increasing due to higher fee realizations resulting from a continued shift in the asset mix toward higher effective fee rate businesses such as variable annuities and wrap fee accounts 
oppenheimer capital continued operating revenues continued investment management fees increased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april   primarily as a result of average assets under management increasing for the year ended april  from billion for the year ended april  this increase also reflects higher fee realizations as a result of a shift in the asset mix toward the higher fee rate businesses including mutual funds  variable annuities and wrap fee accounts  and the withdrawal from the option management business  which had very low fee rates 
offsetting the increase in part was the lower fee rate earned subadvising the quest funds as a result of the quest sale 
net distribution assistance and commission income decreased to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this decrease reflects reduced commission and distribution income as a result of the quest sale and lower unit investment trust commission income due to reduced demand for fixed income unit investment trusts the operating partnership discontinued the distribution of unit investment trusts in april 
this decrease was offset in part by a million increase in certificate of deposit commission income as a result of increased demand for funds by banks 
net distribution assistance and commission income decreased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  primarily as a result of a million decline in certificate of deposit commission income as a result of lower demand for funds by banks  decreased unit investment trust commission income  and reduced commission and distribution income as a result of the quest sale in november interest and dividend income increased to million for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  this increase can be attributed to higher average cash balances 
interest and dividend income increased to 
million for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  this increase can be primarily attributed to the interest earned on the proceeds received from the quest sale 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased for the year ended april  to million from million for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the operating partnership s most significant expense category is compensation and benefits  which includes salaries  bonuses  sales commissions  incentive compensation and other payroll related expenses 
compensation and benefits expense increased to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  for both years  compensation and benefits increased primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs due to increased new business  higher operating profits and increased participation by key executives in incentive compensation plans as a result of industry competitive pressures and their individual contributions to firm profitability 
in addition  compensation and benefits expense increased due to staff salary increases and additions to staff to support expanding businesses 
these increases were offset in part by significant staff reductions at occ distributors  ama advisers  and in mutual fund accounting in fiscal with most staff reductions occurring after the quest sale in november in fiscal  staff size was reduced as a result of the sale of the operating partnership s interest in saratoga and the termination of the unit investment trust distribution effort during the fourth fiscal quarter 
reflecting these reductions  staff size declined to at april  from at april   and from at april  oppenheimer capital continued operating expenses continued occupancy expense decreased for the year ended april  to million from million for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the decrease for the year ending april  reflects reduced rent expense as a result of the termination of leases at ama advisers as well as adjustments made to rent escalation accruals during the fiscal year 
for the year ended april   the increase was attributable to increased amortization expense relating to leasehold improvements and increased equipment rental costs 
the operating partnership subleases a portion of its space at the oppenheimer tower  world financial center  from oppenheimer co  inc opco  an affiliated broker dealer  paying a pro rata share of opco s lease payments  based on the percentage of total space leased 
the operating partnership is currently in negotiations to lease an additional  square feet at oppenheimer tower to house its growing business 
general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended april  to million from million for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the rate of growth of general and administrative expenses slowed in fiscal and continued in fiscal as the operating partnership realized cost savings from the quest sale and cost reductions at ama advisers 
as a result of the quest sale in november  the operating partnership was able to eliminate all of its outstanding bank loans and related interest expense 
offsetting these reductions in both fiscal and were increased costs incurred in connection with the development of new businesses and increased investments in computer equipment and software as a result of increased technical support for professional and administrative staff and higher professional services expense due to the expansion of the operating partnership s business 
promotional expenses decreased for the year ended april  to million from million for the year ended april  and decreased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the decrease in promotional expenses for both fiscal years was due primarily to a reduction in expenses incurred by occ distributors as a result of the elimination of the open end mutual fund distribution effort  and the retail operations of ama advisers  and was offset in part by increased expenses in the operating partnership s new businesses due to increased travel and entertainment expenses as a result new business activities 
in addition  promotional expenses decreased in fiscal due in part to decreased promotional activities at saratoga 
operating income operating income increased for the year ended april  to million from million for the year ended april  and increased for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  for the year ended april   the operating profit margin expanded to from for the year ended april   and in the year ended april   the operating profit margin increased from for the year ended april  the increase in operating income and operating profit margin for both years is due to rising securities price levels  strong new business growth and the resultant revenue increase combined with the operating partnership controlling the rate of expense growth 
in both fiscal and fiscal  the operating revenue growth rate exceeded the operating expense growth rate 
this was accomplished primarily from the decision to withdraw from the mutual fund distribution business the quest sale  which was completed in the final quarter of fiscal  and the suspension of retail sales activities at ama advisers 
this process  which began in fiscal  was completed in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  losses from saratoga were reduced to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the operating partnership sold its interest in saratoga 
oppenheimer capital continued income taxes the operating partnership is not subject to federal  state  or local income taxes  which are the obligations of the individual partners 
the operating partnership  however  was subject to new york city ubt of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended april   and the decrease in new york city ubt expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to a decline in net income in fiscal as a result of the million gain recorded for the quest sale in fiscal  compared with the million gain in fiscal this decline was offset in part by higher operating income in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in new york city ubt expense in fiscal from fiscal was due to a change in the tax law effective january  imposing taxes on the total income of the operating partnership and allowing the partnership a credit for its pro rata share of any new york city ubt paid by the operating partnership 
prior to january   new york city ubt was assessed directly at the partnership level 
a second reason for the increase was the operating partnership s higher earnings  including the gain realized on the quest sale

a foreign corporate subsidiary is subject to taxes in the foreign jurisdiction in which it is located
