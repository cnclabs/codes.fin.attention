fair value of financial instruments the estimates of fair value of the company s financial instruments have been determined by the company using available market information and valuation methodologies 
the fair values of the company s short term financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  management fees payable and short term borrowings are estimated to equal their carrying amounts or cost basis because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the estimate of fair value of the company s investment in commercial assets is based upon the per share trading price of the common stock of commercial assets 
due to the complex nature of mortgage securitization structures  every non agency mbs bond and cmo ownership interest varies significantly from issuance to issuance 
the collateral for each issuance is separate and distinct from that underlying the collateral of any other issuance 
these instruments are not listed or traded on any exchange or other active market from which to obtain a quoted market price for these financial instruments 
accordingly  the estimates of fair value have been determined by the company using available market information and valuation methodologies 
considerable judgment was required to interpret the market information and develop the estimates of fair value at december  at december   the estimated fair value of the non agency mbs bonds was based upon the anticipated proceeds  net of transaction costs  from contributing the portfolio into the proposed structured transaction 
except for the estimated fair value of the non agency mbs bonds based on the proposed structured transaction  the estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could realize in a current market transaction 
the use of different market assumptions  valuation methodologies or both may have a material effect on the estimates of fair value 
the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of february  future estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s ownership interest in commercial assets was  compared to  at december  the increase in fair value was due to the increase in the trading price per share from per share at december  to per share at december  at february   the closing price of commercial assets was per share 
at december  and  the company s non agency mbs bonds are carried at their estimated fair value of  and  respectively 
the increase in the fair value was due to the acquisition of non agency mbs bonds and unrealized holding gains of  during offset by principal repayments and indemnifications received during the estimated fair value of the company s non agency mbs bonds will fluctuate over time due to  among other things  changes in collateral prepayments and credit performance  size of the company s class relative to the size of the offering  liquidity in the mortgage backed securities market  changes in the values of the related real estate and changes in prevailing long term interest rates
