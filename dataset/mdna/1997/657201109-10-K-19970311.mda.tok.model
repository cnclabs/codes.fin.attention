other relationships 
the company holds licenses and other rights to additional technologies that the company is researching and or developing jointly with various research institutions 
in addition  the company is in various stages of discussions with third parties  including multinational pharmaceutical companies  regarding various business arrangements  including acquisitions  licensing  research and development  distribution  marketing  joint venture and other business agreements  some of which possibly may be concluded in the near term 
there are no assurances that the company will successfully negotiate and sign any such agreement or that  if executed  the financial terms of any such agreement will be significant 
competition competition in the vaccine industry is intense 
the company will face competition from many companies  including a number of large companies and specialized firms in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development and production of vaccines  and major universities and research institutions 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  more extensive experience in conducting clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  greater operating experience  larger research and development and marketing staffs  and greater production capabilities than those of the company 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the vaccine industry are product quality  measured by the safety and efficacy of a vaccine product  ease of administration represented by combination vaccines and vaccines that are stable in liquid form and price 
see marketing of vaccines 
the company believes that its principal competitors in the united states are merck co  pasteur merieux connaught  smithkline beecham plc  and lederle laboratories a subsidiary of american home products  most of which are active in the development of acellular pertussis  combination and conjugate vaccines for use in infants and children 
for example  during and  three companies announced that they had received fda approval for their dtap vaccine for infants and children 
one of these competitors also announced that the fda licensed a vaccine that combines by reconstitution that company s hib vaccine with its dtap vaccine for administration at months of age and that it continues to seek fda approval for administration at two  four and six months of age 
in addition  several competing dtap vaccines and certain combination vaccines have been licensed for sale outside of the united states 
see risk factors competition and technological change 
patents and proprietary information the company actively pursues a strategy of seeking patent protection for valuable patentable subject matter 
the company believes that patent and trade secret protection is an important element of its business and that its success will depend in part on its ability to obtain strong patents  to maintain trade secret protection and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
the company holds as assignee and licensee a number of patents and patent applications 
see business relationships and risk factors patent protection and proprietary information 
the company also relies upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain its competitive position 
disclosure and use of the company s know how is generally controlled under agreements with the parties involved 
in addition  the company has confidentiality agreements with its key employees  consultants and officers 
there can be no assurance that disclosure of the company s trade secretes will not occur  or that others will not independently develop and patent equivalent technology 
government regulation the company is currently subject to regulation by various governmental agencies and to federal and other laws 
united states and foreign regulations will be a significant factor in the production and marketing of the company s products and are currently a significant factor in its ongoing research and development activities 
in order to test  produce and market vaccines  mandatory procedures must be followed to ensure that safety  quality and efficacy standards established by the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries are satisfied 
see also risk factors changes in government purchasing policies for a description of regulatory and legislative initiatives that may affect the marketing and distribution of vaccines 
in the united states  the marketing of human vaccines is subject to fda review and approval 
the steps required before a new human vaccine can be marketed include preclinical studies  the filing of an investigational new drug application ind with the fda  clinical trials in humans to determine safety and efficacy  fda approval of the product for commercial sale  and fda approval of the production related facilities 
the results of the preclinical studies and human clinical trials are submitted to the fda in a product license application  or pla  approval of which must be obtained prior to commencement of commercial sales 
the fda may deny a pla if  among other reasons  clinical trial protocols are not adequate or appropriate 
the fda also may require additional testing or information to assess the safety and efficacy of a company s products if the fda does not view the pla as containing adequate evidence of the safety and efficacy of the product 
notwithstanding the submission of such data  the fda may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval 
even if the pla is approved  the product may be required to undergo post licensure testing and surveillance to continue to monitor its safety and effectiveness 
at this stage  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing 
these regulatory standards relate to  among other things  manufacturing  testing  labelling  advertising and marketing 
the interval between the filing of an ind and the filing of a pla application can be lengthy and in some instances the data obtained from clinical trials authorized under an ind do not support the filing of a pla 
the product manufacturing and support facilities also must be licensed for the production of vaccines 
to accomplish this  an establishment license application ela must be filed with the fda 
the ela describes the facilities  equipment and personnel involved in the manufacturing process 
an establishment license is granted on the basis of inspections of the applicant s facilities in which the primary focus is on compliance with fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp and the applicant s ability to consistently manufacture the product in the facility in accordance with the pla 
if the fda finds the inspection unsatisfactory  it may decline to approve the ela  resulting in a delay in production or distribution by the applicant 
although reviewed separately  approval of both the pla and ela must be received prior to commercial marketing of a vaccine 
presently  there are a number of legislative initiatives being considered in congress and proposed regulations under consideration by the fda  which if adopted  could reform the fda s review and approval processes by  among other things  streamlining the product licensing application processes for biologics  including vaccines 
some of these proposals are designed to eliminate the requirement for elas and to simplify the approval process 
the company is unable to predict which legislative or regulatory initiatives  if any  will ultimately be enacted or the effect that any such initiative may have on the fda s application or approval process for the company s dtap and other vaccines  or on the company s business or results of future operations 
the fda export reform and enhancement act of  which became effective on april   revised the terms and conditions under which biologics may be exported 
the legislation was designed to facilitate the export of drugs  including biologics  by revising and in some circumstances eliminating the requirement for fda approval as a condition of export 
the new legislation now permits  in most cases  a company to commercially export vaccines manufactured in the united states with little or no prior fda review or approval before these vaccines are licensed by the fda for marketing in the united states 
preclinical studies are conducted in the laboratory and in animal systems to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of vaccines 
the results of these preclinical studies are submitted as part of the ind 
human clinical trials may commence if  days after receipt by the fda of the ind  the fda does not notify the ind applicant that the trials are subject to a clinical hold 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new vaccine to healthy volunteers or to patients  under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials are conducted in accordance with certain standards under protocols that detail the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
further  each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board irb at the institution at which the study will be conducted or by a qualified centralized independent irb 
the irb must approve the study to be conducted 
in its review  the irb will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the vaccine into healthy human subjects  the vaccine is tested for safety adverse effects  optimal dosage  and its ability to induce an immune response immunogenicity 
phase ii involves studies in a limited target patient population to further evaluate immunogenicity and optimal dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a product is found to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase iii clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded target patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
clinical trials generally require several years to complete and may be very costly 
to date  the company has been successful in reducing the cost of clinical trials by obtaining third party sponsorship of the clinical trials for its first vaccine products 
the company  where appropriate  may continue to seek third party sponsorship or funding for clinical trials for its vaccine products 
there can be no assurance that such sponsorship or funding  if sought  will be obtained 
the company s activities are subject to specific government quality assurance regulations 
the cgmp regulations set specific requirements for the production of biologics  including vaccines  and similar requirements are also in effect in the european union and other foreign countries where the company has applied or may apply for regulatory approval for clinical studies and or marketing of its vaccines 
the company s research and operations also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health agency  the environmental protection agency  the department of agriculture  and the department of transportation 
the company also is subject to regulation under the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and other regulatory statutes  and may in the future be subject to other federal  state  local or foreign regulations 
the company s compliance with laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment does not have a material effect on the ongoing operations of the company 
the company has not made any material expenditures for environmental control facilities  nor does it anticipate any such expenditures during the current fiscal year 
raw materials laboratory supplies utilized in the company s research and development generally are available from several commercial suppliers under standard terms and conditions 
most raw materials necessary for process development  scale up and commercial manufacturing are generally available from multiple commercial suppliers 
however  certain processes require raw materials from sole sources or materials that are difficult for suppliers to produce and certify to the company s specifications 
in addition  the company may experience temporary or permanent shortages of critical raw materials necessary for continued production of its vaccines 
accordingly  given the specific nature of  and critical need for  certain raw materials  there is a risk that material shortages could delay production efforts  adversely impact production costs and yields  and even necessitate the use of substitute materials 
any of these events could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
see also risk factors dependence on suppliers 
product liability the testing and marketing of vaccines entail an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects 
the extent of this risk was sufficiently great in the united states that  by the mid s  many manufacturers ceased production of pediatric vaccines because of liability exposure 
in response to these withdrawals from the vaccine market  congress enacted the ncvi act to ensure the availability of government mandated pediatric vaccines by addressing the liability of manufacturers for immunization related injuries 
among other things  the ncvi act created a trust fund  supported by an excise tax on each dose of vaccine sold  to compensate eligible injured parties 
compensation awards are statutorily established and are generally limited to actual and projected unreimbursed medical  rehabilitative and custodial expenses  lost earnings  and pain and suffering  together with reasonable attorneys fees 
injured parties are not allowed to bring a lawsuit against the manufacturer unless they have filed a claim with the program  received a final determination and rejected it in favor of litigation 
the ncvi act may not  however  protect vaccine manufacturers against suits by family members of an injured party 
see overview of vaccine market 
as the vaccines covered by the ncvi act include vaccines for the prevention of diphtheria  tetanus  pertussis and polio  the company s dtap and ipv vaccines have certain protection from liability claims 
while none of the company s other products are presently covered by the ncvi act  from time to time there are legislative and regulatory proposals to expand the list of vaccines covered by  and reduce the excise taxes that fund  the program 
in  varicella  hepatitis b and hib vaccines were added to the program s list of covered vaccines provided that congress establishes an excise tax for such vaccines 
in addition  the company is unable to predict whether any other legislative or regulatory proposal will ultimately be enacted or the effect any of these proposals may ultimately have on the company s business or results of future operations 
the company has limited product liability insurance coverage 
it intends to seek additional insurance coverage as it commences commercialization of its vaccines  but there can be no assurance that adequate additional insurance coverage will be available at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not materially adversely affect the business or financial condition of the company 
see risk factors product liability  limited insurance 
employees as of december   the company had full time employees of whom have phd degrees and two have phd degrees

risk factors in addition to the other information included herein  the following risk factors should be carefully considered 
this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  which statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s business and prospects 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section 
dependence upon approval and commercialization of dtap vaccine 
the company has generated only limited revenue from the sale of its acellular pertussis vaccine 
prior to commercial introduction  the company s dtap and combination vaccines must be approved by the fda for sales in the united states and by similar authorities for sales in other countries 
in  the dtap vaccine was approved for sale in sweden and the dtap ipv was approved for sale in denmark 
the dtap vaccine is currently being considered for approval for sale in the united states by the fda 
there can be no assurance as to when or whether the company will receive such approval  or that any such approval will not be subject to additional testing requirements 
the commercial introduction of the company s dtap vaccine will require the company to manufacture and produce large quantities of vaccine in its manufacturing facility  which was modified in for increased production 
the company has limited experience manufacturing commercial quantities of vaccines and operating its manufacturing facility 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the production process will not fail or become subject to substantial disruptions 
see risk factors manufacturing and scale up 
to successfully introduce and commercialize its dtap vaccine  the company will be required to  among other things  participate in established purchasing programs of federal and state governments  establish an identity and reputation for the company and its products  create an awareness among pediatricians of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine  distinguish the company s product from that of its competitors  establish the company as an effective and reliable supplier of vaccines  and establish effective distribution channels 
in october  the company and abbott signed an agreement for abbott to market the company s dtap vaccine and certain combination vaccines in the united states to the private physician and managed care markets upon approval by the fda  with the company marketing those products to governmental purchasers 
there can be no assurance that the company or abbott will successfully implement its sales and marketing strategy 
in attempting to do so  the company believes there will be intense competition from other vaccine producers 
there can be no assurance that the company will produce a commercially viable product  attain sufficient market share  or distinguish its vaccine product from that of its competitors 
currently  the company s prospects for becoming profitable are substantially dependent upon the successful commercialization of the dtap vaccine  as well as the successful development and commercialization of other vaccines under development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully market its vaccine products at levels sufficient to generate profits 
dependence on suppliers 
while the company produces the pertussis component of the dtap vaccine  it has purchased  and intends to continue to purchase  its requirements of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and enhanced ipv from ssi 
there can be no assurance that ssi will be able to meet the company s requirements or that ssi will not experience difficulties in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals or disruptions in its production of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and ipv 
certain of the company s production processes require raw materials from sole sources or materials that are difficult for suppliers to produce and certify to the company s specifications 
the company also may experience temporary or permanent shortages of critical raw materials necessary for continued production of its vaccines 
any shortage of these materials could delay production efforts  adversely impact production costs and yields  or necessitate the use of substitute materials  any of which could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
in addition  the company has contracted with third parties for the sterile fill  labelling  and packaging of its vaccine products until the company obtains its own facilities to perform these operations 
failure of any such contractor to meet the company s requirements may involve costly delays and significant expense  and would require additional regulatory approval as the company seeks alternative arrangements 
changes in government purchasing policies 
children in the united states receive immunizations from public providers  such as local health departments  as well as from private providers 
immunizations provided by public providers are generally paid for through federal and state government funding under public health programs 
these programs are intended to reduce barriers to immunization and to improve immunization rates by providing free vaccine to qualifying low income and uninsured infants and children 
government purchases historically have been at prices substantially below those offered to the private sector and presently account for a substantial portion of the vaccine doses distributed in the united states 
from time to time  legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed that  if adopted  could significantly modify government vaccine programs by  among other things  modifying or restricting the federal government s purchasing authority or substantially increasing or reducing the funding available for government vaccine purchases 
the company is unable to predict which legislative initiative  if any  will ultimately be enacted or the effect any such initiative may ultimately have on the company s business or results of future operations 
in addition  proposals for health care  insurance and tax reform may be considered in the future by federal and state governments and some of these proposals  if adopted  may limit government or third party  private reimbursement policies  or prices charged by pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers for their product 
no assurance of effective marketing 
the company has little experience in marketing its products 
the company is in the process of implementing its marketing and sales plans for its products  however  there can be no assurance that the company s current marketing and sales strategies or the size and make up of the company s sales and marketing organization will be sufficient for the successful commercialization of its products 
the factors affecting successful commercial launch of the company s vaccines in the united states include  among others establishing an identity and reputation for the company and its products  creating an awareness among pediatricians of the safety and efficacy of the company s vaccines  distinguishing the company s products from those of its competitors  establishing the company as an effective and reliable supplier of vaccines  and establishing effective distribution channels 
the company has entered into supply  marketing and distribution agreements with third parties under which such parties hold exclusive rights to market certain of the company s products within their respective territories 
there can be no assurance that any of these third parties will be able to distribute and market those products successfully within its territory 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be successful in negotiating and executing marketing and or distribution agreements with any other third parties covering any products or that any other third party will be able to market the company s products successfully 
see business relationships 
uncertainties related to clinical trials 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any products under development  the company must demonstrate through pre clinical studies and clinical trials that these products are safe and effective 
the results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in large scale clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that large scale clinical trials for any of the company s products will demonstrate safety and efficacy  be sufficient to support application for regulatory approval  or lead to marketable products 
a number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
need for regulatory approvals 
the company has not commercialized any products or received product approval from the fda 
the company s vaccine products  product development activities and manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda  including preclinical and clinical testing requirements  and inspection and approval processes 
approval of the company s products for commercial introduction in the us currently requires both a license for each product and a license for each production facility 
the process of obtaining licenses can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that the licenses will be granted  or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to market products 
there also can be no assurance that any of the products under development by the company will demonstrate the safety or efficacy profiles necessary for regulatory approval  or that the company s products under development or its production facility will receive the requisite regulatory approvals and licenses in a timely fashion or at all 
there also can be no assurance that the fda or other regulatory authorities will not require the company to conduct additional testing to assess the safety and or efficacy of the company s vaccines  including its dtap vaccine 
even if the necessary licenses are obtained from the fda  there may be limitations on product use and the fda can withdraw approvals at any time upon the occurrence of unforeseen problems 
the fda can also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and require a recall of such products 
the fda regulations depend heavily on administrative and scientific interpretation and advisory committee determinations  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible prospective and retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
in addition  the fda and various state agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with regulations  including manufacturing  testing  recordkeeping  quality control and labelling practices 
a determination that the company is in material violation of such regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company 
manufacturing and scale up 
the production of vaccines is a highly complex  biological process involving many steps  commencing from seed culture through final production 
the production process could fail at any point resulting in the failure and continued inability to meet production requirements 
from time to time  the company experiences disruptions and production failures and there are no assurances that the steps taken by the company to address such failures will be effective or that such failures will not continue in the future or affect the company s ability to obtain regulatory approval for its products or the timing of such approval or affect the company s ability to produce vaccines 
no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in establishing and maintaining consistent manufacture and continuous commercial production of its vaccines in sufficient quantity and quality or that it will be capable of producing a competitively priced product for commercial sale 
patent protection and proprietary information 
the vaccine industry traditionally has placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products and processes 
the company believes that such protection will be an important factor in its success and may require the expenditure of substantial resources 
many companies  universities and research institutions have applied for and or obtained patents for vaccine products and technologies that may be competitive or inconsistent with those held by or licensed to the company 
no assurances can be given as to the degree and range of protection any patents will afford the company  that additional patents will be issued to the company  or as to the extent to which the company will be successful in avoiding any patents granted to others 
further  there can be no assurance that others have not or will not independently develop or otherwise properly gain access to technology or information that is substantially similar to that which is unpatented yet considered proprietary by the company 
the company also may desire or be required to obtain licenses from others in order to develop  produce and market commercially viable products effectively 
failure to obtain those licenses could have a significant adverse effect on the company s ability to commercialize its vaccine products 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  that the patents underlying such licenses will be valid and enforceable or that the proprietary nature of the unpatented technology underlying such licenses will remain proprietary 
there has been  and the company believes that there may be in the future  significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if the company becomes involved in such litigation  it could consume substantial resources 
competition and technological change 
competition in the vaccine industry is intense 
competitors of the company both in the united states and internationally include major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
many of these competitors are actively developing competing vaccines 
for example  in and  three competitors announced that their respective dtap vaccines were approved by the fda for use in infants and children 
one of those competitors also announced that the fda licensed a vaccine that combines by reconstitution that company s hib vaccine with its dtap vaccine for administration at months of age and that it continues to seek fda approval for administration at two  four and six months of age 
in addition  several competitors dtap vaccines and certain combination vaccines have been licensed for sale outside of the united states 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources  more extensive experience in conducting clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  greater operating experience  larger research and development and marketing staffs  and greater production capabilities than those of the company 
in addition  the vaccine industry is subject to significant technological change 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in designing around the company s patents  developing technologies and products that are as or more effective than any that have been or are being developed by the company  or developing technologies and products that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and noncompetitive 
product liability  limited insurance 
the testing and marketing of vaccine products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
although the company has limited product liability insurance coverage  it intends to seek additional insurance coverage as it commences commercialization of its products 
there can be no assurance that adequate additional insurance coverage will be available at acceptable cost  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not materially adversely affect the business or financial condition of the company 
to the extent the company is not covered by insurance  the company faces potential liability that could be substantial in the event of claims 
lack of profitability 
the company s accumulated deficit  as of december  was approximately million  and the company presently has limited revenues 
the company expects to incur additional losses until such time as the company makes significant commercial sales of its dtap product 
the company s ability to achieve and maintain profitability is dependent upon its ability to develop products that are effective and commercially viable  to continue to obtain regulatory approvals for production and sale of its products  and to produce and market its products successfully 
there can be no assurance that the company will become profitable 
availability of capital 
it is anticipated that the company will continue to expend significant amounts of capital to fund its operations and capital expenditures 
the company plans to finance its cash requirements through a combination of cash and cash equivalents  revenues from product sales and from license  collaboration  marketing  distribution and or development agreements  the exercise of stock options  the sale of debt and or equity securities  mortgage financing  and equipment leases 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to satisfy its funding requirements from any of these alternatives or that it will be effective in reducing cash requirements for operations if fda approval is not timely received 
see item selected consolidated financial data  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
dependence on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
the company s success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the company 
dividends and taxation 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock 
the company currently intends to retain earnings  if any  to finance the growth and development of its business and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
moreover  any profits earned by the us subsidiary of the company will not be distributable directly to the company s shareholders 
instead  such subsidiary must declare and pay a dividend to the company  and the company in turn must declare a dividend to its shareholders 
this will subject each dividend to a withholding tax

impact of becoming a passive foreign investment company 
if more than a certain percentage of the company s assets or income become passive  the company will be classified for us tax purposes as a passive foreign investment company pfic  and a us taxpayer may be subject to an additional federal income tax on receiving certain dividends from the company or selling the company s common stock

voting control by principal shareholders 
the principal shareholders of the company  biochem and dr 
phillip frost  either directly or through affiliates  are parties to a shareholders agreement requiring  among other things  that the company s common stock covered by the agreement be voted together for the election of directors 
as of january   these principal shareholders beneficially owned approximately  shares of the company s outstanding common stock  which represented approximately of the company s then outstanding common stock 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
volatility of stock price 
the market prices for securities of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including the company  have been highly volatile 
many factors have historically had  and are expected to continue to have  a significant impact on the company s business and on the market price of the company s securities including announcements by the company and others regarding the results of regulatory approval filings  clinical trials or other testing  technological innovations or new commercial products by the company or its competitors  government regulations  developments concerning proprietary rights  public concern as to safety of vaccine and pharmaceutical products  and economic or other external factors 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock in the public market following the exercise of options or the conversion of convertible securities could have an adverse effect on the price of the company s securities 
to the extent that either of the two principal shareholder groups determines to sell a substantial number of their shares of the company s common stock  such sales could significantly increase the volatility of the market price of the issued and outstanding securities of the company 
in addition  one of the principal shareholders holds certain registration rights concerning shares of the company s common stock that it owns

background the company is engaged in the research  development  production  marketing and sale of vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases in children and adults 
in february  the swedish ministry of health granted regulatory approval to market the company s acellular pertussis vaccine formulated as a combined dtap vaccine for the prevention of diphtheria  tetanus  and pertussis whooping cough 
this marketing authorization was the first regulatory approval for any of the company s products 
in september  the danish national board of health granted regulatory approval to market a combined dtap ipv vaccine for all primary and booster doses for infants and children in denmark 
this combination vaccine  which combines the dtap vaccine with an enhanced  inactivated polio vaccine ipv developed jointly by statens seruminstitut ssi and the company 
under a supply agreement  the company manufactures the acellular component of the vaccine  and ssi manufactures the diphtheria  tetanus and ipv components and markets and distributes the dtap vaccine in sweden and the dtap ipv in denmark 
in addition  upon receipt of any required regulatory approvals  ssi will market and distribute such products in the scandinavian  baltic and other countries comprising its territory ssi s territory 
accordingly  the company has been selling its acellular pertussis toxoid to ssi for formulation into dtap and dtap ipv for sale in ssi territory 
in and  the company recognized development revenues pursuant to agreements with pasteur merieux connaught  under which the company and pasteur merieux connaught will jointly develop the company s meningococcus b vaccine 
additional funding may be provided to the company by pasteur merieux connaught under the terms of the license and clinical development agreements 
see liquidity and capital resources  below 
in the fourth quarter of  the company and abbott laboratories abbott signed an agreement under which abbott would market certiva 
trademark  the company s dtap vaccine  when approved by the fda 
the marketing agreement also will allow abbott to market the company s dtap hib  dtap ipv and dtap ipv hib combination vaccines  which are under development 
abbott will market certiva 
trademark 
and the combination vaccines to private physicians and managed care markets in the united states for immunization of infants and children 
the company will market certiva 
trademark 
and the combination vaccines to government purchasers  including state governments and the cdc 
on execution of the agreement with abbott  the company received million of which million represented payment for  shares of the company s common stock  and the balance represented a marketing fee and a clinical development payment 
the company and abbott will collaborate in the clinical development of the combination vaccines and abbott will provide the company with clinical development funding 
the company will receive payments upon achievement of prescribed milestones 
the agreement provides for total payments of up to million by abbott 
the first milestone relates to fda approval of certiva 
trademark 
provided certain other conditions are satisfied 
in addition  the company will receive revenues from abbott as it purchases certiva 
trademark 
and the combination vaccine products for resale to the private pediatric market 
in september  the company filed a product license application with the fda for approval to market certiva 
trademark 
and fda approval for the vaccine is pending 
during the fourth quarter of  the clinical data on certiva 
trademark 
was presented to and reviewed by the fda s vaccine and related biological products advisory committee the fda advisory committee 
the fda advisory committee  after the presentation of the data and discussion  concluded that certiva 
trademark 
is safe and effective for administration at   and months of age 
in addition  the fda advisory committee concluded that the data supported concurrent administration with polio  haemophilus influenzae type b  hepatitis b and measles mumps rubella vaccines  which are all recommended for immunization during the first two years of life 
the fda advisory committee raised no concerns regarding the adequacy of the data regarding the use of certiva 
trademark 
for the booster dose given to children at years of age following primary immunization using the whole cell pertussis vaccine 
additional data is required to support use at years of age following four consecutive doses of certiva 
trademark 
the fda advisory committee commented on the adequacy of the data regarding the use of the vaccine for the booster dose given to toddlers at months of age following the primary immunization using the whole cell pertussis vaccine 
in response to those comments  the company intends to supplement the data presented at the fda advisory committee meeting and additional data for this matter may be addressed in post marketing studies 
the company does not believe that any additional clinical studies will be required in connection with its product license application  other than the standard post licensure testing and surveillance for continued monitoring of the vaccine 
this is a forward looking statement and the necessity for any additional clinical studies for licensure of certiva 
trademark 
depends in large measure upon the fda s requirements 
the conclusions of the fda advisory committee are not binding on the fda 
in addition  three competitors announced in and that their respective dtap vaccines were approved by the fda for use in infants and children

the foregoing is a forward looking statement 
there are no assurances that the company will meet the projections for cash requirements for operations  that any further regulatory approvals will be received as projected  that the milestones described above will be achieved  or that  if such milestones are obtained  they will contribute materially to the quarterly cash requirements

during  the government of sweden granted marketing authorization for the company s acellular pertussis vaccine formulated as a combined dtap vaccine and the government of denmark granted marketing authorization for the company s acellular pertussis vaccine formulated as a combined dtap ipv vaccine 
ssi is responsible for marketing and distributing these products in ssi s territory 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company executed a supply and distribution agreement with chiron behring behring covering the company s dtap and dtap ipv vaccines for germany and austria behring s territory 
the company therefore anticipates revenues during from the continued sale of its acellular pertussis component to ssi for its sale of the dtap and the dtap ipv vaccines in ssi s territory 
any additional product approvals granted to ssi could lead to increased revenues from the sale of the company s acellular pertussis vaccine 
additional revenues may be forthcoming from sale of the dtap and or dtap ipv vaccines to behring in anticipation of or following regulatory approval for one or both of these products in the behring territory 
there are no assurances that further product approvals will be obtained in these territories during or at all  or that once obtained ssi or behring will be effective in the marketing and distribution of the products 
the company does not control the marketing and distribution efforts of ssi or behring in their respective territories and  therefore  the company s revenues for product sales in those territories are dependent upon the effectiveness of these parties sales  marketing and distribution efforts 
as described above  during  the company and abbott signed an agreement under which abbott would market certiva 
trademark 
and certain combination vaccines to private physicians and managed care markets in the united states for immunization of infants and children 
the company will market these products to government purchasers  including state governments and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 
the company filed a product license application for certiva 
trademark 
with the fda in september and fda approval is pending 
the company therefore anticipates revenues during from the sale of certiva 
trademark 
in the united states to state governments and the cdc  and to abbott for resale to private physicians and the managed care market 
if the product is launched successfully in the united states by the company and abbott  revenues from operations and the prospects for profitability would significantly increase 
there can be no assurance that the fda s approval will be obtained or that  once obtained  the company and or abbott will be effective in marketing and distributing the product 
the principal factors affecting the approval of certiva 
trademark 
and its timing are believed to be the sufficiency of the clinical trials design  the quality of the clinical data submitted to the fda  and the adequacy of the manufacturing facilities and operations for the product  among other things 
the factors affecting successful commercial launch of certiva 
trademark 
in the united states include  among others successfully participating in established purchasing programs of federal and state governments  establishing an identity and reputation for the company and its products  creating an awareness among pediatricians of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine  distinguishing the company s product from that of its competitors  establishing the company as an effective and reliable supplier of vaccines  and establishing effective distribution channels 
in and  three competitors announced that their respective dtap vaccines were approved by the fda for use in infants and children 
one of those competitors also announced that the fda licensed a vaccine that combines by reconstitution that company s hib vaccine with its dtap vaccine for administration at months of age and that it continues to seek fda approval for administration at two  four and six months of age 
in addition  several competitors dtap vaccines and certain combination vaccines have been licensed for sale outside of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company and its distributors will attain sufficient market share for the company s products at satisfactory sales price levels 
approval of certiva 
trademark 
for commercial introduction requires that the fda issue a license for the product and a license for the production facilities

the production process could fail at any point resulting in the failure and inability to meet production requirements 
from time to time  the company experiences disruptions and production failures  and there are no assurances that the steps taken by the company to address such failures will be effective or that such failures will not continue in the future or affect the company s ability to obtain regulatory approval for its products or the timing of such approval or affect the company s ability to produce vaccines 
moreover  there are no assurances that the company will be able to successfully establish and maintain consistent manufacture and continuous commercial production of its vaccines in sufficient quantity and quality or that it will be capable of producing a competitively priced product for commercial sale

research development  licensing and marketing agreements 
in december  the company signed a clinical development agreement and license agreement with pasteur merieux connaught under which the parties agreed to jointly develop its new conjugate vaccine against meningococcus b infection for both adults and pediatric indications 
in and  the company recognized revenue from pasteur merieux connaught under this collaboration 
future fees and funding would be made upon achievement of development  clinical and regulatory milestones 
total remaining fees and payments to the company upon achievement of all clinical and regulatory milestones amount to million 
the first milestone is the satisfactory completion of a pre clinical study 
in addition  the license agreement must be ratified by the national research council of canada nrc 
successful completion of the milestone and ratification of the license by the nrc would trigger a payment from pasteur merieux connaught 
the time it may take to achieve future milestones cannot be predicted accurately and there are no assurances that any milestone will be met during or at all or that the nrc will ratify the license agreement 
in addition  pasteur merieux connaught may terminate these agreements in its sole discretion at any time 
under the marketing and distribution agreement with abbott  the company will receive during clinical development payments aggregating million on dates certain and milestone payments upon achievement of prescribed clinical and regulatory events 
the first milestone relates to fda approval of certiva 
trademark 
provided certain other conditions are satisfied 
total remaining payments by abbott to the company under the agreements  inclusive of payments expected during  amount to million 
in addition  the company will receive revenues from abbott as it purchases certiva 
trademark 
and the combination vaccine products for resale to the private pediatric market 
there are no assurances that the milestones will be met  that the quantities of abbott s purchases of certiva 
trademark 
will be significant or as to the timing of such purchases  or that abbott will not exercise its right to terminate this arrangement at any time with advance notice 
during  the company anticipates that license fees  clinical development funding and milestone payments under its existing agreements will range from million to approximately million 
this is a forward looking statement and the factors that affect the timing of the license fee and milestone payments are in large measure outside of the control of the company 
the revenue recognized by the company from clinical development payments received from abbott will be equal to the company s expenditures in the clinical development program for certiva 
trademark 
and the combination vaccines up to a specified amount 
accordingly  such revenues are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and would have no effect on net operating results 
the factors that affect the timing of these expenditures  and therefore the revenues to be recognized therefrom  are subject to uncertainties related to clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
there are no assurances that the clinical development funding from abbott will be sufficient to fund all of the company s expenditures in the clinical development program for certiva 
trademark 
and the combination vaccines 
the company is considering the advisability of executing further distribution agreements for certain markets throughout the world 
the company also intends to collaborate in the development of selected vaccine products and may enter into additional collaborative development agreements similar in nature to that which was signed with pasteur merieux connaught  as described above 
in addition  the company is in various stages of discussions with third parties regarding various business arrangements including licensing  joint venture  acquisition  and other business agreements  some of which possibly may be concluded in the near term 
there are no assurances that the company will successfully negotiate and sign any such agreements or that  if executed  the financial terms for any such agreement will be significant
