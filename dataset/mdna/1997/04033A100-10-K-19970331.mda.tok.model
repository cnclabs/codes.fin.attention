item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was formed in to engage in the discovery and development of novel pharmaceuticals based on intracellular signal transduction technology 
ariad is developing small molecule drugs to block signal transduction pathways in cells responsible for osteoporosis  immune and inflammatory diseases and cancer 
in addition  the company is developing a system using small molecule drugs that controls signal transduction pathways to provide a means of regulating therapeutic protein production in gene therapy 
ariad s signal transduction inhibitor and regulated gene therapy programs are supported by a broad drug discovery platform that includes highly integrated capabilities in functional genomics  molecular cell biology  structure based drug design  combinatorial chemistry and pharmacology 
since its inception in  the company has devoted substantially all of its resources to its research and development programs 
the company receives no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products and substantially all revenue to date has been received in connection with the company s research collaborations 
the company has not been profitable since inception and expects to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the expansion of its research and development programs  including the establishment of the genomics center 
the company expects that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  recent development in march  the company entered into a joint venture with hmr to pursue functional genomics with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic proteins and drug targets 
the genomics center will be located at the company s facilities in cambridge  massachusetts 
the company and hmr agreed to commit up to  including  to fund operating and related costs associated with the genomics center over an initial five year period and up to  in leasehold improvements and equipment to be funded by ariad 
hmr has committed to provide ariad with capital adequate to fund ariad s share of such costs through the purchase of up to  of series b preferred stock through the five year period  including an initial purchase of  shares of series b preferred stock for  on march  see liquidity and capital resources 
the company also entered into agreements with the genomics center to provide research and administrative services the services agreements to the genomics center on a cost reimbursement basis 
ariad s costs of providing the research and administrative services to the genomics center will be charged to research and development expense and general and administrative expense in its consolidated financial statements 
under the services agreements  ariad will bill the genomics center for of its costs of providing the research and administrative services  however  because ariad is providing of the funding of the genomics center  ariad will recognize as revenue only of the amounts billed 
accordingly  the company s operating losses will increase substantially as a result of the hmr genomics agreement 
ariad will account for its investment in the genomics center using the equity method 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue the company s research revenue under collaborative arrangements and government sponsored research grants was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases of  in compared to and  in compared to were primarily due to research revenue recognized under the company s hmr osteoporosis agreement  which commenced in november  which amounted to  in and  in research revenue for recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement includes  from the amortization of deferred revenue and  relating to the achievement of the first research milestone 
although research revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement is expected to remain substantially equivalent in  research revenue resulting from the services agreements with the genomics center is expected to increase over the next three years 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income decreased by  in compared to primarily as a result of lower levels of funds invested and increased by  in compared to as a result of higher yields on a lower level of average funds invested 
operating expenses research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased by  or in compared to due primarily to increased research activity as a result of the hmr osteoporosis agreement and decreased by  or in compared to due to a narrowing of the company s drug discovery focus to its signal transduction programs 
the company expects its research and development expenses to increase substantially over the next three years as a result of research services to be provided to the genomics center pursuant to the services agreements 
see liquidity and capital resources 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or in compared to primarily due to savings in insurance and legal expenses and increased by  or in compared to primarily due to higher legal expenses 
the company incurred interest expense of  in compared to  in and  in the decreases resulted from lower levels of long term debt offset somewhat in by higher interest rates 
operating results the company incurred losses before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  in   in and  in  or  
and per share  respectively 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as a result  the company recorded a cumulative effect which decreased the net loss in by  
per share 
after the cumulative effect  the company incurred a net loss in of  or per share 
the company expects that substantial operating losses will continue for several more years and will increase as its activities expand as a result of services provided to the genomics center and to the extent that the company s product candidates in research and development undergo preclinical studies and clinical trials 
operating losses are likely to fluctuate as a result of differences in the timing and composition of revenue earned and expenses incurred 
at december   the company had available for federal tax reporting purposes net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that expire commencing in the company also had federal research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately  that expire commencing in both the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits are subject to certain limitations under federal tax laws 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations and investments in property and equipment primarily through the private placement and public offering of its securities  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt  sale leaseback and capital lease transactions  interest income  government sponsored research grants and  commencing in november  research revenue under the hmr osteoporosis agreement 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  and working capital of  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  and working capital of  at december  the primary uses of cash during the year ended december  were  to finance the company s operations and working capital requirements   to purchase equipment   to acquire licensed technology and patent rights and  to repay long term debt 
during  the company received net proceeds of  from the sale leaseback of laboratory equipment 
in march  the company entered into a joint venture with hmr to pursue functional genomics with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic proteins and small molecule drug targets 
the company and hmr agreed to commit up to  including  to fund the operating and related costs associated with the genomics center over an initial five year period and up to  in leasehold improvements and equipment to be funded by ariad 
hmr has committed to provide ariad with capital adequate to fund ariad s share of such costs through the purchase of up to  of series b preferred stock through the five year period  including an initial investment of  as discussed below 
the company also entered into the services agreements with the genomics center to provide research and administrative services to the genomics center on a cost reimbursement basis 
pursuant to the hmr genomics agreement  on march   hmr purchased  shares of the company s series b preferred stock for  during the period from to  at the company s option  hmr has agreed to make subsequent purchases of up to  of series b preferred stock at purchase prices based on a premium to the market price of the common stock at the time of each subsequent purchase unless the market price of the common stock exceeds a predetermined ceiling  in which case the purchase price will be equal to the market price 
should ariad and hmr determine that the genomics center requires funds in excess of those committed  ariad may fund its share of the excess through a loan facility made available by hmr 
funds borrowed by ariad pursuant to such loan facility  if any  will bear interest at a rate of libor plus and are repayable by in cash or series b preferred stock  at the company s option 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with hmr to collaborate on the discovery and development of drugs to treat osteoporosis and related bone diseases  one of the company s signal transduction drug discovery programs 
under the terms of the hmr osteoporosis agreement  hmr made an initial cash payment to the company of  agreed to provide research funding in equal quarterly amounts of  up to an aggregate of  over a five year period and agreed to provide an aggregate of up to  upon the attainment of certain research milestones 
in addition  hmr has established a dedicated research group to collaborate with the company on the discovery of osteoporosis drugs and has agreed to fund all of the preclinical and clinical development costs for products that emerge from the collaboration 
the hmr osteoporosis agreement further provides for the payment of royalties to the company based on product sales 
hmr may elect to terminate the hmr osteoporosis agreement and further payment obligations after three years if certain scientific milestones have not been achieved  whereupon all rights would revert back to the company 
to date  revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement has amounted to  including  in relating to the achievement of the first research milestone which was included in accounts receivable at december the company has substantial fixed commitments under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt instruments 
such fixed commitments  excluding the company s funding obligations related to the genomics center  currently aggregate in excess of  per year and are likely to increase 
the company will require substantial additional funding for its research and product development programs  for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory clearances and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether obtained through financial markets or collaborative or other arrangements with collaborative partners  or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  funding from the hmr genomics agreement plus interest income and other sources will be adequate to satisfy its capital and operational requirements for the genomics center for the next five years and will be adequate to satisfy its other capital and operating requirements for at least the next two years 
however  there can be no assurance that changes in the company s research and development plans or other events affecting the company s operating expenses will not result in the earlier depletion of the company s funds
