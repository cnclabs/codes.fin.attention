operating divisions construction materials division the construction materials division produces and sells construction aggregates  hot mix asphalt  and ready mixed concrete for use in commercial and residential construction  public construction projects and projects to build  expand and repair roads and highways 
the division operates aggregates processing plants at locations in the major markets of southern and central california and the san francisco bay area  phoenix and tucson  arizona  and albuquerque  new mexico 
the division also operates asphalt plants at locations in the same markets as the aggregates processing plants  but in addition  also operates in the sacramento area 
of the hot mix locations  are sites which also have aggregates processing plants and or ready mixed concrete plants 
ready mixed concrete batch plants are operated at locations in the same markets as the aggregates plants  except for the los angeles and san francisco bay areas 
of the ready mixed concrete locations  are sites which also have aggregates processing plants 
as shown in the following table  aggregates and ready mixed concrete sales volumes increased from aggregates sales volumes increased in part because volumes were depressed by an organized labor strike in the los angeles market area 
volumes in decreased from  primarily due to the labor strike and record rainfall in california in early construction materials sales volumes amounts in thousands aggregates tons sold to outside customers    tons used in ready mixed concrete    tons used in asphalt    tons of hot mix asphalt sold    yards of ready mixed concrete sold    overall division revenue of million was up from s revenue of million  which was up from s revenue of million 
the increase in s revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes and average sales prices for aggregates and ready mixed concrete 
the increase in s revenues resulted from higher average sales prices for ready mixed concrete and asphalt and higher volumes for ready mixed concrete 
gross profit for aggregates in increased million due to the combination of higher sales volumes  higher average sales price and slightly lower unit production costs 
ready mixed concrete gross profit increased million in due to a increase in unit sales volumes and a increase in average sales price 
asphalt gross profit declined by million in  due to higher unit production costs  of which one half was the result of increased costs of liquid asphalt and natural gas 
in  the average sales price of aggregates was virtually unchanged from gross profit for aggregates in  excluding incremental out of pocket strike costs  decreased million due to the combination of a volume decline and higher unit production costs 
asphalt gross profit in  excluding incremental out of pocket strike costs  declined by million due to the combination of a volume decline and higher unit production costs  partially offset by a increase in average sales price

generally  the company s exposure has been limited to soil contamination from underground fuel tanks or fuel spillage rather than exposure resulting from generation of hazardous waste  although it is a named party at one federal superfund site 
the company conducts annual environmental assessments of each of its operating sites 
liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the company s commitment to a formal plan of action 
as investigation or remediation proceeds  and as the scope of the company s obligations become more clearly defined  there may be changes to estimated costs  which might result in future charges to earnings 
during  the company charged to income million before tax for environmental remediation costs and made related payments of million 
at december   the reserve for environmental remediation costs totaled million 
the amount reserved represents the estimated undiscounted costs which the company will incur to remediate sites with known contamination 
no potential insurance recoveries have been offset against the reserve 
substantially all amounts accrued are expected to be paid out over the next five years 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased million in  mainly due to proceeds received from a private placement of long term debt in cash and cash equivalents decreased million in compared to operating activities are the principal source of calmat s cash flows 
over the past three years  operating activities have provided million in cash 
net cash of million generated from operating activities in was million less than in net cash of million generated from operating activities in was essentially unchanged from cash used for investing activities totaled million in  a million decrease from the primary reasons for this change were the acquisition of the remainder of a business previously partially owned for million  decreases in installments notes receivable of million  decreased spending on property  plant and equipment of million  partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from sale of real estate of million 
cash used for investing activities totaled million in  a million increase from the level 
the primary reasons for this change were increased spending on property  plant and equipment of million  the acquisition of the remainder of a business previously partially owned for million  and increases in installment notes receivable of million 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in  a million increase from the million provided by financing activities during the primary reason for the increase is million in proceeds from issuance of senior notes in  offset by million in net payments on notes payable to banks in and million in payments on senior notes in net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in  a million change from the million used for financing activities during the primary reason for this change was a million net increase in notes payable in compared with million in net payments on notes payable in capital expenditures decreased in to million from million in capital expenditures increased in to million from million in  which was largely due to expansion projects  including the construction of mining and processing facilities located at irvine lake in orange county  california  two new asphalt plants in southern california and a portable aggregates crushing plant
