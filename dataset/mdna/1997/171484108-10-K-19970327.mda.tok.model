from january through october  the company opened off track wagering facilities in merrillville  fort wayne and downtown indianapolis  indiana 
the license for the fourth facility in jeffersonville  indiana was surrendered in july because ownership of the tentative site was in question and resolution was not expected in the near future 
the company is continuing to evaluate sites for the location of a fourth satellite wagering facility

churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued with the advent of whole card simulcasting  the company conducts interstate simulcasting virtually year round on multiple racing programs each day from around the nation 
the number of receiving days has increased in when compared to because of the indiana off track wagering facilities being open throughout during  simulcast wagering was being conducted at hoosier park in anderson  indiana and beginning january  at merrillville  indiana 
two additional simulcast facilities were opened during  one in ft 
wayne  indiana on april   and the other in indianapolis  indiana in october  simulcast wagering was conducted at all four facilities throughout the year ended december  for  the company has been granted a license to operate simulcast receiving locations in kentucky and indiana for any and all possible dates from january through december and intends to receive simulcasting on all possible days 
hoosier park may ultimately be supported by a fourth whole card simulcasting facility 
an increase in the number of days or facilities would be expected to enhance operating results 
because the business of the company is seasonal  the number of persons employed will vary throughout the year 
approximately individuals are employed on a permanent year round basis 
during the live race meetings  as many as  persons are employed 
in  there were four riverboats in operation along the ohio river  three in indiana and one at metropolis  illinois 
by  as many as five indiana riverboats may be operating along the ohio river  with one of the nation s largest complexes proposed to be located miles from louisville in harrison county  indiana 
direct competition with three newly opened riverboats has negatively impacted wagering at racetracks in western and northern kentucky 
decreases in intertrack wagering  and to some extent on track wagering  during churchill downs fall meet were the result of riverboat competition in these markets 
the company believes that competition from indiana riverboat gaming facilities will have a negative impact on the company s operations  which could be material 
in addition  licenses allowing up to five riverboat casinos on lake michigan near the company s merrillville  indiana  sports spectrum facility have been granted by the indiana gaming commission 
the potawatomi indian tribe has expressed an interest in establishing a land based casino operation in southwestern michigan and northeastern indiana  while the miami indian tribe has expressed an interest in establishing a land based casino near the company s merrillville sports spectrum 
the company anticipates that the commencement of such operations will have a negative impact upon the company s wagering activities 
the extent of the impact is unknown at this time due  in part  to the uncertain geographic distances between the company s operations and the number of potential casino sites 
churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued studies project that direct competition with these boats could result in as much as a decline in on track wagering at churchill downs and a decline in sports spectrum business 
in response  the company s board of directors passed a resolution at its june  meeting instructing the company s management to aggressively pursue alternative forms of gaming at its racetrack facilities in louisville 
the integration of alternative gaming products at the racetrack is one of four core business strategies developed by the company to grow its live racing program 
management has been positioning the company to compete in this changing environment for the past several years by strengthening its flagship operations  increasing its share of the interstate simulcast market  and geographically expanding its racing operations into indiana 
the company is pursuing legislative initiatives in both kentucky and indiana which would allow alternative gaming operations at its racetrack facilities 
alternative gaming in the form of video lottery and slot machines would enable churchill downs and hoosier park to effectively compete with indiana riverboat casinos  and provide new revenue for capital investment and purse money

net revenue also increased by million in due to riverboat admissions taxes from indiana riverboat gaming
