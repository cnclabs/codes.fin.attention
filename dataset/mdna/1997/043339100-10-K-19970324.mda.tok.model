in addition to the increased volume  the company s oe markets continued a trend toward higher quality  higher valued original equipment parts  which contributed approximately percent of the increase 
coated steel and other component automotive parts posted modest volume increases when compared with the prior year

volume increases and the positive effect on product mix as a result of a more complex product line were the primary drivers of the increase

as in the oe segment  there is also a certain degree of imprecision and subjectivity in estimating the impact of period to period volume changes  principally because of questions as to what constitutes a unit for volume measurement 
the appropriate measure of a unit varies over time as products develop  varies among the different countries in which the company operates  and varies within each operating unit of the company
