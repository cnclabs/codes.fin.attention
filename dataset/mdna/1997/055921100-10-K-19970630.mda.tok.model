item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction this discussion comprises historical information for the periods covered  followed by certain forward looking information and information about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s future operating results to differ from results indicated by any forward looking statements made by the company or others 
it is important that the historical discussion be read together with the discussion of such risks and uncertainties  and that these discussions are read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements and notes thereto 
historical information results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings bear to total revenues 
percentage of total revenues year ended march  revenues licenses maintenance total revenues selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses general and administrative expenses acquired research and development costs operating income other income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings net earnings  excluding acquired research and development costs earnings fiscal s total revenues of  were higher than fiscal total revenues 
the increase was the result of a increase in north american product license revenues  a increase in international product license revenues and a increase in worldwide maintenance revenues 
net earnings in fiscal were  excluding a one time write off of  net of income taxes related to the first quarter acquisitions of assets of certain technology companies 
these results represent a increase over fiscal net earnings of  excluding the acquired research and development charge related to acquisitions of technology 
increased net earnings were attributable to the total revenue growth and the reduction in acquired research and development costs 
operating income as a percentage of revenues operating margins has increased slightly from fiscal to  however  there can be no assurance that operating margins will be sustained at historical levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the heading forward looking information and certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
revenues percentage change fiscal year ended march  compared to compared to in thousands perpetual licenses north america    international    total perpetual licenses    maintenance    total revenues    the company generates revenues from the licensing of its computer software products and fees for the associated maintenance  enhancement and support of these products 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with statement of position  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
for further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policies  refer to note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at march   the company marketed over software products designed to improve the availability  reliability  accuracy and or integrity of enterprise data maintained in ibm mainframe and client server computing environments 
the mainframe based products accounted for approximately  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the revenues from these products are driven largely by the growth in customers processing capacity  as discussed below 
from to  total revenues from mainframe based products grew and from to  total revenues from these products grew 
the company s mainframe based revenues are heavily concentrated in its high performance utilities and administrative tools for ibm s ims and db database management systems 
the ims database utilities contributed  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively  and the masterplan for db product series contributed  and of total revenues for the same periods 
combined revenues for these product lines grew from fiscal to and from fiscal to the balance of the company s mainframe products represented  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the declines in relative revenue contribution by each of these product lines reflect the increased contribution by the company s client server products in these periods 
revenues from client server products grew from to and from to client server product revenues are driven primarily by the company s patrol management series  the patrol db database administration series formerly the metasuite family of products and the sql backtrack database backup and recovery products from datatools  inc  datatools for whom the company acted as an exclusive distributor during fiscal and the patrol management product line accounted for  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the patrol db database administration product line  introduced in fiscal  accounted for less than and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
total revenues from the patrol management product lines grew from fiscal to and from fiscal to total revenues from the patrol db product line grew from fiscal to the company entered into an exclusive distributorship arrangement with datatools on march  subsequent to march   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of datatools and has begun the process of fully integrating the sql backtrack products into the patrol recovery manager product lines 
from fiscal to fiscal  total sql backtrack product revenues grew 
the revenues from the company s client server product offerings are dependent upon the continued market acceptance of the company s existing products and the company s ability to successfully develop and deliver additional products for the client server environment 
the company has experienced rapid growth in its client server product lines since their introduction late in fiscal year the client server market is much more competitive and volatile than the mainframe market  however  and there can be no assurance that this growth will continue 
license revenues the company s license revenues include product license fees  restructuring fees and capacity based license upgrade fees 
product license fees are generated from the initial licensing of a product and subsequent licenses purchased under the company s tier based licensing program 
restructuring fees increase the discounts used to calculate future maintenance and upgrade charges for a customer s installed products 
capacity based license upgrade fees are charged when a customer acquires the right to run an already licensed product on additional processing capacity  which may be measured traditionally by central processing unit cpu tier or by the aggregate processing capacity measured in millions of instructions per second mips on which the company s products are installed 
these license upgrade fees include fees associated with currently installed additional processing capacity and fees associated with a customer s licensing products to operate with anticipated future processing capacity 
the company s north american operations generated of total license revenues in fiscal and in fiscal north american license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal increased sales of the company s client server products represented a significant part of north american license revenue growth in both fiscal years and represented the largest single component of license revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  the largest single component of north american license revenue growth was increased license upgrade fees associated with customers future mainframe processing capacity 
international license revenues represented and of total license revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
international license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal international license revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal was derived principally from upgrade fees associated with future additional processing capacity and  to a lesser extent  from product license sales of mainframe and client server products 
from fiscal to fiscal  the principal contributors to growth in international license revenues were mainframe product license fees and license upgrade fees associated with customers currently required additional mainframe processing capacity 
international license revenues increased approximately from the weakening of the dollar from fiscal to fiscal and decreased approximately from the strengthening of the dollar from fiscal to fiscal capacity based upgrade fees include fees for both current and future additional processing capacity 
these fees accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the sustainability and growth of the company s mainframe based license revenues are dependent upon these capacity based upgrade fees  particularly within its largest customer accounts 
most of the company s largest customers have entered into enterprise license agreements allowing them to install the company s products on an unspecified number of cpus  subject to a maximum limit on the aggregate power of the cpus as measured in mips 
substantially all of these transactions include upgrade charges associated with additional processing capacity beyond the customer s current usage level and or a restructuring fee  and some include license fees for additional products 
in fiscal  and  the enterprise license fees for future additional processing capacity and license restructurings comprised approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
the fees associated with future additional mainframe processing capacity typically comprise from one half to substantially all of the license fees included in the enterprise license transaction 
over the past two fiscal years  the company has experienced a marked increase in demand from its largest customers for current and anticipated mainframe processing capacity  and the company expects that it will continue to be dependent upon these license revenue components 
with the rapid advancement of client server technology and customers needs for more functional and open applications to replace legacy systems  however  there can be no assurance that the demand for mainframe processing capacity will continue at current levels 
should this trend slow dramatically or reverse  it would adversely impact the company s mainframe based license revenues and operating results 
maintenance and support revenues maintenance and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of customers prepaid fees entitling them to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems and applications 
maintenance and support charges are generally to of the list price of the product at the time of renewal  less any applicable discounts 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for first year maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement 
the company continues to invest heavily in product maintenance and support and believes that maintaining its reputation for superior product support is a key component of its value pricing model 
maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase in proportion to the processing capacity on which the products are installed  consequently  the company receives higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install its products on additional processing capacity 
due to increased discounting at higher levels of future mips licensing  however  the maintenance fees per mips are often reduced in enterprise license agreements 
historically  the company has enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for its mainframe based products 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to the company s products  however  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of the company s maintenance revenues 
to date  the company has been successful in extending its traditional maintenance and support pricing model to the client server market 
at this time  there is insufficient historical data to determine whether customers will continue to accept this pricing model and renew their maintenance and support contracts at the levels experienced in the mainframe market 
other income other income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  financed receivables and marketable securities 
other income increased by from fiscal to and from fiscal to the increase in other income is primarily due to higher interest income earned on larger invested cash balances expenses percentage changes fiscal year ended march  compared to compared to in thousands selling and marketing    research and development    cost of maintenance services and product licenses    general and administrative    acquired research and development    total operating expenses    selling and marketing the company s selling and marketing expenses comprise primarily personnel and related costs  sales commissions and costs associated with advertising  industry trade shows and sales seminars 
compensation costs were the largest single contributor to the expense growth in fiscal and fiscal due to the continued hiring of sales and marketing personnel to promote and sell the company s increasing number of product offerings 
selling and marketing headcount increased by from march  to march  sales commissions increased in fiscal and in fiscal as a result of the and increases  respectively  in license revenues 
due to productivity improvements and commission plan changes  however  the commission increases were lower than the growth in license revenues 
also  marketing costs have continued to increase to meet the requirements of marketing a greater number of increasingly complex client server products and of supporting a growing and relatively new indirect distribution channel 
the primary factors contributing to increased selling and marketing expenses from fiscal to were increased compensation costs and sales commissions 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling and marketing expenses have increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal research and development research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel 
these expenses also include computer hardware software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain the company s data processing center 
the company s net research and development expenditures during fiscal increased by over fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in software developers and development support personnel  especially in the client server area 
the company increased its headcount in the research and development organization by over from fiscal year end to fiscal year end the company s net research and development expenses in fiscal increased by only over fiscal although the company s investment in research and development activities during fiscal was greater than the indicated growth because of higher software capitalization costs 
a portion of the company s research and development expenditures were capitalized as software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in all three fiscal years 
during fiscal  and  the company capitalized approximately   and  respectively of software development costs 
the substantial growth in capitalized costs during fiscal was due to increases in client server product development and  to a lesser degree  the development of mainframe software products that had reached the stage of development where the costs were capitalizable under sfas no 
excluding the effects of capitalized software on research and development expenses  the growth in research and development from fiscal to fiscal occurred primarily in increased personnel and related costs 
research and development expenditures  as a percentage of sales  have decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal and cost of maintenance services and product licenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses consists of compensation for technical employees providing customer support  amortization of both purchased and internally developed software and royalty fees paid to third parties 
the increase in cost of maintenance services and product licenses is mainly due to increases in customer support employees and royalty fees  primarily those paid to datatools 
the company acquired datatools in may of refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
royalty fees were not incurred by the company prior to fiscal the company amortized   and  in fiscal  and  respectively of capitalized software development costs pursuant to sfas no 
 including   and  respectively  to accelerate the amortization of certain software products 
these software products were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues which would be required for the company to realize the carrying value of the assets 
the company expects its cost of maintenance services and product licenses to continue increasing as the company capitalizes a higher level of software development costs and as the company builds its client server product support organization  which is less cost effective than its mainframe support organization because of the complexity and variability of the environments in which the products operate 
growth in cost of maintenance services and product licenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to amortization of both purchased and internally developed software and royalty fees 
with the acquisition of datatools in may of  the company believes that royalty fees in fiscal should be reduced over fiscal levels 
as a percentage of total revenues  cost of maintenance services and product licenses was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  product distribution and fulfillment and human resources 
other expenses included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal services  accounting services  consulting projects  insurance  travel and costs of managing the company s foreign currency exposure 
growth in general and administrative expenses in fiscal and fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs  professional fees  management bonuses and costs associated with managing the company s foreign currency exposure 
the increased personnel costs primarily relate to the company s continued infrastructure development 
headcount within the general and administrative organizations grew by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal growth in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to personnel costs and costs associated with managing the company s foreign currency exposure 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses remained constant at in fiscal years  and acquired research and development in the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired certain technology assets and certain in process technologies for an aggregate purchase price of  including direct acquisition costs 
the company funded these acquisitions with cash 
the company accounted for these transactions using the purchase method of accounting and recorded a  charge  net of a  income tax benefit  for acquired research and development costs during the first quarter 
as of march   approximately  of such consideration had not been paid and was included in accrued liabilities 
the company completed various technology acquisitions during fiscal the aggregate purchase price for these transactions totaled  including direct acquisition costs 
the company funded these acquisitions primarily through the issuance of its own common stock  and to a lesser extent  with cash 
the company used the purchase method of accounting for these technology acquisitions 
the company recorded a  charge  net of an income tax benefit of  for acquired research and development costs during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed the acquisitions of stock and assets including in process research and development of several technology companies for an aggregate purchase price of  including warrants to purchase the company s stock valued at approximately  and direct acquisition costs 
also  as of march   the company obtained exclusive product distribution rights and a purchase option from datatools for  the term of the company s option was march  through march  the company exercised its option and acquired datatools on may  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company accounted for all of the acquisition transactions discussed above using the purchase method and recorded a  charge  net of an income tax benefit of  for acquired research and development costs  during the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rates were  and for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency rate fluctuations for the fiscal years ended march  and  and  respectively of the company s consolidated revenues were derived from customers outside north america 
substantially all of the company s sales outside north america are billed and collected in foreign currencies 
substantially all of the expenses of operating the company s foreign subsidiaries and compensating its independent agents are similarly incurred in foreign currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results are affected by fluctuations of those foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the company has adopted a foreign currency hedging strategy designed to reduce its foreign currency transaction exposures 
for the years ended march   and currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk management the functional currency for most of the company s international subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates 
changes in exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar may negatively affect the company s sales as expressed in us dollars and gross profit margins from the international operations 
the company monitors this currency risk and attempts to mitigate the exposure through hedging transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
specifically  with respect to future revenues  the company utilizes put options to protect the majority of anticipated foreign exchange denominated revenues  primarily those denominated in german deutschemarks and british pounds 
the term of the option contracts is rarely more than one year 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments  specifically  accounts receivable  intercompany transactions  cash balances and certain liabilities 
the term of the forward contracts is generally days 
the currencies hedged include several european currencies  as well as the japanese yen and australian dollar 
pursuant to sfas no 
 sfas no 
 sfas no 
and related literature  the company applies hedge accounting treatment to all of its hedging transactions ie  such instruments are effective as and are designated as hedge instruments 
specifically  gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized at each month end in connection with the translation of the related hedged exposure into us dollars 
gains and premiums associated with purchased put options are deferred until their maturity or until they are exercised or when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur 
all gains and losses attributable to the company s current hedging strategy are expected to occur within one year from the reporting date 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial instruments  but it does not expect any such counterparties to fail to meet their obligations  given their high credit ratings 
in addition  the company diversifies this risk across several counterparties 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in fiscal sfas no 
established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based compensation plans 
the company adopted the disclosure method as permitted by sfas no 
and  therefore  its reported financial results were not changed by this accounting standard

see forward looking information and certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were  the company s working capital as of march   was  the company continues to invest cash in securities with longer maturities yielding higher returns 
this has the impact of reducing working capital 
the company s securities are investment grade and highly liquid 
the company had no debt as of march   other than normal trade payables  accrued liabilities and taxes payable 
stockholders equity as of march   was  the company continues to finance its growth through funds generated from operations 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  primarily related to the acquisition of computers and related equipment  the purchase of investment securities and the technology acquisitions discussed above 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was  the primary uses of cash generated from operations pertained to the company s stock repurchase program and to purchases of investment securities 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  as of march   the company was authorized to acquire  shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that complement the company s strategic plans 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
forward looking information and certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results this annual report and management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition include certain forward looking statements  which are identified by the use of the words believes  expects and similar expressions that contemplate future events 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect the company s operating results and could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of the company 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
these important factors  risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those described in the following paragraphs and in the discussion above in this annual report under the heading business  including  without limitation  the discussion under the subheading competition  system dependence 
the company s stock price has historically been highly volatile 
future revenues  earnings and stock prices may be subject to wide swings  particularly on a quarterly basis  in response to variations in operating and financial results  anticipated revenue and or earnings growth rates and other factors 
the stock price of software companies in general  and the company in particular  is based on expectations of future revenue and earnings growth 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue and earnings levels in a period would likely have a significant adverse effect on the company s stock price 
the timing and amount of the company s license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
the company generally operates with little or no sales backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent upon contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
most of the company s sales are closed at the end of each quarter  and there has been and continues to be a trend toward larger enterprise license transactions  which can have sales cycles of up to a year or more and require approval by a customer s upper management 
these transactions are typically difficult to manage and predict 
failure to close an expected individually significant transaction could cause the company s revenues and earnings in a period to fall short of expectations 
other factors that may cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues include competition  industry or technological trends  customer budgetary decisions  mainframe processing capacity growth  general economic conditions or uncertainties  mainframe industry pricing and other trends  announcements of new hardware or software products and the timing of price increases 
the company generally does not know whether revenues and earnings will meet expected results until the final days or day of a quarter 
the company s operating expenses are to a large extent fixed in the short term so that the company has very limited ability to adjust its planned expenses if revenues fail to meet expectations 
operating margins have increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  which is at the high end of the range for peer companies 
the company does not expect future margin expansion 
further  since research and development  sales  support and distribution costs for client server software products are generally higher than for mainframe products  operating margins will experience more pressure as the mix of the company s business continues its shift to client server revenues 
the company is continuing to develop indirect channel relationships to increase its coverage and presence in a cost effective manner 
there can be no assurance  however  that this strategy will be successful 
the company continues to make progress in implementing reseller and distribution arrangements  and client server indirect sales in fiscal approximated  if the company s direct sales force remains the primary channel for its client server products  its selling and marketing expenses could increase and operating margins could be reduced 
the company has historically realized greater revenues and net earnings in the latter half of its fiscal year  the quarter ending december coincides with the end of customers annual budgetary periods and the quarter ending march coincides with the end of the company s annual sales plans and fiscal year 
for the same reasons  the company has typically reported lower or flat revenues in the first two quarters of a fiscal year than in the last two quarters of the previous year  resulting in lower operating margins in the first two quarters 
the company historically has generated greater revenues in the third and fourth quarters while maintaining lower rates of expense growth and expanded operating margins 
past financial performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance  and there can be no assurances that this pattern will be maintained 
future operating results are also dependent on sustained performance improvement by the company s international offices 
in this regard  the economy in europe has been somewhat depressed in the past year  with relatively high unemployment 
the company s operations and financial results could be significantly adversely affected by issues such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
many systems and applications software vendors are experiencing difficulties internationally  particularly in europe 
the country whose results have been and are expected to be the most significant to the company s overall results is germany  which accounted for over of total international revenues in each of the prior three fiscal years 
the company derived approximately of its revenues in fiscal from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers 
ibm continues to focus on reducing the overall software costs associated with the os mainframe platform 
further  ibm continues  directly and through third parties  to enhance its utilities for ims and db to provide lower cost alternatives to those provided by the company and other independent software vendors 
the company has traditionally maintained sufficient performance and functional advantages over ibm s base utilities  although there can be no assurance that it will continue to maintain such advantages 
fees from enterprise license transactions remain fundamental components of the company s revenues 
in fiscal and  enterprise license fees for future additional processing capacity and license restructurings comprised approximately of total revenues 
these revenues are dependent upon the company s customers continuing to perceive an increasing need to use the company s existing software products on substantially greater mainframe processing capacity in future periods 
the company believes that the demand for enterprise licenses has been driven by customers re commitment over the last to months to the os mainframe platform for large scale  transaction intensive information systems 
whether this trend will continue is difficult to predict 
if the company s customers processing capacity growth were to slow and or if such customers were to perceive alternatives to relying upon the company s current mainframe products  the company s revenues would be adversely impacted 
capacity based upgrade fees associated with both current and future processing capacity contributed  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and the increase in these fees is largely the result of customers acquiring the right to run the company s products on mips levels which are in excess of their current environments 
the charging of upgrade fees based on cpu tier classifications is standard among mainframe systems software vendors  including ibm 
the pricing of mainframe systems software  including the charging of tier based upgrade fees or other capacity based fees  is under continued pressure from customers 
although the company has adopted mips based pricing for enterprise licenses  it has not significantly changed the fact that customers pay more to use its products on more powerful cpus 
the company believes its current pricing policies properly reflect the value provided by its products 
ibm provides alternatives to tier based pricing with respect to its large mainframe cpus and is attempting to reduce the costs of its mainframe systems software to increase the overall cost competitiveness of its mainframe hardware and software products 
these actions have increased pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets 
the company s growth prospects are dependent upon the success of its existing client server products and those anticipated to be introduced in the future 
the company has experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of its client server products  and expects to have delays in the future 
delays in new mainframe or client server product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and earnings 
new products or new versions of existing products may  despite testing  contain undetected errors or bugs that will delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products 
the enterprise systems management market that the company s client server products address is characterized by rapid change and intense competition that continues to increase as vendors within the broader markets converge 
certain of the company s competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than the company and greater experience in client server development and sales 
a key factor in determining the success of the company s products  particularly its client server offerings  will be their ability to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading database management systems and other systems software products supported by the company s products 
while the company believes its products that address this market  including those under development  will compete effectively  this market will be relatively unpredictable over the next few years and there can be no assurance that anticipated results will be achieved 
microsoft corporation has significantly increased its focus on developing operating systems  systems management products and databases that will provide business critical class functionality 
specifically  microsoft is aggressively promoting its backoffice tm family of software products  including its windows nt server operating system and its sql server relational database management system  as lower cost alternatives to the unix operating systems coupled with relational database management systems from oracle corporation  sybase  inc  informix corporation and other vendors 
microsoft could significantly lower software price points in some of the company s markets  which could place additional pricing pressure on the company 
the company has invested and intends to continue to invest in the development of systems management products for windows nt and backoffice environments  but there are numerous uncertainties associated with the company s ability to successfully execute this strategy 
litigation seeking to enforce patents  copyrights and trade secrets is increasing in the software industry 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert that their patent or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by the company 
any such claims  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows
