item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual experience may differ materially from that discussed in such statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors contained in exhibit hereto  as well as future events that have the effect of reducing the company s operating income and available cash balances  such as unexpected operating losses or delays in the integration of the company s seating business  the delivery of the company s mdds interactive video system  customer delivery requirements  new or expected refurbishments  or cash expenditures related to possible future acquisitions 
in thousands  except share and per share data introduction b e is the world s leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft interior products 
b e s products include an extensive line of first  business  tourist class and commuter seats  a broad range of galley products including coffee and beverage makers  ovens  liquid containers  refrigeration equipment and galley structures  as well as a line of individual passenger in flight entertainment products including both distributed audio video and interactive video systems 
b e markets and sells its products to its customers  the airlines  through a direct sales organization  focused by airline and encompassing b e s entire product line 
b e s revenues are generally derived from two primary sources refurbishment or upgrade programs for the airlines existing worldwide fleets  and new aircraft deliveries 
b e believes its large installed base of products  estimated to be approximately billion as of february  valued at replacement prices  gives it a significant advantage over competitors in obtaining orders for refurbishment programs  principally due to the tendency of the airlines to purchase equipment for such programs from the original supplier 
with the exception of spare parts sales  b e s revenues are generated from programs initiated by the airlines which may vary significantly from year to year in terms of size  mix of products and length of delivery 
as a result  b e s revenues and margins may fluctuate from period to period based upon the size and timing of the program and the type of products sold 
historically  b e experienced certain trends in its two revenue drivers as the airlines took deliveries of large numbers of new aircraft  refurbishment programs as a percentage of revenues declined and  similarly  when new aircraft deliveries declined  refurbishment programs tended to increase in number and size 
during the most recent airline industry recession  which ended in  the airlines significantly depleted their cash reserves and incurred record losses 
in an effort to improve their liquidity  the airlines conserved cash by reducing or deferring cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and purchases of new aircraft 
as a result  in contrast with historical experience  b e experienced declines in the number of both new orders and refurbishments 
since early  the airlines have experienced a significant turnaround in operating results  with the domestic airline industry achieving record operating earnings during calendar and consequently  during fiscal  b e has experienced significant growth in its backlog 
the growth in backlog  coupled with the burns acquisition  has led to a significant expansion of the company s revenues and operating earnings during fiscal this growth is a reflection of the airlines need to begin refurbishing worn fleets and their ability to do so as a result of the strengthening of the airlines balance sheets 
b e has substantially expanded the size  scope and nature of its business as a result of a number of acquisitions 
during the fiscal year ended february   b e completed the following acquisitions a on april   the company acquired  through a dutch holding company  all of the capital stock of inventum  a supplier of galley inserts including ovens  beverage makers and water boilers to airlines located primarily in europe and the pacific rim  b on august   the company acquired all of the capital stock of nordskog  an industry pioneer in galley structures and inserts  c on august   the company acquired all of the capital stock of acurex  the leading worldwide supplier of commercial aircraft refrigeration products  and d on october   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of airvision  a manufacturer of in flight entertainment equipment 
on january   the company acquired all of the stock of burns  an industry leader in commercial aircraft seating 
while the company will continue to be susceptible to industry wide conditions  management believes that the company s significantly more diversified product line and revenue base achieved through acquisitions has reduced its exposure to demand fluctuations in any one product area 
the burns acquisition has had a significant impact on b e s results of operations 
burns was one of the three leading north american suppliers of commercial aircraft passenger seats  with a base of airline customers that was largely complementary to that of b e 
by consolidating engineering  marketing  administration and manufacturing operations of the two companies  b e has been able to reduce fixed costs  thereby enhancing its low cost position 
these efforts have allowed b e to increase its engineering capabilities  expand seat production capacity to over  seats per year and provide a substantially higher level of product support 
b e s business strategy is to maintain its market leadership position through various initiatives  including new product development 
in fiscal  research  development and engineering expenses totaled  or of net sales  primarily consisting of costs related to the development of the mdds  with the balance attributable to its seating products and galley businesses 
during the year ended february   primarily as a result of the substantial completion of the engineering associated with the development of the mdds  such expenses were  or of net sales 
the company expects that its research  development and engineering expenses will increase in fiscal as a result of the introduction of the mdds as a line fit option on the boeing b and b aircraft 
results of operations year ended february  compared to year ended february  sales for the year ended february  were  or higher than sales of  for the comparable period in the prior year 
the increase in sales is attributable to substantially higher unit volume shipments of all the company s products as a result of improving industry conditions 
of the  increase in sales for the year   was due to increased seating and services revenues directly related to the acquisition of burns 
excluding the effect of the burns acquisition  sales increased year over year 
at february   the company s backlog was approximately  up from  at february  new order bookings in the year ended february  of  were  greater than new order bookings of  for the comparable period in the prior year 
management estimates that approximately of its backlog is deliverable during fiscal gross profit was  or of sales  for the year ended february  and was  higher than gross profit for the comparable period in the prior year of  which represented of sales 
the increase in gross profit is primarily the result of the higher sales volumes and the mix of products and services sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  for the year ended february  this was  higher than selling  general and administrative expenses for the comparable period in the prior year of  or of sales  principally due to the substantial increases in revenues and the acquisition of burns 
research  development and engineering expenses were  or of sales  for the year ended february  for the comparable period in the prior year  research and development expense was  or of sales 
the decrease in expenses during the current year is the result of a decrease in the level of activity associated with the mdds interactive entertainment system  offset somewhat by an increase in product development activity in the seating products group 
amortization expense for the year february  of  was  more than the amount recorded in fiscal as a result of the burns acquisition 
net interest expense was  for the year ended february   or  higher than the net interest expense of  recorded for the comparable period in the prior year  and is due to the increase in the company s long term debt outstanding throughout most of fiscal as a result of the senior subordinated notes issued at the time of the burns acquisition 
earnings before income taxes of  for the year ended february  were  more than the loss before income taxes of  in the prior year 
income taxes for the year ended february  were  or of earnings before income taxes  as compared to no tax provision in fiscal net earnings were  or 
per share  for the year ended february  as compared to a net loss of  or per share for the comparable period in the prior year  which included the cumulative effect of an accounting change of  results of operations year ended february  compared with year ended february  sales for the year ended february  were  or greater than sales of  in the prior year 
this increase in sales is primarily related to the inclusion of results of operations of burns  which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal offsetting this increase in revenues was the negative impact of a ten week strike at boeing  which ended december  at february   the company s backlog stood at approximately  up from  at february  the increase in backlog is attributable to the acquisition of burns  along with solid growth from orders placed by the airlines 
during the year ended february   and for the first time in over two years  the airlines placed orders for the company s seating and galley products in excess of its shipment levels  resulting in an increase in its seating and galley products backlog 
gross profit was  or of sales for the year ended february  and was  less than gross profit for the prior year of  which represented of sales 
the decrease in gross profit during the year ended february  is primarily the result of the mix of products sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  of sales for the year ended february  this was  higher than the comparable period in the prior year of  of sales  principally due to costs associated with the burns acquisition and related organizational changes brought about by this acquisition  higher promotional and selling costs associated with b e s participation in annual industry trade shows  and higher medical benefits and legal costs during fiscal effective as of the beginning of fiscal the company changed its method of accounting for pre contract engineering expenditures associated with customer orders 
these expenditures  which previously were carried in inventory for amortization over future deliveries  are now expensed as incurred 
as a result of this change in accounting method  research  development and engineering for the year ended february  increased by  to   as compared to  in the prior year 
amortization expense for the year ended february  of  was less than the amount recorded in the prior year and is due to the lower level of intangible assets being amortized during fiscal other expenses were  for the year ended february  and relate to costs associated with the integration and consolidation of the company s european seating business 
other expenses for the year ended february  were  and related primarily to a charge associated with b e s earlier generations of passenger entertainment systems 
interest expense  net was  for the year ended february  or  higher than the prior year 
this increase is the result of an increase in the amount of the company s long term debt outstanding  as well as higher interest rates 
no income tax benefit was provided for the year ended february  as compared to a tax benefit of  for the prior year 
the company recorded the cumulative effect of an accounting change of  during the year ended february  such amount represents the total amount of capitalized pre contract engineering costs which were included in inventories as of february  the net loss for fiscal was  or per share as compared to a net loss of  or 
per share in the prior year 
results of operations year ended february  fiscal compared with year ended february  fiscal sales for the year ended february  were  or higher than sales of  in the prior year 
the increase in sales was primarily related to the results of operations of businesses acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal the level of activity in the cabin interior products industry continued to reflect the depressed conditions within the airline industry 
at february   b e s backlog stood at  up from  at february  substantially all of the growth in backlog was attributable to b e s in flight entertainment products  backlog for b e s seating and galley products continued to decline through fiscal as a result of the depressed conditions present in the airline industry 
gross profit was  or of sales  for the year ended february  and was  or  greater than the prior year s gross profit of  which represented of sales 
the increase in gross profit during the fiscal year ended february  was in large part the result of higher revenues associated with the businesses acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  for the year ended february  this was  or  higher than the selling  general and administrative expenses for the comparable period in the prior year of  of sales  principally due to the acquisitions completed during fiscal research and development expenses were  or of sales  for the fiscal year ended february  for the prior year  research and development expenses were  or of sales 
the increase in research and development was attributable to b e s ongoing new product development programs 
amortization expense for the fiscal year ended february  of  was  or  higher than the amount recorded in the prior year  and was due to the acquisitions completed during fiscal other expenses for the fiscal year ended february  consisted of a charge of  related primarily to intangible assets and inventories associated with b e s earlier generations of passenger entertainment systems 
the introduction of b e s mdds  which b e expects to become the industry s standard for in flight passenger and service entertainment  has captured the dominant market share with it receiving contract awards from major airlines totaling more than million since fiscal the mdds also caused major carriers to convert programs for earlier products of b e to the mdds and has resulted in two of b e s principal competitors offering to develop for the airlines systems similar to b e s mdds 
these events caused the in flight entertainment industry to re evaluate its product offerings and  in the process  have impaired the value of certain of its assets 
as a result  during the year ended february   b e wrote down certain of its assets principally related to its earlier systems 
principally due to the other expenses described above  b e recorded a net operating loss of  for the fiscal year ended february   as compared to operating earnings of  in the prior year 
operating earnings for the period before the special charge mentioned above were net interest expense of  for the fiscal year ended february  was  or  higher than the prior year 
this increase was the result of an increase in the amount of b e s long term debt outstanding  as well as higher interest rates 
an income tax benefit of  of the loss before income taxes was recognized principally as the result of the charge described above 
income tax expense for the fiscal year ended february  was  or of earnings before income taxes 
the net loss for fiscal was  or 
per share as compared to net earnings of  or 
per share in the prior year  principally due to the charge 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements consist primarily of working capital needs and scheduled payments of interest on its indebtedness 
as a result of the burns acquisition  the company has significantly increased cash requirements for the payment of interest on its outstanding borrowings 
b e s primary requirements for working capital have been directly related to increased accounts receivable and inventory levels as a result of revenue growth 
b e s working capital was  as of february   compared to  as of february  in january  the company amended its existing credit facilities with the chase manhattan bank by increasing the aggregate principal amount that may be borrowed thereunder to  the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility consists of a  reducing revolver and a  revolving facility 
the amount of the reducing revolver will be reduced automatically by on april  and on each of the seven succeeding quarterly anniversaries of such date 
the reducing revolver is collateralized by all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of acurex  a wholly owned subsidiary  and has a five year maturity 
the revolving facility is collateralized by all of the company s accounts receivable  all of its inventory and substantially all of its other personal property and has a five year maturity 
the bank credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants  negative covenants and conditions of borrowing 
at february   indebtedness under the bank credit facility were letters of credit amounting to approximately  the company has approximately  under its bank credit facility for subsequent borrowings 
the senior notes and senior subordinated notes are due march  and february   respectively 
at february   the company s cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to  at february  cash used in operating activities during the twelve months ended february  was  and cash used in operating activities in fiscal was  the primary source of cash during the year ended february  was net earnings of  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of  and approximately  from the issuance of common stock  offset by a use of cash of  related to increases in receivables and inventories and  related to decreases in other assets and liabilities 
the primary source of cash during the year ended february  was non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of  and the cumulative effect of the accounting change of  which was offset by a use of cash for research  development and engineering of  and for inventory of  the company s capital expenditures were   and  during the year ended february   february  and february   respectively 
the company anticipates ongoing capital expenditures of approximately million per year for the next several years 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the bank credit facility will provide adequate funds for its working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations through the term of the bank credit facility 
the company believes that it will be able to refinance the bank credit facility prior to its termination  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company s ability to fund its operations and make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled payments and to refinance its indebtedness depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which  in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond its control 
industry conditions the company s customers are the world s commercial airlines 
as a result  the company s business is directly dependent upon the conditions in the commercial airline industry 
in the late s and early s the world airline industry suffered a severe downturn which resulted in record losses and several air carriers seeking protection under bankruptcy laws 
as a consequence  during such period  airlines sought to conserve cash by reducing or deferring scheduled cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and delaying purchases of new aircraft 
this led to a significant contraction in the commercial aircraft cabin interior products industry  and a decline in the company s business and profitability 
over the last two years  the airline industry has experienced a dramatic economic turnaround in profitability and balance sheet strength  and a number of the world s airlines have placed significant orders for new aircraft over the past twelve months 
industry sources are now predicting that new aircraft deliveries will increase substantially over the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the recent profitability of the airline industry will continue or that the airlines will maintain or increase expenditures on cabin interior products for refurbishments or new aircraft
