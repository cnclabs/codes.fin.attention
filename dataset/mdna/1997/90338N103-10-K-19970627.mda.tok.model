item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of the year ended march  to the year ended march  the company s initiatives to improve equipment utilization and to reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue had favorable results for the fiscal year ended march  in this period  utilization for the combined truckload operations increased to  in revenue per tractor per week  compared to  during the same period in the operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved percentage points  reflecting a increase in revenue versus a increase in operating expenses 
the smaller increase in operating expenses  compared to revenues  was due to reductions in several fixed and variable expense items 
operating revenue during the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million  compared to million during the same period in this increase resulted partially from the fiscal acquisitions of csi reeves and hall systems  which together contributed million of the million increase 
us xpress linehaul operations contributed million to the increase 
increased us xpress linehaul revenue resulted from increased revenue miles and a slight increase in the rate per revenue mile 
operating expenses represented of operating revenue for the year ended march   compared to during the same period in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was for the year ended march   compared to during the same period in this decrease is a result of salaries and wages for both hall systems and csi crown representing a lower percentage of operating revenue due to the utilization of owner operators at hall systems and the utilization of outside linehaul carriers at csi crown 
all owner operator expenses and purchased linehaul services are reflected as purchased transportation 
fuel and fuel taxes as a percentage of operating revenue was for the year ended march   compared to during the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the average prices per gallon  offset by a increase in average miles per gallon 
vehicle rents as a percentage of operating revenue was for the year ended march   compared to for the same period in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of operating revenue was for the year ended march   compared to during the same period in overall  as a percentage of operating revenue  vehicle rents and depreciation were for the year ended march   compared to during the same period in this decrease was due in part to increased non transportation revenue from csi crown and an increase in owner operator revenue from hall systems  both of which do not require expenditures for revenue equipment 
additionally  utilization for us xpress linehaul operations increased to  in revenue per tractor per week for the year ended march   a increase from the previous fiscal year  which reduced the number of tractors required 
purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue was for the fiscal year  compared to in the same period in this decrease is due to increased non transportation revenue at csi crown which does not require expenditures for purchased transportation 
operating expenses and supplies as a percentage of operating revenue was for the year ended march   compared to during the same period in this decrease results from two factors an increase in non transportation revenue from csi crown and an increase in owner operator revenue from hall systems  which do not require incremental company expenditures for operating expenses and supplies  and reductions in maintenance expenses

as a percentage of operating revenue  income from operations was in the year ended march   compared to during the same period in special considerations certain factors affect us xpress enterprises and the transportation industry 
the trucking industry is affected by economic risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond its control 
these include economic recessions and downturns in customers business cycles  increases in fuel prices  the availability of qualified drivers and fluctuations in interest rates 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes numerous regional  inter regional and national truckload carriers 
many of these carriers have greater financial resources  equipment and freight capacity than the company 
management believes its strategies of controlled growth and focused marketing will continue to provide freight at sufficient volumes and prices to remain profitable 
changes in economic conditions could reduce both the amount of freight available and freight rates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
in april  the industry experienced a rapid increase in fuel prices 
these increased prices remained throughout fiscal the company partially offset the effect of these increases through fuel surcharges to customers or rate increases in lieu of fuel surcharges 
future increases or decreases in fuel prices are uncertain 
to the extent the company is unable to offset fuel price increases through fuel surcharges or rate increases  increased fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
competition for available qualified drivers in the truckload industry is intense  and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future 
the company and many of its competitors experience high rates of turnover and occasionally have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers in sufficient numbers to operate all available equipment 
management believes the company s current pay structure  benefits  policies and procedures related to drivers are effective in attracting and retaining drivers 
however  there can be no assurance that it will not be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future 
the inability to attract and retain qualified drivers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the trucking industry is extremely capital intensive 
the company depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flows from operations to finance the expansion and maintenance of its modern and cost efficient revenue equipment and facilities 
at present  the company is more highly leveraged than some of its competitiors 
if the company were unable in the future to obtain financing at acceptable levels it could be forced to limit the growth or replacement of its equipment and facilities 
if interest rates increased significantly it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity during the year ended march  were funds provided by operations  borrowings under long term debt facilities  lines of credit and proceeds from the sales of used property and equipment 
at march   the company had in place a million credit facility with a group of banks  of which million was available for borrowing 
in fiscal  the company s primary sources of liquidity are expected to be funds provided by operations  borrowings under installment notes payable and borrowings under lines of credit 
cash generated from operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net cash used in investment activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal of the cash used in investment activities in fiscal  million was used to acquire additional property and equipment  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in amounts expended for purchases of new equipment in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflects the company s leasing of more revenue equipment under operating leases rather than purchasing such equipment 
net cash used for financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million provided in fiscal this decrease relates primarily to the company s greater use of leased equipment in fiscal as a result  the net repayments under lines of credit and long term debt during the year ended march  was million  compared to net borrowings of million during fiscal net borrowings under lines of credit were million during the year ended march   compared to net borrowings of million during fiscal during fiscal  the company obtained a new revolving line of credit with capacity up to million 
a portion of the availability under this new line was immediately used to repay certain existing long term indebtedness bearing higher interest rates 
management believes that funds provided by operations  borrowings under installment notes payable and available borrowings under the company s existing line of credit will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
however  inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally shows a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season and its inherent weather variations 
the company s operating expenses also have historically been higher in the winter months  due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs for revenue equipment in colder weather
