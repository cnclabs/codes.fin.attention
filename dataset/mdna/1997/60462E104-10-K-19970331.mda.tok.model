in  the million decline in interest expense largely reflects substantially higher capitalized interest associated with the company s growing investment in its ongoing construction projects

the sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million  which is included in other  including interest income in during and  the company retired some of its more expensive debt prior to its scheduled maturities 
although these retirements were financially advantageous to the company  the call premiums and the write off of the related unamortized debt issuance costs resulted in extraordinary charges 
there were no such charges during regulation and taxes the company is subject to extensive regulation by the nevada gaming authorities and will be subject to regulation  which may or may not be similar to that in nevada  by the appropriate authorities in mississippi and any other jurisdiction in which it may conduct gaming activities in the future 
changes in applicable laws or regulations could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
in  legislation was enacted which established a federal commission to study the gaming industry 
the gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenues  particularly to the state of nevada and its counties and municipalities 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law  or in the administration of such law  affecting the gaming industry 
proposals in recent years that have not been enacted included a federal gaming tax and increases in state or local taxes 
management believes that the company s recorded tax balances are adequate 
however  it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of possible changes in tax law or in the administration of such law 
such changes  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
capital resources  capital spending and liquidity cash provided by operating activities as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows was million in  versus million in and million in although the company s net income grew by in  such growth was partially mitigated by cash payments for income taxes that represented a higher percentage of the company s tax provision 
these additional tax payments are principally due to the exhaustion of the company s alternative minimum tax credit and the normal reversal of temporary book tax differences relating to the depreciation of property and equipment 
the company s capital spending is increasing significantly with the ongoing construction of bellagio and beau rivage 
capital expenditures in totaled million  compared to million in and million in including land  capitalized interest and preopening costs  bellagio is expected to cost approximately billion and beau rivage is expected to cost approximately million 
at year end  the company had incurred approximately million associated with bellagio and million associated with beau rivage 
the company has also acquired approximately million of fine art which will be displayed in bellagio 
approximately million of such artwork was acquired prior to year end capital spending will increase further should the company pro ceed with the development of one or more casino based destin ation resorts in atlantic city 
although the company has entered into agreements with the city of atlantic city and the new jersey department of transportation and south jersey transportation authority  there can be no assurance as to whether or when the company will proceed with a project in atlantic city 
at year end  the company had a total of million of bank credit facility and commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
during  expenditures on new projects and repurchases of the company s common stock exceeded net operating cash flow  necessitating additional borrowings under the bank credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on such borrowings was approxi mately in on october   the company issued million principal amount of senior notes due october  the lowest cost fixed rate debt securities ever issued by the company 
the notes were issued pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on june  that allows the company to issue up to million of debt or equity securities or any combination thereof 
the net proceeds from the offering of million allowed the company to repay all outstanding bank credit facility and commercial paper borrowings prior to year end during  the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock at a total cost of million 
the shares were repurchased pursuant to the company s existing million share repurchase program 
repurchase of the approximately million shares remaining under the program will depend on various factors  including market conditions  available alternative investments and the company s financial position 
during  the company also expended million to acquire approximately acres of vacant land along the atlantic city boardwalk 
the land is adjacent to acres of land owned by the company for many years 
on march   the company s billion revolving bank credit facility was amended to increase the total availability to billion and extend the maturity date from may to march under certain circumstances  the bank credit facility can be further increased to billion 
the amendments also reduced the company s borrowing cost and eliminated or relaxed many of the financial covenants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the amended bank credit facility 
management believes that existing cash balances  operating cash flow and available borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility will provide the company with sufficient resources to meet its existing debt obligations and foreseeable capital expenditure requirements  including those relating to the development of bellagio and beau rivage and potential projects in atlantic city
