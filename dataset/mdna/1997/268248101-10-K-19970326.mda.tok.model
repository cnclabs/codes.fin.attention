royalty revenues are earned in one of the following ways as a percentage of net revenues from product unit sales by licensees that incorporate the company s products  as a fixed per unit royalty  or as a regular periodic fee based on estimated shipments or usage over time

future operating results this report contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors of which the company is aware that may cause the company s actual results to vary materially from those forecasted or projected in any such forward looking statement 
the following are certain  but not necessarily all  of the factors that the management of the company currently believes could cause the company s actual operating results to be materially less than forecasted or projected in any forward looking statement 
the company received of its revenues in from microsoft 
the economic terms of the company s current agreement  which was amended in  with microsoft with respect to the company s proofing tools products expire at the end of the company anticipates that the economic terms of that agreement will not be renewed on terms favorable to the company  and that revenues received from microsoft will decline significantly after the company receives the majority of its revenue from oems that integrate the company s products with their own products and market them to end users as a single unit 
the business of the company s oem customers is intensely competitive  while the computer software industry has continued to consolidate 
as a result  there is both a decreasing number of potentially significant oem customers for the company s products and increasing competitive pressure for the company s existing and potential customers to reduce costs 
at the same time  it is possible that consumers may reduce purchases of the products of oems for reasons unrelated to the quality or price of the company s products 
these factors could result in decreased revenues from oems 
the company now receives a substantial portion of its revenues from direct and indirect sales efforts aimed at major corporations  government agencies  and consumers 
the marketing and distribution of products to end users  either by the company or by value added resellers or distributors  requires higher sales and marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenues than the oem distribution channel  which could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the company intends to expand this activity through greater sales efforts and the introduction of new products for corporate use  which could further increase the level of sales and marketing expenditures relative to revenues 
the company anticipates that a substantial portion of its future revenue growth will come from corporate  government  and consumers sales  which could result in lower operating margins in future periods 
the company s ability to remain competitive in the computer software industry is dependent on the services of a number of key management and technical personnel  principally software engineers  linguists  and database specialists 
personnel costs for technical staff represent a significant portion of the company s operating expenses  and increased competition and related personnel cost increases for such staff could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
the company has historically operated in narrow market segments that have attracted fewer substantial participants than the general market for software applications 
as the company develops products for end users  particularly in the information management tools and electronic publishing solutions markets  the company anticipates that it will experience increased competition  both as to quality and price  from substantial entities with greater resources than those of the company 
it is possible that certain of the major operating system developers  including microsoft  may add features and functionality to such operating systems  including future versions of windows r and windows nt r  that may compete with the company s products or with those of its other oem customers 
the concentration of the market for operating systems makes it difficult or impossible for the company or its other oem customers to compete on a price basis because purchasers of operating systems would be required to purchase products as part of the operating system that compete with those of the company 
in addition  certain oem customers  such as microsoft  may choose to internally develop products that compete with those of the company in order to reduce their costs 
the company has experienced growth that could place a significant strain on its resources 
the company s historical and projected growth has come from a combination of growth from internally developed products and the successful acquisition and integration of businesses and assets 
changes in the market for mergers and acquisitions of software companies and information databases could make it more difficult for the company to achieve projected or forecasted revenue or net income growth in future periods 
the company s ability to manage any future growth and integrate any newly acquired business will require it to continue to improve its operations and its financial and management information systems  and to motivate and effectively manage its employees 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to integrate and manage successfully businesses or assets that it has acquired or may acquire in the future 
if the company s management is unable to manage such growth effectively  the quality of the company s products  its ability to identify  hire  and retain key personnel  and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company s ability to achieve revenue and net income growth with respect to its information products product line is dependent to a large degree on the company s ability to create and acquire  either by license or purchase  the rights to additional authoritative reference works 
changes in the market for the electronic rights to such works could make it difficult or impossible for the company to acquire such rights on favorable economic terms  which could adversely affect revenues and operating income 
the company has increased the marketing of its products directly to end users outside the united states and has experienced a substantial increase in revenue from foreign sources in the majority of this growth is attributable to increased sales of products to corporate and consumer customers in foreign markets 
the marketing of products directly to end users outside the united states increases the risk to the company s revenues associated with fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies 
such fluctuations could also result in increased operating expenses associated with foreign operations
