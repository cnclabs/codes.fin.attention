the increase in sales to  in from  in resulted primarily from an increase in sales to the existing customer base and sales to several new customers partially offset by the loss of two customers 
sales to existing customers in were approximately  and sales to new customers were approximately  cost of sales in increased to  from  in and increased as a percentage of revenue in to compared with in the increase in absolute terms was primarily due to the increase in revenues 
the increase as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the low margins on one large initial contract with a new customer 
revenues from this customer in were approximately  the company completed this contract at the end of and negotiated higher sales prices on a new contract with this customer in early the impact on cost of sales resulting from this contract was partially offset by a decline in material costs resulting from a market driven decline in prices of memory chips which are a component in many products assembled by the company 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is impacted by margins on individual contracts and the total amount of revenues relative to fixed cost 
the company considers its margins on individual contracts to be acceptable 
therefore  a reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue will result from an increase in sales in addition to improvements in other elements of cost of sales 
gross profit from contract manufacturing was  in compared with  in the decline in profit was due to the same elements that caused an increase in cost of goods sold between the two periods

all operations are now conducted by its subsidiaries with eai providing strategic  financial and other support to these subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to in as compared to for the same period in purchased research and development primarily represents approximately  of the funding provided to baron under the baron loan agreement which management has determined to be in process research and development with no alternative future use and  accordingly  which  was charged to expense 
interest income of  in increased from  in this increase was a result of the investment of funds received from the sale of convertible notes in december in the amount of  interest expense in was  compared to  in the increase is primarily attributable to a charge to interest expense in the amount of  reflecting the amortization of the fixed discount feature of convertible notes and debentures issued in december and may and june  and to a lesser extent the stated interest on convertible notes and debentures  a  charge representing the increase in the principal amount of the original convertible notes and interest on capitalized leases related to equipment acquired in and the loss on investment is a result of the write down of the company s investment in aydin corporation by  due to a decline in the market price of aydin common stock considered to be other than temporary other expenses in were  compared to  in the increase is primarily attributable to a write down of the company s investment in the joint venture by  resulting from the company s decision to sell or otherwise dispose of such investment see item developments joint venture with iai  a decline in the market value of eai common stock securing a note receivable by  a write off of fixed assets of  and an increase of approximately  in the company s share of cost in the joint venture 
results of operations compared to during  the company s sales increased  cost of sales increased both in total value and as a percentage of sales  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased in total but decreased as a percentage of sales 
the company had a loss from operations of  for  which included charges of  and  representing the charge to expense of purchased in process research and development resulting from its investments in baron and the joint venture with iai  respectively

accordingly  the estimated value associated with such purchased research and development of  and  respectively  was charged to expense 
no portion of the purchase price of the company s indirect interest in iti has been capitalized because all of the technologies are in the initial stage of development and considered to be in process research and development 
therefore  the company has recorded a charge to expense of  with respect to formation of iti 
the increase in sales to  in from  in  resulted primarily from the additional sales generated by tanon  which had sales of  in sales from the company s prior existing operations decreased to  from  in which decrease was a direct result of the closing of the company s tucson  az and nogales  mexico plants 
the majority of the services provided to customers at the tucson facility was transferred to the company s manufacturing facility in new jersey  a moderate level of manufacturing services was transferred to the company s fremont facility at the customer s request  and the assembly related services provided at the nogales  mexico facility were sold  together with the assets of that facility 
the sales of  for tanon in decreased moderately from sales of  in  which reflects the loss of revenue from two customers who terminated their relationship with tanon during this period  offset by the growth in sales to tanon s existing customer base 
cost of sales in increased to  from  in primarily due to the additional sales generated by tanon 
cost of sales increased  as a percentage of revenue  to in compared with in  resulting primarily from i the increase in materials cost for a customer with whom the company has expanded its material handling services  ii a price reduction in sales of material by tanon to one of its existing customers  which was negotiated in response to competitive pricing pressures  and iii a shift in the new jersey facility s focus from low volume  high margin customers to high volume  low margin customers which resulted in a lower gross profit margin and a higher volume break even point for the facility 
in addition  the company incurred a loss on services rendered to a major customer 
in january  the company renegotiated the pricing on future services for this customer 
also during the fourth quarter of  the company initiated action to reduce its material cost as a percentage of revenues 
this action includes hiring new personnel to increase the company s material purchasing skill level and upgrading the company s material control computer system 
consistent with the company s shift in focus to high volume during the company began the process of adding to and upgrading its high speed smt capabilities 
two new high speed smt lines were acquired in to increase the existing new jersey facility capabilities  a new high speed smt line was acquired in early to increase the fremont facility capabilities and two additional high speed smt lines are planned to replace two older lines in cost of sales at the company s prior existing operation increased to of sales in from of sales in as a result of the above 
as noted above  the pricing for services to a major customer was renegotiated in january 
this renegotiation  combined with increased sales volume in the first two months of  has returned the company s prior existing operations to a positive gross profit margin  which management expects will continue although there can be no assurance that such operations will continue to have a positive gross profit margin 
tanon s cost of sales increased moderately from of sales to of sales between and  also as a result of the above 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  from  in the increase in the level of selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the addition of the tanon operations 
selling  general and administrative expense for the company s prior existing operations increased to  in from  in as a result of fees paid and warrants to purchase the company s stock granted to consultants  the payment of consulting fees for several directors  the elimination of salary reductions for employees of the company which had been in effect during and additional general and administrative expense incurred in connection with the company s investment in iti  partially offset by reductions in sales  general and administrative staffs during the first and second quarters 
the company has  however  hired additional sales  general and administrative staff in the fourth quarter to support the increased level of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue to in from in primarily because the increase in sales exceeded the rate of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense for tanon was at approximately the same level of  in as in as a result of the tanon acquisition  during the first quarter of the company began taking steps to close and sell its southwest operations in tucson  arizona and nogales  mexico to eliminate the operating expenses associated with these facilities 
the closing of the tucson  arizona operations and sale of the nogales  mexico operations were completed in the second quarter of the majority of the operations which were supporting the company s sales base out of the tucson location were transferred to the new jersey facility in the second quarter of additionally  the company reduced indirect manufacturing and sales  general and administrative staff in its new jersey facility during the first quarter in and in the fremont  california facility in the second quarter of the combined termination expenses for these activities in was provided for as part of the company s restructuring 
management believes that by these actions it has substantially eliminated duplicate expenses and improved operating efficiencies for materials procurement and management 
however  no assurance can be given that such effects will be experienced by the company as a result thereof 
interest income of  in increased from  in primarily reflecting investment income from the sale of common stock in april  july and august of interest expense increased from  in to  in primarily as a result of the interest expense on tanon s credit facilities and  to a lesser extent  the sale of convertible subordinated debentures in september and october
