aet was organized in to acquire a business which develops  manufactures and sells oriented apertured films  or nets  as well as non net thermoplastic products for a number of markets 
in april of  the company acquired the opp films business from hercules incorporated the acquisition 
certain of the end use markets for the company s opp films are seasonal 
for example  demand in the snack food  soft drink and candy markets is generally higher in the spring and summer 
as a result  sales and net income are generally higher in the spring and summer 
for the purposes of this discussion and analysis  the fiscal years ended september   and  are referred to as  and  respectively 
all amounts indicated are in thousands 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of the company s sales represented by certain income and expense items in its income statements years ended september  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating profit interest expense  net net income fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales for fiscal of  were  or percent  higher than sales in reflecting a percent increase in unit volume sales of opp films 
this sales revenue growth was facilitated by new capacity brought on stream during the third quarter of fiscal  investments in new product development and an expanded sales and marketing organization 
this increase in volume was offset in part by lower average selling prices  particularly in the fourth quarter  due to competitive pressures precipitated by lower capacity utilization in the opp films industry 
this lower capacity utilization is the result of the new capacity additions by aet and four of its competitors which are either currently on line or scheduled to start up in fiscal the lower average selling prices for the company during also resulted from a less than favorable sales mix  impacted by a higher percentage of secondary material production due in part to the manufacture of a number of new products 
approximately percent of fiscal sales were from new or enhanced products introduced by the company within the past three years 
foreign sales comprised percent of total sales and foreign operating profit was percent of total operating profit 
gross profit of  for increased by  or percent  over the period 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin was percent in versus percent in this decrease was due in part to the previously discussed lower average prices throughout the industry during  as well as the impact of certain production inefficiencies related to process equipment downtime and the manufacture of a number of new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for were  higher than research and development expenses in of  exceeded levels by the higher expense levels were attributable to the ongoing initiatives of the company to enhance its product offerings and expand the reach of the sales and marketing organization 
these investments are integral parts of the company s strategy to support the investment in a percent increase in its production capacity over a two year period 
these expenses are expected to increase only nominally to support the second phase of this expansion which will be completed in fiscal the company implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of  which includes headcount reductions in certain manufacturing operations  divestiture of certain non core businesses and certain other organizational changes and therefore recorded a  restructuring charge   after taxes 
these reserves represent estimated costs which will be incurred by the company related to severance  voluntary retirement programs and other employment related costs  as well as costs associated with company wide plant restructuring efforts 
the company sold its dry adhesive web and injection molding businesses  which collectively comprised less than percent of total company revenues at the time of divestiture 
proceeds from the sale were utilized to paydown debt and to reinvest in the company s core opp films and apertured films businesses 
net interest expense increased  over due to higher levels of outstanding debt primarily related to borrowings in connection with the first of the two new capacity expansion projects 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a one time charge of  or after taxes  representing costs incurred in connection with acquisition due diligence and negotiations which were terminated during the quarter 
income taxes of for were lower than  due to lower pre tax earnings 
income tax as a percent of before tax income remained constant for and fiscal year compared to fiscal sales for of  were slightly greater than the level of  while unit volume sales of opp films increased by percent  revenues were flat due to insufficient price realization throughout the industry 
this depressed pricing situation was precipitated by an inventory correction on the part of customers and end users of opp films during the first half of  as they reduced inventory levels and consequently demand in anticipation of lower films prices 
demand surged late in the second quarter  and the industry was once again operating at a very high rate of capacity utilization 
overall demand for the company s products was strong as reflected by continued growth in labeling and flexible packaging applications for consumer products such as beverages  salty snacks and confectionery 
for  foreign operations accounted for approximately percent of total sales and approximately percent of total operating profit 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to percent in versus percent in due almost entirely to the previously discussed competitive pricing situation throughout the industry at a time of rising resin costs 
resin costs increased percent from april to september without improvement in opp films selling prices 
the new capacity brought on stream by the company during the third quarter of fiscal exceeded all internal production plans and resulted in reduced production costs in the fourth quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat as a percentage of sales in versus investments in research and development  however  were increased another percent over the prior year and aggregated percent of sales 
the increased research and development expenditures contributed significantly to the development of twelve new or enhanced products during the sales and marketing organization was expanded to support the company s growth in north america as well as its announced initiatives in europe  latin america and the pacific rim 
the aforementioned increases in operating expenses were partially offset by reductions during in general and administrative expenses of  primarily as a result of reduced incentive related compensation 
net interest expense for fiscal decreased  as compared to fiscal this decrease was due to increased capitalized interest on the two new lines under construction 
capitalized interest during was  as compared to  in fiscal income taxes of  for the year ended september  were less than the comparable period  due to lower pre tax earnings 
income tax as a percent of before tax earnings remained constant for fiscal earnings per share decreased from proportionately more than net income due to the percent increase in shares outstanding resulting from the stock issuance in liquidity and capital resources in conjunction with the acquisition  the company entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders to provide the company with senior bank financing in an amount up to  the credit agreement provided for a  term loan facility  a  revolving credit facility  and a  standby letter of credit in support of the company s currently outstanding industrial revenue bond  each of which has a final maturity in and is secured by all of the assets of the company 
this revolving term loan facility provides for reductions in the maximum borrowing equal to  per quarter for consecutive quarters  and a final reduction of  at september   the company had  available under its revolving credit facility 
as a result of the one time charge in connection with due diligence and negotiations for a terminated acquisition during the third fiscal quarter and the restructuring charges recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter  the company s interest and fixed charge coverage ratios were below those required by the terms of the credit agreement 
the company has received a waiver of the applicable covenants from the lending group 
in addition to the credit agreement  the company issued  in senior notes to finance the acquisition 
the senior notes  which bear interest at percent payable semiannually  do not require periodic principal payments and mature  in full  in operating activities in provided  in cash  which was the result of  of net income before depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenditures  less a  net increase in other working capital items 
the net increase in working capital resulted from a  increase in inventory  a  increase in accounts receivable  and a decrease in prepaid and other charges  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  interest paid during amounted to  additions to property  plant and equipment were  and included expenditures related to the two capacity expansions 
these capital expenditures were funded in part by  of net borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement with the balance funded by available cash and cash flow 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold assets related to its dry adhesive net and injection molding businesses 
net proceeds from these sales of  approximated book value and were utilized to paydown borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company is in the process of increasing its opp films production capacity by approximately million pounds with the installation of two new production lines  one eight meters wide and the other ten meters wide 
the eight meter line was completed in fiscal and the ten meter line is scheduled to be operational in the middle of fiscal the total cost of the second new line is estimated to be approximately  as of september  the company had funded approximately  of this cost and anticipates approximately  of additional expenditures during fiscal in connection with certain of these commitments and other capital expenditures  the company has entered into foreign exchange contracts with nominal amounts of  to hedge purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
gains and losses on these contracts result from market risk associated with changes in the market values of the underlying currencies which would affect the capitalized value of the asset 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the company believes that available cash and equivalents  cash flow from the business  proceeds from the announced divestitures of non core business segments and borrowing availability under the credit agreement will provide adequate funds over at least the next months to accommodate its working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service obligation 
inflation management reviews the prices charged for its products on a regular basis 
when market conditions allow  adjustments are made to reflect changes in demand or product costs due to fluctuations in the cost of materials  labor and inflation 
raw materials make up a significant portion of the company s costs and have historically fluctuated 
there can be no assurance  however  that future market conditions will support a direct correlation between raw material cost fluctuations and finished product films pricing
