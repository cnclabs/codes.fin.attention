notwithstanding the significant negative adjustments which the company booked to its cost of merchandise  the company s gross profit percentage improved from in compared to in fiscal management attributes the improvement in the gross profit percentage to year long efforts to control inventory shrinkage  with a particular focus in revising and implementing loss prevention techniques and procedures 
on a consolidated basis  the company s fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses were of sales 
the negligible increase from to from last year is attributed to expenses incurred in absorbing the steinbach operations

on a consolidated basis  the company s interest expense remained at of sales when comparing fiscal interest expense to the interest expense in fiscal notwithstanding the favorable interest rate reduction experienced during fiscal  as a result of vendor prepayments and deposits that the company made during the first two quarters of fiscal  interest as a percent of sales matched last year s performance

fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal declined to  from the  recorded in fiscal the sales decrease was primarily attributable to the general sluggishness of the retail sales economy in  particularly in women s apparel 
comparable store sales also decreased during fiscal on a restated basis  gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal were  compared to in fiscal gross margin dollars were also lower in fiscal due to lower sales levels 
despite the highly competitive promotional retail sales environment  the company managed to slightly decrease its markdowns as a percent of sales 
gross margins represent income derived from sales of the company s owned inventory  as well as commissions earned on sales by its licensed departments 
licensed departments income represented of total gross margin dollars for both fiscal and fiscal operating expenses declined  or  in fiscal from the fiscal levels 
the sales decrease in fiscal caused operating expenses  as a percent of sales  to increase to in fiscal from in fiscal depreciation charges  rental equipment and property tax costs were the primary expenses that declined during fiscal limited capital expenditures and numerous fixed assets becoming fully depreciated in recent years account for the  or  lower depreciation charges 
the company s mainframe computer became owned property at the expiration of the lease in february  accounting for the majority of the  or decrease in rental equipment costs 
refunds from property tax appeals were the main contributor to a  or  reduction in property taxes during fiscal increased borrowings on the company s short term line of credit during fiscal contributed to a  or  increase in interest expense charges when compared to fiscal the higher borrowings were used to fund the loss incurred by the company in fiscal and to purchase the common stock and option of a major shareholder 
during fiscal  the company also recorded a charge of  related to the integration of the steinbach stores into the crowley s organization 
the charge includes a  loss on the operation of steinbach during january and  of travel  moving  and other personnel related costs incurred in establishing the organization both on the east coast and in detroit to accommodate the steinbach acquisition

financial condition at february   the company s working capital was million with a current ratio of  compared with a restated working capital and current ratio of million and  respectively  at february  the million increase in the company s working capital is generally attributed to crowley s change in its method of valuing inventories from the lifo to the fifo method 
the decline in the current ratio is attributed to higher than expected year end inventory levels and the related short term borrowings associated with those inventory levels 
as has been the case historically  the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company s short term line of credit 
in connection with the steinbach acquisition  the company increased the borrowing capacity on its short term line of credit to million from million 
for a more detailed discussion of the change in terms with the company s line of credit  see note d in notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million compared with cash used restated of million in fiscal and cash provided restated of million in the significant change in cash used in operating activities in fiscal generally was attributable to cash required to fund the expenses and increased inventories associated with acquisition of the steinbach stores 
notwithstanding the fact that the acquisition was effected by an exchange of stock  pursuant to the terms of the interim operating agreement  crowley s was required to fund the inventory purchases which were completed during the course of the agreement 
in addition  the initial merchandise stocking of the steinbach stores utilized a significant outlay of capital by the company 
the change in cash used in investment activities also reflected the impact of the steinbach acquisition 
in addition  capital expenditures amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal capital expenditures included store fixturing and additional computer equipment 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal with the acquisition of the steinbach stores  the company s borrowing needs increased in order to fund the steinbach store s merchandising requirements 
as a result  borrowings outstanding under the company s short term line of credit increased significantly from fiscal to fiscal when negotiated  the million borrowing base was adequate to satisfy the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs of both organizations 
however  inasmuch as the company is planning to open new stores and expand the capacity of two stores in  the company s liquidity needs will change 
the company currently has requested an increase to its borrowing capacity from its current lender from million to million 
the company believes that a million facility will meet all of the current funding needs and satisfy the needs for expansion and renovation of its current stores 
capital expenditures for both organizations  exclusive of the acquisition of new stores  are planned at  for fiscal these capital expenditures include store leasehold improvements  store fixturing  and computer and office equipment
