also during  competition has continued to intensify both among all classes of brokerage firms and within the discount brokerage business as well as from new firms not previously in the discount business announcing plans to become significantly involved 
other firms  traditionally discount execution firms primarily  have announced their intention to broaden their offerings to include advice and investment management 
since  some firms have offered low flat rate execution fees that are difficult for any conventional discount firm to meet
