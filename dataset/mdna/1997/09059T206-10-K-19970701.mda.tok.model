item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview operating losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of march  in fiscal and  the company incurred significantly increased costs associated with the production and sale of the biojector system  including sales and marketing efforts  manufacturing ramp up and inventory build up 
the company has been working on a product cost reduction program which commenced phase in during fiscal and results from the initial phase of which were reflected in fiscal operating performance 
the company s ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend in part upon customer acceptance of the biojector system  sustained product performance  implementing additional product cost reductions and attaining revenues sufficient to support profitable operations 
in august  bioject signed an agreement with health management  inc hmi  granting hmi exclusive rights to purchase bioject s needle free injection management system trademark  the biojector  for use in the home healthcare market 
in return for hmi s commitment to purchase a minimum of  biojector units over the ensuing two years  the company granted volume pricing discounts to hmi 
during the term of the contract  the selling price of biojectors to hmi exceeded their standard cost 
during fiscal and  the company sold approximately  and  biojectors to hmi for total sales revenue including syringes of million and million  respectively 
hmi did not place the great majority of these biojectors with patients pending completion of negotiations with pharmaceutical companies for certain pricing concessions for medication to be administered with the biojectors 
in january hmi requested that bioject suspend shipments to hmi 
in february  the company learned from hmi s press releases that hmi expected to default under its loans  to take significant write offs for accounts receivable and inventories  planned operational consolidations  and would restate certain prior period financial statements 
in fiscal  although not obligated to do so  the company agreed to repurchase certain of the hmi inventories  including up to  biojector units  for cash and forgiveness of accounts receivable totalling  the repurchase of these inventories was at a substantial discount to the original selling price to hmi 
in march  the company entered into an agreement with schering ag  germany  for the development of a self injection device for delivery of betaseron r to multiple sclerosis patients 
during fiscal  the company developed a proof of concept prototype and demonstrated this prototype to schering 
the company and schering finalized product specifications 
the company also commenced development of the preproduction clinical prototype 
during fiscal  the company delivered the preproduction clinical prototypes to schering and worked on finalizing the production prototype design 
during fiscal  the company entered into a supply agreement with schering ag and commenced activities related to full production of the self injector 
schering loaned the company a total of million to purchase molds and tooling for production of the product 
in january  the company received notice that its contract with schering ag would be cancelled 
under provisions of the contract  schering ag had the option of canceling the agreement if the fda required extensive clinical studies beyond an originally planned safety study 
schering ag received a review letter from the fda which would have required schering to conduct additional material clinical studies in order to use non traditional delivery mechanisms with its betaseron r product 
under terms of the contract  schering was required to convert its million note due from bioject into approximately  shares of bioject common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in addition   of accrued interest was converted into approximately  shares of bioject common stock at a conversion price of per share 
approximately  shares of bioject stock are held by schering ag 
in addition  schering is obligated to pay bioject for the cost of product ordered through the date of cancellation of the contract 
in january  the company signed a joint development agreement with hoffmann la roche to develop proprietary drug delivery systems for roche products 
the agreement provides for bioject to develop  manufacture and sell biojector needle free drug delivery systems designed to roche specifications 
in return  bioject has granted roche exclusive worldwide rights to distribute these systems and their components for use with certain roche products 
hoffmann la roche inc is the united states affiliate of the multinational group of companies headed by roche holding of basel  switzerland  one of the world s leading research intensive healthcare companies 
as of fiscal year end  the company had commenced design of a prototype device and had agreed with roche on product specifications 
during fiscal  the company developed and delivered to roche preproduction prototypes for testing and developed the clinical preproduction prototypes which were delivered to roche in april as of march   the company and hoffmann laroche were finalizing their submission to obtain regulatory approval to market the product 
hoffmann laroche was also gathering marketing information in order to sign a supply agreement 
in february  hoffmann la roche paid a one time licensing fee totalling  and the agreement provides that it will pay specified product development fees on an agreed upon schedule of which  was paid in fiscal and  was paid in fiscal throughout fiscal and  the company s manufacturing processes were primarily manual 
these processes did not permit the company to produce its products at costs which would allow it to operate profitably 
during fiscal  the company implemented a plan to increase manufacturing capacity and refine production methods to meet anticipated future demand and to reduce product costs 
for the biojector  cost reduction efforts included converting from a two piece to a one piece housing  converting to continuous process manufacturing and implementing volume purchasing programs from suppliers 
for the biojector syringes  these efforts included increasing supplier mold capacity and automating final assembly and packaging 
during fiscal  the company s manufacturing activities focused on retesting the devices repurchased from hmi to ensure their continuing compliance with new product standards and elective upgrade of certain of these units to current version configuration 
manufacturing also focused on finalizing product engineering and on planning for  designing and bringing up the new self injector device and syringe manufacturing lines in advance of product launch 
the company s revenues to date have not been sufficient to cover operating expenses 
however  the company believes that if its products achieve market acceptance and the volume of sales increases  and its product costs are reduced  its costs of goods as a percentage of sales will decrease and eventually the company will generate net income 
see forward looking statements and business risk factors 
the level of sales required to generate net income will be affected by a number of factors including the pricing of the company s products  its ability to attain efficiencies that can be attained through volume and automated manufacturing  and the impact of inflation on the company s manufacturing and other operating costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement its manufacturing cost reduction program or sell its products at prices or in volumes sufficient to achieve profitability or offset increases in its costs should they occur 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
various factors may affect quarterly and yearly operating results including i length of time to close product sales  ii customer budget cycles  iii implementation of cost reduction measures  iv uncertainties and changes in purchasing due to third party payor policies and proposals relating to national healthcare reform  v timing and amount of payments under technology development agreements and vi timing of new product introductions by the company and its competition 
in the future  the company may incur a non cash charge to compensation expense in connection with the issuance of  shares of common stock to the company s chief executive officer 
under terms of his employment agreement  the company s chairman will receive  shares of common stock when the company first achieves two consecutive quarters of positive earnings per share 
upon issuance of such shares the company will record a non cash charge to compensation at the fair market value of the stock on the last day of the quarter in which the shares are earned 
during the next fiscal year  the company will continue to focus its efforts on expanding sales  reducing the cost of its products  developing a ml 
injector for hoffmann la roche  pursuing additional alliances with pharmaceutical companies and conserving its fiscal resources

the fiscal and fees consisted principally of product development revenues recognized for work performed under the schering and hoffmann la roche agreements 
manufacturing expense consists of the costs of product sold and manufacturing overhead expense related to excess manufacturing capacity 
the total of these costs varied from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal due in part to changes in sales and  therefore  to changes in the total costs of product sold 
the increase from to also reflects increased regulatory and quality assurance staff to support the higher level of manufacturing and increased depreciation expense associated with automated assembly equipment installed during fiscal the decrease in expense from fiscal to reflects reductions in materials and labor for injectors and syringes and reductions in fixed and variable manufacturing overhead expense 
fixed manufacturing overhead totalled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development expense increased slightly from to million in fiscal to million in fiscal and then decreased to million in fiscal fiscal expenditures related to work associated with development of the schering device and to initial work on the hoffmann la roche device 
fiscal expenditures related entirely to work performed under the schering and hoffmann la roche agreements 
fiscal expenditures related to final design and transfer to manufacturing of the schering device and additional development work on the hoffmann laroche system

the company has no long term debt 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totalled million at march  and million at march   which represented a decrease of million from to the decrease resulted from operating losses and capital expenditures offset in part by net proceeds from a private placement of common stock and warrants in december and of long term debt borrowing from schering including accrued interest which was converted into  shares of common stock in february in june  the company completed private placement of its common stock and warrants totalling  inventories increased from million at march  to million at march  due to the build up of inventories to support anticipated future product sales and the repurchase of inventories from hmi 
the company has fixed commitments for facilities rent and equipment leases which total approximately  for fiscal the company expended approximately million for capital equipment in fiscal substantially all of these expenditures related to ramp up of manufacturing for the schering product launch 
these assets continue to be carried at their cost on the company s balance sheet because the product is suitable for other home injection applications which the company is pursuing 
the company expects to expend approximately  on non manufacturing capital equipment additions in fiscal the company believes that its current cash position and cash received from a private placement of common stock and warrants in june  combined with revenues and other cash receipts will not be adequate to fund the company s operations through the end of fiscal the company has identified a number of potential financing sources and is pursuing them aggressively 
see forward looking statements 
even if the company is successful in raising additional financing unforeseen costs and expenses or lower than anticipated cash receipts from product sales or research and development activities could accelerate or increase the financing requirements 
the company has been successful in raising additional financing in the past and believes that sufficient funds will be available to fund future operations 
see forward looking statements 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms which are not significantly dilutive to existing shareholders 
failure to obtain needed additional capital on terms acceptable to the company  or at all  would significantly restrict the company s operations and ability to continue product development and growth and materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company has no banking line of credit or other established source of borrowing 
the company s independent accountants have qualified their opinion with respect to their audit of the company s consolidated financial statements as the result of doubts concerning the company s ability to continue as a going concern in the absence of additional financing
