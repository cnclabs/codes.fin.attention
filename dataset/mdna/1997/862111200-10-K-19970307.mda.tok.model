item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements in the following discussions regarding the company s future product and business plans  financial results  performance and events are forward looking statements and are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks detailed below in risk factors that may affect future results 
general the company reported net income for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion  compared to a net loss for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion and net income for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion 
the company s results include an extraordinary gain on sale of lease assets of million in  and restructuring and other charges of million in  and million in revenue increased in compared to the company received increased sales revenue from the timberline timberline r track cartridge subsystem in redwood sd redwood tm  a high capacity cartridge subsystem  powderhorn powderhorn r  an automated cartridge system acs library  and timberwolf timberwolf  an open systems acs library  also contributed to increased revenue during the year 
as anticipated  revenue from older generation nearline r products decreased during as compared to revenue from mainframe online products increased during as compared to  as a result of increased sales volumes under the oem agreement with international business machines corporation ibm in the second half of  coupled with end user sales of the company s virtual storage facility iceberg r in the first half of revenue contribution from network products decreased during primarily due to the continued decline in revenue from a number of older network products and the sale of a non strategic network business during the third quarter of revenue contribution from other products declined in as compared to  due primarily to the sale of substantially all of the company s midrange lease assets and midrange service business in the second and third quarter of  respectively 
revenue increased in compared to  primarily due to incremental sales revenue from timberline and increased sales revenue from iceberg 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales revenue from other products as well as anticipated declines in revenue from older generation nearline products 
the decline in other product revenue was primarily due to the sale of substantially all of the company s midrange lease assets and midrange service business in the company s future revenue and operating results are significantly dependent upon sustained demand for timberline and powderhorn  successfully identifying and capitalizing on product and service markets outside the company s traditional marketplace  including solutions targeted for the open systems market  achieving the milestones and reducing the costs associated with the company s manufacture of mainframe online products under the oem page page agreement with ibm  and expanding its distribution channels 
for discussion of these and other risk factors  see risk factors that may affect future results  below 
the company s cash balances increased million during net cash flows generated from operations of million includes cash generated from the sale of substantially all of the company s lease assets 
these operating cash flows were partially offset by the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock for million  net repayments of debt of million  and investments in property  plant and equipment of million 
the company s cash balances increased million during as cash generated from operations of million was partially offset by net repayments of debt of million  and investments in property  plant  and equipment of million

redwood  powderhorn  and timberwolf also contributed to increased revenue during as anticipated  revenue from earlier generation nearline products  such as track tape cartridge subsystem track  and silverton track tape cartridge subsystem silverton  declined during as page page compared to revenue from the first generation acs library also declined slightly in revenue from nearline products increased in compared to  primarily due to incremental sales of timberline  which became available in the fourth quarter of revenue from powderhorn also increased in compared to as anticipated  revenue from the track and silverton declined in revenue from the acs library also declined slightly in future results of the nearline product line are significantly dependent upon the continued demand for timberline and powderhorn  gaining market acceptance for other new nearline products  including products targeted for the open systems market  expanding the company s distribution channels  and effectively managing pricing pressures 
during the third quarter of  the company announced an oem agreement with ncr corporation for its open systems timberwolf products 
sales of timberline  powderhorn and other new nearline products are expected to offset anticipated further declines in revenue from earlier generation nearline products 
there can be no assurance that timberline and powderhorn will continue to sustain their historical market growth or that other new nearline products and enhancements will be developed in a timely manner or gain market acceptance in the future 
online products revenue from online products increased in as compared to this online revenue increase is primarily due to increased sales volume of mainframe online storage products under the oem agreement with ibm in the second half of  coupled with end user sales of iceberg in the first half of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue contribution from earlier generation online products 
revenue from online products increased in compared to  primarily due to incremental sales of iceberg  which became available during the second quarter of while iceberg sales revenue increased during  the rate of revenue growth fell short of the company s expectations  primarily due to rapid price erosion in the online marketplace  and slower than expected customer acceptance of iceberg 
on june   storagetek entered into a worldwide non exclusive oem agreement with ibm under which the company develops and manufactures mainframe online storage products for ibm 
ibm serves as storagetek s primary distribution channel for this technology and storagetek does not anticipate that it will continue to sell this technology directly to end user customers during the term of the agreement 
the agreement  which expires in  contains certain minimum purchase commitments on behalf of ibm 
the agreement also contains product quality  availability  supply  delivery  and development milestones 
the company s failure to achieve these milestones may result in reduced purchase commitments  the imposition of penalties and  under certain circumstances  ibm may terminate the agreement 
the company anticipates the oem agreement with ibm will benefit the company in through increased sales revenue contribution from the mainframe online product line  due to increased market penetration 
additionally  the oem arrangement is expected to allow the company to redirect resources to other products and services outside the company s traditional marketplace  including products targeted for the open systems market 
there can be page page no assurance that the company will achieve the milestones provided for in the oem agreement  that the company will realize the anticipated benefits associated with the agreement  or that the company will succeed in its efforts outside its traditional marketplace 
network products revenue from network products decreased in as compared to this decrease is due primarily to the continued decline in revenue from a number of older network products and the sale of a non strategic network business in the third quarter of as the company continued the implementation of restructuring actions aimed at increasing the focus on core network products for the information storage systems marketplace 
the company s restructuring activities resulted in the realization of cost savings associated with the manufacture of network products during revenue from network products decreased in compared to this decrease reflects declines in older network products  coupled with slower than expected market acceptance of internetworking products which support communication between networks 
revenue and operating results associated with network products during were adversely affected by difficulties encountered with the integration of network systems corporation network systems  which was acquired in march future revenue and operating results from the company s network products are significantly dependent upon increasing the market penetration for network connectivity and security products  successfully expanding the network product line  and establishing new distribution channels 
there can be no assurance that new network products will be successfully and timely developed or gain market acceptance  or that the network product line will generate any significant profits in the future 
other products revenue from other products decreased in compared to  representing less than of total revenue 
revenue from other products decreased in compared to these declines are primarily the result of the sale of the midrange lease assets during the second quarter of and the sale of substantially all of the midrange service business during the third quarter of no material gain or loss resulted from the sale of the midrange lease assets as the gain on the lease asset sale was largely offset by transaction and integration costs 
a one time gain of approximately million was recognized in in connection with the sale of the midrange service business 
gross profit gross profit on sales increased to in  compared to in  principally as a result of cost savings achieved in connection with the company s restructuring  increased manufacturing volumes  and lower purchase costs associated with components for online and nearline products 
product sales margins in also benefited from reduced sales revenue contribution from lower margin midrange products as a result of the sale of this business 
gross profit on product sales of in was unchanged  compared to gross profit improvements were obtained in from product cost improvements  principally from iceberg  page page and cost savings associated with the increased manufacturing volumes during for online and nearline products 
product sales margins also benefited from reduced sales revenue contribution from lower margin midrange products as a result of the sale of this business 
the improvements in were offset by the continuation of price declines in the online marketplace  and a significant decrease in margin contribution from higher margin network products 
gross profit on maintenance revenue increased to in  compared to in this increase is primarily due to cost savings associated with the restructuring and reduced maintenance revenue contribution from lower margin midrange services as a result of the sale of the midrange service business in gross profit on maintenance revenue was unchanged at in  as compared to the company s ability to sustain or improve product sales margins during is significantly dependent upon the company s continued success in reducing manufacturing costs in all of its product lines 
the company anticipates that sales margins for its mainframe online products will be pressured due to lower oem pricing and scheduled price reductions over the term of the oem agreement with ibm 
while pricing pressures are expected to be partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from increased volumes and operating expense savings  the company must further reduce costs and expenses associated with manufacturing these products in order to achieve expected benefits 
product sales margins also may be adversely affected by inventory writedowns resulting from rapid technological changes and delays in gaining market acceptance for new products 
maintenance margins may be adversely affected in the future by increased price competition 
research and product development research and product development expenditures decreased in as compared to the decrease in expenditures during reflects ibm s agreement to finance the development of enhancements to mainframe online products  effective july   pursuant to the oem agreement 
research and product development expenditures decreased in compared to as a result of the completion of several major product development programs in and the implementation of cost control measures directed at achieving targeted expense ratios 
the company anticipates that its research and development investments in new products outside its traditional markets will increase in future periods 
page page marketing  general  administrative and other marketing  general  administrative and other income and expense mg a and other remained relatively unchanged and decreased as a percent of revenue in compared to  as cost savings associated with the restructuring were partially offset by increased marketing expense resulting from higher sales volumes 
mg a and other increased in compared to due primarily to increased marketing expenses resulting from higher sales volumes 
mg a and other expense for includes a charge of million associated with the restructuring activities and a gain of million realized on the sale of the company s midrange service business 
gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and translation adjustments  net of associated hedging results  are included in mg a and other and aggregated a net loss of million for  compared to net losses of million in and million in see international operations and hedging activities  below  for further discussion of the foreign exchange risks associated with the company s international operations and the related foreign currency hedging activities 
interest income and expense interest income decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a reduction in the company s net investment in sales type lease balances 
interest expense decreased in  as compared to  due primarily to a reduction in nonrecourse borrowings and other long term debt 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset during the first six months of by incremental interest expense associated with the exchange of the company s convertible subordinated debentures for its convertible exchangeable preferred stock in the fourth quarter of as further discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  the convertible subordinated debentures were called for redemption in june  and were either converted into shares of the company s common stock or redeemed for cash on or before july  interest income decreased in  compared to  principally due to a reduction in the company s net investment in sales type lease balance 
interest expense decreased in compared to  primarily due to a reduction of nonrecourse borrowings and other long term debt in the second half of income taxes statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that deferred income tax assets be recognized to the extent realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the currently available information  management has determined that the company will more likely than not realize million of deferred income tax assets as of december  the company s valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   was established based upon the consideration of a variety of factors  including the company s earnings history  the number of years the company s operating loss and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences  near term expectations  and the highly competitive nature of the marketplace in which the company competes 
page page the company s provision for income taxes relates primarily to us state taxes and taxable earnings associated with its international operations in certain foreign countries 
the company s effective tax rate can be subject to significant fluctuations due to dynamics associated with the mix of its us and international taxable earnings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the current status of the internal revenue service examinations 
extraordinary gain as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in march  storagetek sold to leasetec corporation leasetec substantially all of the company s net investment in sales type leases  installment receivables  and equipment held subject to operating leases 
the sale was part of the company s efforts to focus on core businesses and outsource non core activities  including its capital intensive lease financing business 
leasetec assumed approximately million of associated nonrecourse borrowings and the company used a portion of the cash proceeds to retire its remaining nonrecourse borrowings and senior secured notes 
the transactions resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  net of applicable taxes of million  in restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges consist of the following in thousands of dollars year ended december  december  restructuring charges   litigation settlement  merger and consolidation charges  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the million charge associated with the settlement of litigation in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the million charge associated with the merger with network systems in during the fourth quarter of  network systems recorded a restructuring charge of million in connection with an expense reduction plan 
page page the following table summarizes the activity in the company s restructuring reserves in thousands of dollars employee asset lease other severance writedowns abandonments exit costs total balances  december      restructuring charges     cash payments    asset writedowns   balances  december      restructuring charges      cash payments     asset writedowns   balances  december      cash payments     reclassifications   balances  december      restructurings as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the adoption by the company of a formal action plan for restructuring its enterprise and network businesses 
the restructuring was adopted in an effort to establish a more cost efficient business structure in response to competition 
elements of the company s restructuring plan include focusing on core businesses  outsourcing non strategic activities  rearchitecting its distribution processes and accelerating the integration of network systems 
cash payments during are primarily the result of termination payments associated with the reduction in the number of employees by approximately  people 
reclassifications during consist principally of reclassifying a restructuring accrual as other exit costs of approximately million  which was previously recorded as a direct write off of a fixed asset 
the reclassifications had no effect on the company s reported results within the consolidated statement of operations 
while the majority of these remaining accruals are expected to result in future cash outflows  these outflows are not expected to have a material effect on the company s liquidity 
the elimination of recurring costs associated with the restructuring was expected to yield expense reductions on an annual basis of approximately million at the time of the restructuring 
during  the company exceeded these expected expense reductions 
the company anticipates that substantially all restructuring activities will be completed in while the company is evaluating various outsourcing and automation projects in order to gain page page further improvements in operating efficiencies  the company does not anticipate that any material incremental costs have been or will be incurred as part of the restructuring which would offset the anticipated expense reductions 
the company believes that its restructuring programs have eliminated certain non essential functions and excess costs 
based on current short and long term forecasts  the company believes that such cost reductions will benefit future operations 
while the company does not currently foresee any significant additional restructuring charges  the continuing success of the company s ongoing restructuring activities is critical to achieving improved operating results in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the anticipated expense reductions will be achieved  or that the company s restructuring activities will otherwise be successful or sufficient to allow the company to generate improved operating results in future periods 
it is possible that changes in the company s business or in its industry may necessitate future restructuring charges  which may be significant 
liquidity and capital resources working capital the company s cash balances increased million from december   to december  the increase in cash balances in primarily resulted from cash generated from operations of million which was offset by net repayments of nonrecourse borrowings and other debt of million  the repurchase of million shares of common stock for a purchase price of approximately million  investments in property plant and equipment of million  and an increase of short term investments of million 
net cash from operating activities during includes cash received from the sale of lease assets and cash payments associated with the restructuring 
in connection with the sale of lease assets  the company used a portion of the cash proceeds to retire its remaining nonrecourse borrowings and its senior secured notes 
the company s cash balances increased million from december   to december  the increase in cash during primarily resulted from cash generated from operations of million  offset by net repayments of debt of million and investments in property  plant and equipment of million 
net cash from operating activities during includes cash generated from the sale of midrange lease assets and the midrange service business  offset by a one time payment associated with the settlement of shareholder litigation 
the net repayment of debt for of million was primarily due to the repayment of borrowings associated with the sale of midrange lease assets 
the current ratio increased to as of december   from as of december   principally due to an increase in cash of million and accounts receivable of million 
accounts receivable increased from million as of december   to million as of december   primarily due to the company s oem agreement with ibm and its exit from the leasing business during as a result of the arrangement with ibm  the company has experienced an increase in concentration of credit risk associated with the company s accounts receivable 
the company monitors this concentration and does not believe any significant credit risk exists as of december  inventories increased from million as of december   to million as of december   due to the page page reclassification of inventory consigned for sale to customers see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
available financing lines the company has a million secured credit agreement the revolver which expires in may the interest rates available under the revolver depend on the type of advance selected 
the current primary advance rate is the agent bank s prime lending rate plus as of december  
under the revolver  the company is required to comply with certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
as of december   the company had issued letters of credit for approximately million and had approximately million of available credit under the revolver 
in december  the company entered into a financing agreement with a bank which provides for the issuance of promissory notes in the principal amount of up to million at any one time 
the agreement  which expires on january   provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a variety of foreign currencies with the foreign currency exchange rate applicable to each note set at the time the company commits to a future borrowing 
the promissory notes  together with accrued interest  are payable in us dollars within to days from the date of issuance and will bear interest at rates equal to the eurodollar rate plus at least as of december  
under the terms of the agreement  the company is required to comply with certain covenants which can  under certain circumstances  include the maintenance of compensating cash balances 
as of december  the company had not committed to any future borrowings under this agreement 
in january  the company entered into a financing agreement with a bank which provides for the sale of certain us and foreign based accounts receivable on a recourse basis 
this agreement  which expires on january   allows for receivable sales of up to million at any one time and the company s obligations under the agreement are secured by a letter of credit for the amount of the receivables sold 
the selling price of the receivables is partially determined based upon foreign currency exchange rates and any gains or losses on the sales are recognized within marketing  general  administrative and other income and expense  net  in the consolidated statement of operations at the time the receivables are sold 
during  the company sold approximately million of receivables in connection with this agreement 
as of december   the outstanding balance associated with receivables sold on a recourse basis  but not collected  was approximately million and the company had committed to future cumulative sales of approximately million 
gains and losses associated with the receivable sales are not expected to have a material effect on the company s reported financial results after taking into consideration other transactions associated with the company s international operations 
based upon the company s past credit and collection experience with respect to the receivables that it expects to sell  the company believes that no material credit risk exists under the recourse provisions of the agreement 
the company believes it has adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months 
over the longer term  the company intends to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development page page projects and may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company may seek to fund these activities or possible transactions through the issuance of additional equity or debt 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  can be completed on terms acceptable to the company 
total debt to total capitalization the company s total debt to total capitalization ratio decreased from as of december   to as of december  this decrease resulted from the conversion of convertible subordinated debentures in the principal amount of million into million shares of common stock  the increase in stockholders equity resulting from net income earned by the company during of  and the repayment of its nonrecourse borrowings and senior secured notes 
this decrease was partially offset by a reduction in stockholders equity resulting from the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock 
in december  the company called for redemption on january   all outstanding convertible subordinated debentures convertible debentures 
with the conversion of the convertible debentures into million shares of common stock on or before january   the company is effectively free of debt 
international operations and hedging activities during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its international operations  and the company expects that it will generate a significant portion of its revenue from international operations in the future 
the majority of the company s international operations involve transactions denominated in the local currencies of countries within western europe  principally germany  france and the united kingdom  japan  canada and australia 
an increase in the exchange value of the us dollar reduces the value of revenue and profits generated by the company s international operations 
as a result  the company s operations and financial results can be materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company employs a hedging program which takes into account operating and financing activities to reduce exposures and utilizes foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts to further reduce exposures 
the company utilizes foreign currency options  generally with maturities of less than one year  to hedge a portion of its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated revenue from its international operations 
gains and losses on the options are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the associated revenue 
the company also utilizes forward exchange contracts  generally with maturities of less than two months  to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with net monetary assets held in foreign currencies 
the forward contracts are marked to market each month with any gains or losses recognized within mg a and other as an adjustment to the foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation of net monetary assets 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from localized economic and market conditions 
for example  in the past  the company s business has been adversely affected by recessions in europe 
in addition  the company is subject to page page the risks of conducting business outside the united states  including changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  tariffs  quotas  difficulty in obtaining export licenses  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors outside the company s control 
there can be no assurances that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial results in the future 
risk factors that may affect future results new products and technological change the company s results of operations and competitive strength depend upon the successful and rapid development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological advances and changes in customer demand  which necessitate frequent product introductions and enhancements 
these factors can result in unpredictable product transitions and shortened product life cycles  and can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company must make significant investments in research and product development and successfully introduce competitive new products and enhancements on a timely basis 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including the rate at which a new product gains acceptance and the company s ability to effectively manage product transitions 
the development of new technology  products  and enhancements is complex and involves uncertainties  which increases the risk of delays in the introduction of new products and enhancements 
from time to time the company has encountered delays that have adversely affected the company s financial results and competitive position in the market 
there can be no assurances that the company will not encounter development or production delays  or that despite intensive testing by the company  flaws in design or production will not occur in the future 
design flaws could result in the company experiencing a rate of failure in its products that delays the shipment or sale of its products  triggers substantial repair or replacement costs  damages the company s reputation and causes material adverse effect upon the company s financial results 
the company has historically generated a significant portion of its revenue and operating profits from the sale and maintenance of products for the mainframe marketplace 
the company is focusing resources on expanding into new marketplaces including investing in research and development of new products for the open systems marketplace  developing network attached storage solutions  establishing a professional services consulting group to capitalize on the company s expertise in information storage management  and expanding the company s distribution channels 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in expanding into new markets 
dependence on ibm many of the company s products are designed to be compatible with certain ibm operating systems  and many of its products function like ibm equipment due to the significance of the ibm computer operating environments 
future revenue from products and maintenance is therefore dependent on the marketplace s continued widespread acceptance of  and ibm s continued support of  these products 
page page in june  the company entered into a worldwide non exclusive oem agreement with ibm under which storagetek develops and manufactures mainframe online storage products for ibm 
ibm serves as storagetek s primary worldwide distribution channel for this technology 
this oem arrangement represents a significant change from the company s past business model 
the company s success in its mainframe online storage business is now significantly dependent upon achieving certain milestones contained in the oem agreement and ibm s continuous support for and success in marketing these products to end user customers 
because of lower oem pricing and scheduled price reductions over the term of the agreement  the company must reduce costs and expenses associated with manufacturing these products in order to achieve the expected benefits under the agreement 
in addition  subject to required lead times and minimum purchase commitment terms  the oem business model arrangement may cause the company to incur additional costs associated with unanticipated increases or decreases in manufacturing volumes 
the agreement includes termination provisions 
the company may elect to terminate the agreement if ibm fails to meets its minimum volume commitments and would be entitled to receive certain amounts from ibm 
ibm may elect to terminate the agreement for convenience  or on the occurrence of certain other conditions  in each case making payment to the company 
ibm may also elect to terminate the agreement on the occurrence of certain instances of change in control of the company or for cause 
on july   the company received civil investigative demands cid from the us department of justice antitrust division concerning the oem agreement with ibm for mainframe online storage subsystems 
the company received two additional cids in october and one additional cid in february the cids requested production of documents and testimony in connection with a review of the agreement for compliance with the sherman act 
while the company believes that the agreement is in compliance with antitrust laws  it is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the company could be required to pay penalties  modify the agreement or terminate the agreement 
competition the market for the company s products is intensely competitive and subject to continuous  rapid technological change  frequent product performance improvements and price reductions 
in the mainframe marketplace  competition comes from companies that have substantially greater resources  including ibm  fujitsu ltd  and hitachi  ltd  as well as several similarly sized companies  including amdahl corp 
and emc corp 
as it moves into the open systems marketplace  the company will face competition both from its traditional rivals and new sources 
in the network connectivity and security product marketplace  the competition includes a number of large companies with significant market presence and resources  including ibm  hewlett packard company  computer network technologies corp 
as well as a number of other companies 
the company expects that the markets for its products will continue to change as customer buying patterns migrate to the open systems and network environments  and as a result of focusing on emerging products and technologies 
the company s ability to compete will depend to a considerable extent on its ability to continuously develop and introduce new products and enhancements to existing products and expand its distribution channels 
the company s competitiveness could also be affected by cooperative alliances between the company s competitors or other relationships between its competitors  who may emerge and rapidly acquire market share 
these alliances and acquisitions may result in companies with increased market presence or proprietary technology in the company s markets  as well as other companies being page page at various times  collaborators  competitors and customers in different markets 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins and declining market share  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
intellectual property the company s intellectual property rights are material assets and key to its business and competitive strength 
storagetek protects its intellectual property rights through a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  confidentiality procedures  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements 
the company s policy is to apply for patents  or other appropriate proprietary or statutory protection  when it develops new or improved technology that is important to its business 
such protection  however  may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to the company s products 
in addition  competitors may attempt to restrict the company s ability to compete by advancing various intellectual property legal theories which could  if enforced by the courts  restrict the company s ability to develop and manufacture interoperable products 
also  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company also relies on certain technology that is licensed from others 
the company is unable to predict whether its license arrangements can be renewed on terms acceptable to the company 
the failure to successfully protect its intellectual property rights or obtain licenses from others as needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
in  the company entered into an oem agreement with ibm under which certain research and development activities will be funded by ibm  any technology that is developed will be owned by ibm  and subject to licensing rights by the company 
the high technology industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights or positions  which in some instances has resulted in significant litigation that is often protracted and expensive 
from time to time  storagetek has commenced actions against other companies to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights 
similarly  from time to time  storagetek has been notified that it may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of others 
licenses or royalty agreements are generally offered in such situations 
litigation by or against the company may result in significant expense and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in any determination unfavorable to the company 
in the event of an adverse result  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or discontinue the use of certain processes if it is unable to enter into royalty arrangements 
there can be no assurances that litigation will not be commenced in the future regarding patents  copyrights  trademarks or trade secrets or that any license  royalty or other rights can be obtained on acceptable terms  or at all 
storagetek is currently engaged in certain proceedings relating to its intellectual property and alleged patent infringements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the company s legal proceedings 
information systems the company is currently in the process of replacing certain transaction systems  including the order management  distribution  and finance systems 
while the company expects that the new integrated system will increase operational efficiencies and support future growth  future operating page page results and financial condition could be adversely affected by functional or performance difficulties with the new system during the transition period 
manufacturing risks  dependence on suppliers the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products and believes that  in most cases  there are a number of alternative  competent vendors for most of those parts and components 
the company manufactures key components for its products and purchases certain important components and products 
some of these components and products are purchased from single suppliers that the company believes are currently the only manufacturers of the particular components that meet the company s qualification requirements and other specifications or for which alternative sources of supply are not readily available 
in particular  a key component of the company s tape drive heads is supplied by sumitomo corporation on a sole source basis 
certain of the company s suppliers have experienced occasional technical  financial or other problems in the past that have delayed deliveries  but without significant effect on the company 
an unanticipated failure of any sole source supplier to meet the company s requirements for an extended period  or an interruption of the company s ability to secure comparable components  could have a material adverse effect on its revenue and results of operations 
in the event a sole source supplier was unable or unwilling to continue to supply components  the company would have to identify and qualify other acceptable suppliers 
this process could take an extended period  and no assurance can be given that any additional source would become available or would be able to satisfy the company s production requirements on a timely basis 
earnings fluctuations the company s reported earnings have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors  including  among others  the effects of i customers historical tendencies to make purchase decisions near the end of the calendar year  ii the timing of the announcement and availability of products and product enhancements by the company and its competitors  iii fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates  iv changes in the mix of products sold  v variations in customer acceptance periods for the company s products  and vi global economic conditions 
volatility of stock price the trading price of the company s common stock has fluctuated and in the future may fluctuate substantially in response to anticipated or reported operating results  industry conditions  new product or product development announcements by the company or its competitors  announced acquisitions and joint ventures by the company or its competitors  broad market trends unrelated to the company s performance  general market and economic conditions  international currency fluctuations and other events or factors 
further  the volatility of the stock markets in recent years has caused wide fluctuations in trading prices of stocks of high technology companies independent of their individual operating results 
in the future  the company s reported operating results may be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  and in such events  there could be an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock
