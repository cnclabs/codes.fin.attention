in june  the company formed codon pharmaceuticals  inc  formerly known as oncorpharm  inc  a consolidated subsidiary  to develop and commercialize therapeutic products using oncor s technologies in the field of genetic repair and drug delivery 
codon was initially capitalized with a million capital contribution from the company and subsequently raised million in a private placement 
the company has advanced approximately to codon which amount was converted into codon common stock at per share 
on april   codon completed a private placement of  of its preferred shares of stock at per share 
the company purchased  shares in this second private placement 
in october  codon issued  shares of its preferred stock to oncor in connection with a series b stock dividend 
the effect of these transactions was to reduce the company s ownership interest in codon to approximately 
accordingly  the results of operations of codon were accounted for on the equity method of accounting retroactive to january   resulting in a non operating expense of million for the company s proportionate share of codon losses in the company will continue to record its proportionate share of the results of operations of codon  expected to be losses throughout  adjusting the carrying value of the investment and advances until such time that the carrying value and advances are eliminated 
codon is currently seeking additional funding to continue operations 
such efforts have not been successful to date and there can be no assurance that funding to continue operations will be available

in january  an additional million of convertible notes were issued 
as further discussed under results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements  these private placements involve substantial non cash  current and future charges for imputed interest 
results of operations consolidated product sales decreased to million in compared to million in  which represented a increase from million in in  the sales decrease was attributable largely to the discontinuation of certain product lines 
after adjusting for the elimination of the sales of discontinued products  sales of continuing products increased from to the net increase in sales in as compared to is attributable to increases in product sales in europe through the company s french subsidiary  appligene  acquired in september contract and grant revenue decreased to million in compared to million in  which increased from million in two grants were received from the national institutes of health  one in the middle of and the other early in the contract and grant revenue decreased in due to the completion of these grants 
gross profit as a percentage of product sales decreased to in from in  which represented an increase from in the decrease in was due to i product mix changes and competitive pressures on margins in europe  ii costs for regulating the initial stages of the manufacture of a controlled diagnostic product and iii diseconomies of scale with respect to manufacturing overhead resulting from reduced production to lower inventory levels 
the increase in over was due to favorable product mix and to increased sales in europe which had supported higher margins 
repositioning expense in is for charges taken related to the company s decision to discontinue the development  manufacture  stocking and marketing of certain selected products and product lines 
such charges included inventory abandonment costs  goodwill adjustments and employee separation expenses 
future such expenses are not anticipated  but may occur 
amortization of intangible assets in  and was due to the amortization of the portion of the purchase price of appligene attributable to the value of intangible assets acquired  primarily for contracts  completed research projects  and the excess of the purchase price over the book value of the assets acquired 
the intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from two to ten years  with a weighted average period of approximately eight years 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  which represented a increase from million in the increase in was due to legal and other expenses associated with certain intellectual property issues more than offsetting the beneficial effects of cost reduction programs and deconsolidation of the operating results of codon in the intellectual property issues have not been settled and related expenses may continue at a significant rate 
codon selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  its first year of significant administrative expenses 
the increase in was attributable to expenses related to i codon  ii the first full year of the inclusion of appligene  iii depreciation on a new facility in france  iv ongoing higher levels of the european sales force  v unfavorable exchange rate differences and vi the expansion of the company s marketing and field sales force in north america  beginning in the second half of research and development expenses decreased to million in compared to million in  which represented a increase from million in the decrease in resulted primarily from i the deconsolidation of the operating results of codon and ii project cessations as a result of the product discontinuation plan 
codon research and development expenses accounted for million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in was  in part  offset by the costs associated with i initial payments  made largely in common stock of the company  at the inception of two research collaboration agreements with the john hopkins  ii the initial payment  made in common stock of the company  at the inception of a research agreement related to a novel diagnostic test and iii substantial increased activity associated with the development of other diagnostic products 
as the company continues to acquire technologies key to the development of major diagnostic products  such expenses are expected to continue or increase 
there was an increase of million in compared to in research and development expenses attributable to the first full year of the inclusion of appligene in the consolidated accounts 
this increase was offset  in part  by a decrease in the expenditures made for license fees and grants to independent researchers in clinical and regulatory expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  which represented a increase from million in the continued increase of clinical and regulatory expenses in and is attributable to the substantial regulatory efforts associated with the current applications for fda approval of certain diagnostic tests including her neu 
as the company continues its efforts to concentrate on the development  manufacture and marketing of controlled diagnostic products  management expects such expenses to continue or increase 
write off of acquired research and development projects in process of million in was attributable to the acquisitions of appligene and bds 
investment income decreased to million in  compared to million in  which represented a decrease from million in the level of investment income is directly related to the level of investment funds which increased in early with the public offering of common stock and again in late with the private placements  in each case partially depleted thereafter by subsequent cash operating losses of the company 
interest and other expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively represents primarily interest expense which has become substantially more significant through i the issuance of convertible debentures in and and ii the issuance and acquisition of fixed rate debt related to the businesses acquired in in  interest and other expenses included a non cash charge of million representing the value of the beneficial conversion feature in the conversion formula associated with certain of the convertible debenture issues made by the company 
such charges will continue at a somewhat higher rate through the first two quarters of the net increase in interest and other expenses in was partially offset by the gain of million on the sale of the company s pharmaceutical imaging business unit 
equity in net loss of affiliates was million in as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the company s proportionate share of net losses attributable to codon  included in this caption in but included in operating results in and  was million 
the remainder of the equity in net loss of affiliates was attributable to the company s interest in the losses of its other unconsolidated affiliate  oncormed 
the decrease in was due to a reduction in the level of the company s interest in oncormed in late as a result of the factors discussed above  net loss increased to million in compared to million in  which represented a decrease of from million in the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations during the last three years 
liquidity and capital resources the consolidated cash and liquid investments balances of the company were million at december   compared to million at december  approximately million of the cash and liquid investments at december  is limited to fund operations of the company s european subsidiary 
liquid investments include restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as set forth on the consolidated balance sheet included elsewhere in this annual report 
the company invests its excess cash exclusively in publicly traded  investment grade  fixed income securities 
the following table sets forth the most significant elements of the cash flows of the company in in millions of dollars net cash used in operating activities decrease in net investment in working capital proceeds from the sale of common stock and issuance of convertible notes payable principal portion of debt repayments purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements proceeds from exercise of options and other net increase in cash and liquid investments the net cash used in operating activities is the result of the losses of the company described in results of operations above in this management s discussion and analysis 
the company s operations in will require the further utilization of significant amounts of cash 
the proceeds of million from the sales of common stock and issuance of convertible notes payable were from private placements of million in august  september and december and from sales of common stock of appligene of million in a public offering of its stock in july the principal portion of debt service related largely to debt incurred in connection with acquisitions made in for which the final million quarterly installment was made in the third quarter of the increase in cash related to reductions in working capital was caused by the reduction of inventory and accounts receivable 
reductions in working capital are not expected to continue at such rates  if at all 
purchases of equipment are for the on going replacement of office and laboratory equipment  the company expects such purchases to continue at this rate 
any substantial leasehold improvements which may be required in manufacturing facilities are expected to be funded by the company s primary landlord in accordance with the company s current lease agreements 
the company leases most of its facilities under operating leases with aggregate annual obligations for of million 
the company has committed to expend million in support of various research agreements in the company includes its proportionate share of the losses of oncormed and codon in its net losses 
losses relating to the activities of oncormed and codon contributed million and million  respectively  to the net loss in codon currently requires additional financing other than from the company 
restricted cash of million includes million which is contractually restricted for an indefinite period and million which became available as unrestricted cash equivalents early in the company has available approximately million in us income tax net operating loss carryforwards which will significantly reduce any income tax liability which otherwise would be due on profits  if any  earned in the future 
the company has available for use in operations in north america  where most of its cash losses occur  i approximately million dollars at december   or becoming available shortly thereafter  ii an additional million raised through issuance of convertible debentures in january  and iii an irrevocable commitment from a lending source in the amount of million expiring march  the company also holds marketable securities in affiliated companies with a present market value of approximately million dollars  though substantial contractual  regulatory and market restrictions exist with respect to the rate at which these investments could be liquidated and significantly fluctuating market prices make the ultimate future selling prices unpredictable 
with respect to north america  the company believes that it has sufficient sources of cash to fund operations through the remainder of but believes that it will need to raise funds or liquidate assets shortly thereafter 
the company plans to raise needed additional financing through private equity placements and collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners and others 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing when needed  if at all  or on terms acceptable to the company 
the company currently has no commitments to receive additional financing 
any additional funding which it may raise in or likely will be dilutive to the interests of the current shareholders 
since december  the principal source of funds for north american operations has been through the issuance of convertible debt securities 
there are terms in certain of the agreements underlying these transactions which would make it more difficult to consummate similar such transactions in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company could access such funding or other funding sources in the future on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
at march  the company has outstanding approximately million of convertible debentures which convert into common stock of the company at prices which relate to the quoted trading prices of the stock in a period immediately preceding the dates of conversion 
if the quoted trading price of the company s stock declines to or below approximately per share and no debentures had theretofore been converted  the company would need to seek approval from its shareholders to issue the full number of shares required pursuant to any request to convert all of the debentures based upon such price 
if the shareholders elected not to provide such approval  the company would be obligated at the holders demands to redeem in cash any remaining unconverted debentures at a premium to the principal balance of such debentures 
it is unlikely that the company s cash resources would be sufficient to both satisfy such redemption demands and continue to fund operating deficits 
with respect to europe  the company believes that its cash position of approximately million is sufficient to fund operations beyond subsequent event in january and february  the holders of certain of the company s convertible notes exercised their rights to convert million of principal amount of the notes of the company 
accordingly  the company issued approximately  registered shares of common stock pursuant to this conversion
