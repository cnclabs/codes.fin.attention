seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
the company s sales and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter due to certain factors and the company expects these fluctuations to continue 
chief among these factors are seasonal buying patterns of the company s customers and the timing of acquisitions 
historically  outlet sales have slowed in the late fall and winter of each year largely due to inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance for the company s outlets is generally lower during the december and march quarters compared to the june and september quarters 
in addition  the timing of acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations of operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company takes advantage of periodic supplier special incentive programs which extend the due date of purchases beyond normal terms with large volume purchases 
the timing of these programs can contribute to wide fluctuations in the company s quarterly cash flow 
although the company continues to investigate strategies to smooth the seasonal pattern of its quarterly results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company s net sales  results of operations and cash flow will not continue to display these seasonal patterns 
inflation and other economic factors inflation impacts finishmaster s costs of materials sold  salaries and other related costs of distribution 
to the extent permitted by competition  finishmaster has offset these higher costs of materials through selective price increases 
the company s business may be negatively affected by cyclical economic downturns in the markets in which it operates 
in addition  markets in the van conversion industry may increase the cyclical nature of the company s operations 
sales in this market accounted for approximately of sales for the periods reported 
there is no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected in the future by cyclical downturns in its markets 
the company s financial performance is also dependent on its ability to acquire businesses and profitably integrate them into their operations 
the company believes that future acquisitions in the southwest and east coast regions  increased market penetration  store consolidations and improved operating efficiencies will bring the performance of recent acquisitions in line with existing outlets 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity and capital resources are significantly affected by its acquisition activity 
acquisitions typically are financed by a combination of internally generated cash flow  seller financing and borrowings under the company s loan facilities 
the net proceeds from the public stock offering were million and have been used for acquisitions as well as to meet working capital and other obligations in the prior periods 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s operating activities provided million of cash in the nine months ended december  used million of cash for the year ended march  and provided million in the year ended march  the accounts receivable decrease of million since march  was primarily the result of intensive collection activity with certain slower paying customers during the period 
the accounts receivable increase of million from march  to march  was primarily the result of acquisitions during that period 
the inventory increase of million since march  was the result of million from acquisition activity  with the remainder being special truckload purchases in advance of supplier price increases 
inventory days on hand were approximately days in the period ended december  compared to days in the period ended march  the decrease in days compared to the prior year is primarily due to the volume and timing of acquisitions and large inventory purchases 
the inventory increase of million from march  to march  was primarily the result of acquisition activity 
accounts payable decreased approximately million since march  primarily due to extended term purchases near the end of march  with payments coming due in the period ended december  accounts payable increased approximately million from march  to march  primarily due to a high volume of inventory purchases  which were offset by payment discounts to major vendors 
the company s investing activities in the period ended december  primarily consisted of an acquisition with a purchase price of million financed in part by million of long term obligations to the seller 
the twelve months ended march  investing activities primarily consisted of the sale of marketable securities of million used to fund acquisition downpayments of million 
the balance of acquisition down payments were funded through the company s credit facilities 
the company believes its cash and other liquid resources  cash flow generated from operating activities  and the million of available line of credit  will be sufficient to support operations and general capital requirements for the next twelve months 
depending on the availability of acquisitions  the company may incur additional debit or issue equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available to the company
