the company undertakes no obligation to republish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the company which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect the company s business in this report and in the company s periodic reports on forms q and k filed with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations the company s results of operations during and late were significantly impacted by changes in the zero emission vehicle zev mandates established by the california air resource board carb in an effort to improve california air quality 
electric vehicles evs are the only vehicles that qualify as zero emission 
the zev mandate originally required that percent of vehicles sold in california by be zev 
the percent rule would have increased to percent in   and an approximate total of  vehicles for all five years 
the mandate stepped up the requirement to percent approximately  vehicles in and was to continue at that rate for successive years 
this mandate was challenged by automakers and was reevaluated by carb in  causing uncertainty in the ev market 
in december  carb announced a cancellation of the mandate for through  in return for an agreement from the automakers to continue development of ev s  maintain production capacity and place a limited amount of vehicles on the road prior to according to carb  each of the big seven automakers gm  ford  chrysler  and four japanese auto manufacturers have signed a memorandum of agreement with carb agreeing to maintain ev production capacity of  evs per year and to sell a limited number of evs in california in  and massachusetts and new york have maintained mandates for zev sales following california s original plan beginning with a percent zev requirement in these mandates have been challenged by automakers  but remain in effect 
the company s primary sources of funds from through were obtained from companies interested in the development and manufacture of a lead acid battery for evs 
during  the company focused substantial resources on purchasing machinery and implementing production processes to significantly increase the capacity of the manufacturing facility and successfully demonstrated the ability to produce the horizon battery in commercial quantities primarily for electric vehicles 
as a result of these efforts  the company received a production purchase order from chrysler corporation chrysler in december for up to million in battery sales cumulatively over the following three years 
shortly after the receipt of the chrysler order  carb announced the zev mandate cancellation until as a result  orders did not materialize as anticipated and the company expects battery orders from chrysler to be substantially reduced from its original order in the near term 
at this time the company is unable to quantity the amount and timing of batteries which may be ordered from chrysler 
in july  the company received a  payment from chrysler as compensation for the continued capacity maintenance and ramp up costs incurred by the company in relation to its role as a supplier to the automaker for its electric powered interurban commuter epic program and for various engineering  research and development efforts er d 
with carb s ruling to delay mandated sales of evs in california  automakers reduced their projected ev production numbers substantially 
in  the company had received substantial purchase orders and established business relationships with several small vehicle conversion companies established to retrofit vehicles for electric propulsion 
these companies have either gone out of business or have refocused efforts in other markets 
to date  the company has sold only limited quantities of the two production horizon models to companies other than chrysler 
as a result of much lower than anticipated mandate related sales of lead acid batteries in  the company refocused efforts to market the horizon battery to oems producing evs and hybrid electric vehicles hev in domestic and international markets that have been driven by consumer demand rather than by government legislation 
the company also expanded efforts into other areas of the growing world wide market for rechargeable batteries including portable power  starting  lighting  and ignition sli  and power management 
the company has developed or is working toward strategic business relationships and cooperative development agreements with companies and government agencies such as black decker portable power tools  lockheed martin hevs  fiat auto evs and hevs  the defense advanced project agency darpa evs and hevs  and horizon aircraft aircraft starting  and others which remain confidential 
in and early  the company designed seven new horizon battery designs  five of which have advanced to the prototype stage 
management now believes it has opportunity for volume sales with some of these companies and other oems expected to begin in late  which is later than initially anticipated 
however  the placement of such orders is dependent on final customer acceptance of prototypes  the ability of the company to build large volumes of various battery types at a competitive price and government certification of certain battery types for particular uses 
horizon technology allows for design flexibility while maintaining expected performance characteristics and the potential for low cost manufacturing techniques  however  extensive engineering design is required to customize each horizon module to meet the unique size  weight  and performance characteristics required for different applications 
additionally  two factors have affected progress with potential applications product performance problems early in  which were corrected in mid  and questions regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
these factors are evaluated carefully by customers before entering an agreement with the company or placing large orders for the company s products 
management believes that revenue from cooperative development agreements  contracts and battery sales will increase in  however  such revenue is not expected to be adequate to fund operations prior to late when large quantity battery orders may materialize 
until then  additional sources of debt and or equity financing will be required to sustain operations 
however  the placement of such orders is dependent on final customer acceptance of prototypes  the ability of the company to build large volumes of various battery types at a competitive price and government certification of certain battery types for particular uses 
management is attempting to raise additional funds  primarily in the form of strategic partner relationships and license agreements with customers and organizations that can aid the penetration of target markets and can assist financially  however there can be no assurance that such funding can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the company recently completed an interim  loan with a large manufacturing company and is discussing other arrangements with that company which could result in additional debt or capital to the company 
however  there is no assurance that any other agreements with the manufacturing company will be made 
revenue the company generated project revenue of approximately   and  for the years ending december   and  respectively 
during  the company generated approximately  in project revenue from chrysler for various environmental and other tests performed on the horizon battery 
the remainder of project revenue generated in was from various customers with whom the company is developing and or refining prototype batteries for various electric vehicle and non electric vehicle applications fiat  black decker  darpa and others which remain confidential 
management believes that revenue from project agreements which decreased from may increase beginning in as the company has repositioned itself into its target markets with major oems and expects to finalize and complete project agreements to design and build prototype batteries  however  the amount and timing of such revenue is uncertain 
approximately  of project revenue in and  in was generated under an agreement with chrysler for the retrofit of the horizon battery for their ns electric minivan program 
the program concluded in project revenue of  generated during was from a program to perform a preliminary design review pdr for a potential manufacturing facility in india 
this review was concluded in and work under this program was terminated 
approximately  of project revenue in was earned under an agreement with the electric power research institute epri for the development and commercialization of the company s proprietary advanced lead acid battery 
this program concluded in the company had battery sales of   and  for the years ending december   and  respectively 
approximately of the company s and battery sales  were generated from chrysler 
in  battery sales to chrysler were primarily to fill orders in accordance with the production purchase order placed in december in  battery sales to chrysler were primarily for testing of the battery in their ns electric minivan program  which resulted in the receipt of the production purchase order from chrysler in december the remainder of battery sales generated in all years were from numerous customers requesting batteries for testing and evaluation 
management expects the level of battery sales to increase beginning in late or as the company receives an increase in orders under the chrysler production purchase order and from others currently testing various types of batteries 
however  the amount and timing of orders from chrysler and others is uncertain and could be impacted materially by the california  new york  and massachusetts mandates 
in july  the company received a  payment from chrysler 
chrysler designated  of this payment as compensation for continued capacity maintenance and ramp up costs incurred by the company in relation to its role as a supplier to the automaker for its electric vehicle epic minivan program and  for various er d efforts 
the company recorded  as income as all tasks necessary to earn the income were performed and there were no further obligations related to such revenue 
the company recorded  as deferred revenue which will be recognized in income as the er d tasks are performed 
the company also generated  and  in and  respectively  in license fees under a distribution agreement with mitsui engineering shipbuilding co  ltd 
mes for the export and exclusive distribution of the company s horizon battery in japan 
in march  the company completed a termination agreement with mes which terminated the distribution agreement and settled all outstanding financial matters with mes  including the conversion of all outstanding convertible notes payable owed to mes approximately  to common stock of the company at per share 
additionally  the company generated revenue of  in the year ended december  from an agreement with bdm technologies  inc bdm for technical support in developing a low rate initial production line for the horizon battery 
the bdm agreement ended in costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased significantly during the year ended december  compared to during  management implemented cost control measures to conserve cash and to reduce expenses  particularly in light of the change in the california mandates 
costs were also reduced as a result of increases in productivity 
generally  total costs were higher in as compared to  as in  the company began to purchase machinery and implement production processes to manufacture the horizon battery in commercial quantities and increased the production  marketing and administrative staffs accordingly in anticipation of the production purchase order received from chrysler in december during  the company also incurred significant nonrecurring costs to replace batteries which failed to perform as expected due to early manufacturing problems as well as improper storage and charging of the batteries by customers 
additionally  the company issued  shares of unregistered  restricted shares of common stock in which were valued at  and charged to expense  associated with investor public relations services to be provided by a consulting firm 
significant research and development expenditures were also incurred in which resulted in technical achievements in specific energy  power and cycle life from batteries produced on the manufacturing line  not just laboratory prototypes 
interest costs were higher in as well due to the incurrance in of approximately  in convertible debt financing which generally converted within days of the respective financing 
interest costs in included  recorded during as a restatement to financial statements related to the conversion discount from market on the convertible notes payable generally 
the discount was amortized over the period beginning with the issuance of the debt to the first date that conversion could occur generally days 
interest costs of  were recorded in for the convertible notes payable issued in there were no convertible notes payable issued in since sales did not materialize as anticipated in late and into  management began a cost reduction program 
staffing was reduced by approximately during and the capacity of the san marcos plant was increased through upgrades and further refinement of the production processes 
during late  management made the decision to consolidate its austin headquarters into the san marcos manufacturing plant to further reduce costs 
manufacturing costs have remained high as a percentage of battery sales during due to the fact that the company has maintained the minimum production level necessary to demonstrate the ability to manufacture the horizon battery in commercial quantities  even though battery sales of current battery models were significantly less than expected 
management expects manufacturing costs to decrease as a percentage of battery sales when volume production begins  however  the timing and amount of battery orders is uncertain 
management is continuing its efforts to control costs and reduce monthly cash expenditures 
even though total costs and expenses decreased in compared to  certain non cash expenses significantly increased during compared to depreciation and amortization costs nearly doubled from because a significant amount of equipment and intangibles were acquired during and were depreciated amortized for the entire period in compared to a shorter period in in addition  during  the company disposed of approximately  of equipment which was no longer in use 
prior to june  total costs were substantially lower  as the company was primarily performing research and development activity related to the horizon battery  and costs for the production facility were borne by a strategic corporate partner 
in the fourth quarter of  the company formalized its arrangement with bdm and agreed to a technology license agreement whereby the company licensed bdm s manufacturing technology for use in producing the horizon battery 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  the company agreed to pay bdm  cash  issue  shares of common stock in equal installments over a three year period  issue  shares of common stock if the company decides to maintain the license beyond the original three year term  and to grant  options to purchase common stock at per share 
the company also agreed to acquire bdm s interest in the corporate joint venture formed by bdm and the company in for  shares of common stock 
the common stock issued to bdm is unregistered  however  bdm has been given certain demand and piggyback registration rights 
the company recorded an expense of  in for the license of this manufacturing technology and will have no further expenses related to this technology in the future 
as a part of the battery manufacturing process  the company handles and disposes of various hazardous materials such as lead and sulfuric acid 
the company is subject to strict environmental regulations and has incurred significant costs in installing state of the art equipment to manage and control hazardous substances and pollution 
the company expended   and  in  and  respectively  in capital expenditures for such equipment 
as part of its on going operations  the company incurred   and  in non capital expenditures in  and  respectively  to properly dispose of hazardous materials and waste 
as a result of such preventive measures  the company has not incurred significant remediation costs and management is not currently aware of any infrequent or non recurring clean up expenditures to be incurred in the future based on present circumstances and conditions 
during the years ended december   and  the company issued approximately   and  shares of common stock  respectively  as a result of financing transactions  purchases of technology and equipment  payment of the technology license payable and consulting services and the exercise of stock options 
as a result of the increase in shares for these years  the loss per share in each was less than it would have been based on the shares outstanding at the end of the preceding year 
management of the company believes that the issuance of shares in these years was necessary to fund the increased working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company did not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund its working capital needs 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately  in down from  in 
as a result  the company sold  shares of common stock which resulted in net proceeds to the company of  during the year down from  of external funding raised in 
included in cash flow from operations in is a  payment from chrysler for compensation for continued capacity maintenance  er d and ramp up costs incurred by the company in relation to its role as a supplier to the automaker for its electric vehicle epic minivan program 
funds generated in were used to maintain minimum production capabilities and a core staff to sustain operations 
capital expenditures of approximately  were made in order to further automate the production process and reduce operating costs 
during  the company significantly reduced operating costs by reducing personnel approximately and consolidating its austin headquarters into the san marcos manufacturing facility 
these cost reductions were achieved while still increasing the company s production capacity 
management expects the level of battery sales to increase beginning in late as the company receives an increase in orders under the chrysler production purchase order and from others currently testing various types of batteries 
however  due to weakened government mandates  management does not expect sales from chrysler to reach levels originally projected in the near term 
in addition  management expects revenue from project agreements to increase from current levels beginning in late or as the company finalizes project agreements to design and build prototype batteries and delivers such products and services 
the timing and amount of battery sales and revenue from project agreements is uncertain 
management does not expect sales from these orders or services to generate sufficient funds to support its overall working capital and capital expenditure needs through additional debt and or equity financing will be necessary to sustain operations 
in january  the company completed a private placement of  shares of common stock with its executive officers and certain other accredited investors which generated net proceeds of  in connection with this offering  the company issued  warrants with exercise prices ranging from to per share 
all warrants have a two year term from date of issue 
the portion of the private placement sold to executive officers  may have to be repaid by the company if the purchase of such shares is not approved by the shareholders 
in january  the company filed a registration statement on form s for the sale of  shares issued to ally capital corporation ally as prepayment for capital lease obligations owed by the company 
the shares will be sold by ally  the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy lease obligations approximately  as of march  
if the proceeds from the sale of such shares are not sufficient to satisfy the lease obligations due to fluctuations in market prices  the company will  on a one time basis  issue additional shares of common stock or pay cash to ally to make up the deficiency 
ally will retain any overage from the sale of such shares in excess of the lease obligations 
upon payment of all lease obligations  letters of credit of  which securitize the lease obligations will be canceled and certificates of deposit of an equal amount that collaterialize the letters of credit will be released 
management does not expect to complete this transaction until the second quarter of see note q in the financial statements for further discussion regarding the accounting for these shares as of december  subsequent to december   the company received  in the form of an unsecured promissory note bearing interest at from an unrelated fortune manufacturing company with whom the company is pursuing additional relationships 
the note is payable on demand at any time after may  the lender may credit the note against any purchase price it agrees to pay for any other securities  however  there is no assurance that any other business arrangements will be completed with the lender 
the company does not anticipate significant capital expenditures in to satisfy anticipated demand for battery orders 
there were no significant capital commitments at december  convertible debentures of  will mature on april  these debentures are convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to of the average closing price of the common stock for the five business days immediately preceding such time as the debentures are converted 
as of march   the company had approximately  of unrestricted cash available 
management is continuing its efforts to control costs and believes it has sufficient cash to continue operations through the first quarter of  however  it will be necessary to raise additional financing before the end of the second quarter of to sustain operations and fund anticipated growth 
management believes that the cash shortage from operations will decrease in if anticipated project agreements are finalized and volume orders for batteries are received  additional external financing for operations may not be necessary in late however  the timing and amount of battery orders and revenue from project agreements are uncertain 
the company has historically been able to raise funds on a repeated basis to sustain operations 
management is currently attempting to raise additional funds  primarily in the form of strategic partner relationships and license agreements with customers and organizations that can aid penetration of target markets and can assist financially  however  there can be no assurance that such funding can be obtained on favorable terms to the company  if at all 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern 
other in  the company signed a know how license agreement the agreement with horizon battery technologies  ltd  hbtl  of bombay  india  calling for the completion of several detailed subordinate agreements with the ultimate purpose to license the manufacture and sale of batteries in india 
the effectiveness of the agreement was conditioned upon the subsequent execution of these six related agreements  none of which were executed 
the company believes  therefore  the agreement never became effective and has no force or effect 
separately in  hbtl agreed to pay the company  for a preliminary design review pdr for a potential manufacturing facility in india which was required to complete one of the subordinate agreements 
the company received  from hbtl and completed the pdr in the remaining  was never paid by hbtl  in spite of repeated demands by the company 
in september  the company received a demand from hbtl to arbitrate damage claims for alleged breach of the agreement 
hbtl claims damages of approximately  for its expenses and lost profits related to the agreement 
the company disputes the claim for damages and will vigorously defend any actions taken by hbtl to pursue the claims 
the company has filed a petition in travis county  texas  seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment that hbtl has no right to arbitration or monetary relief 
hbtl is contesting jurisdiction and is seeking removal of the proceedings to the us federal courts 
the company has not recorded a liability in the financial statements at december  for this uncertainty  as management is unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of this matter or to estimate the amount or range of potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable 
the resolution of this matter could  in the worst case  have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
on june   the company s shareholders approved an amendment to the company s restated certificate of incorporation that effected a one for ten reverse stock split 
the company amended its certificate of incorporation on july  to effect the reverse split 
pursuant to this amendment  each ten shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the reverse split old shares were reclassified as one share of new common stock new shares 
the par value per share of the common stock has correspondingly increased from per share to per share 
no fractional new shares were issued as a result of the reverse split  rather  each shareholder whose old shares were not evenly divisible by ten received one additional new share for the fractional new share that such shareholder would otherwise be entitled to have received as a result of the reverse split 
all references in this report and in the financial statements to share and per share amounts have been restated to retroactively reflect the reverse split 
management of the company believes that inflation does not have a material effect on the company s results of operations
