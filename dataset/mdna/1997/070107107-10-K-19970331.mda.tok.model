  the decreases in average daily production were primarily attributable to the combined effects of sales of producing properties during and and natural production declines 
as more fully described below under liquidity and capital resources  the company consummated two transactions during in which all of its assets in the d j basin were sold 
as of december   these assets represented approximately two thirds of the company s producing wells and of its proved oil and gas reserves

  during  the company also recognized gas revenue for payments received with respect to transferred section tax credits in the amount of  other revenue in was primarily derived from a small processing facility that was decommissioned late in the year 
in  other revenue related mainly to interest income on cash equivalents held after the second d j basin asset sale transaction 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses for were  a decrease of  or  compared to lease operating costs per mcfe produced during averaged 
compared to 
in these higher costs per mcfe were caused primarily by the increased portion of the company s total active wells that are oil wells  with typically higher unit operating costs  following the sale of the d j basin assets 
production taxes 
production taxes for were  a decrease of  or  compared to production taxes as a percent of oil and gas sales for were  compared to in the increased average tax rate was due to a greater portion of sales occurring in higher tax jurisdictions in depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for was  a decrease of  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower production volumes in as compared to the depletion rate of 
per mcfe produced in was slightly lower than the 
per mcfe average depletion rate during property impairment 
during  the company recognized a property impairment charge of million  as the result of the capitalized costs of its oil and gas properties exceeding a ceiling on such costs computed in accordance with prescribed accounting guidelines 
general and administrative  net 
general and administrative expenses for were  a decrease of  or  as compared to the decreases resulted primarily from staff reductions made during the second half of and the first half of and partially due to reductions in office rent expense as a result of relocating and decreasing the size of the corporate headquarters 
interest expense 
interest expense for totaled  representing a decrease of  or  as compared to the decrease was principally attributable to lower average borrowings as a result of asset sales proceeds applied to debt retirement during  as summarized below year ended december  average borrowings in thousands   average interest rate on borrowings income tax benefit provision 
the difference between the income tax provision for and the income tax benefit for  and the amounts that would be calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to income before income taxes is due primarily to the reversal of the  deferred tax asset valuation allowance established during results of operations years ended december  and revenue

  the declines in production are partially attributable to the sale of marginal properties during lower production also resulted from normal depletion related declines that were not fully offset by new drilling and recompletion activities 
the company recognized gas revenues for payments received with respect to transferred section tax credits  in the amounts of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses for were  a decrease of  or  compared to lease operating costs per mcfe produced during averaged 
compared to 
in these higher costs per mcfe were caused primarily by a decline in the number of new wells brought on line  since such wells typically have relatively high initial production rates  generating average unit production costs that are lower than more mature properties 
production taxes 
production taxes for were  an increase of  or  compared to production taxes as a percent of oil and gas sales for were  compared to in the increased average tax rate was due to a greater portion of sales occurring in higher tax jurisdictions in depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for was  a decrease of  or  as compared to the decrease was attributable to the lower production volumes in as compared to  as the average depletion rate of 
per mcfe produced in was higher than the 
per mcfe rate in the increase reflects investment costs per mcfe of reserves added during the second half of and in which were above the company s historical average  as well as a reduction in estimated proved reserves at december  due  in part  to the effects of using lower gas prices in determining economic production limits 
property impairment 
during  the company recognized a property impairment charge of million  as the result of the capitalized costs of its oil and gas properties exceeding a ceiling on such costs computed in accordance with prescribed accounting guidelines 
general and administrative  net 
general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  or  as compared to the increase is primarily due to smaller recoveries from third party working interest owners and nonrecurring charges of  related to staff reductions  settlement of a legal dispute  and an unsuccessful corporate acquisition effort 
the lower recoveries resulted from the company s acquisition in late of additional working interests in certain properties that it operates and reduced billings for drilling and completion overhead due to a less active property development program in decreases in gross general and administrative expenses resulting from late reductions in office staff and other administrative costs had minimal impact in interest expense 
interest expense for totaled  an increase of  or  as compared to this increase was due to the combined effects of increased average borrowings and higher interest rates  as summarized below year ended december  average borrowings in thousands   average interest rate on borrowings income tax benefit provision 
the difference between the income tax benefit for  and the amount that would be calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to the loss before income taxes is due to the establishment of a  deferred tax asset valuation allowance during liquidity and capital resources in february  the company entered into two agreements pursuant to which it sold all of its assets in the d j basin  effective january   for an aggregate adjusted sales price of million 
the sale of approximately one third of these d j basin assets was closed in march and the sale of the remainder was closed in june combined  these transactions resulted in the disposition of two thirds of the company s total wells and approximately of its estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of december  a portion of the sales proceeds was used to repay all outstanding long term debt and the remainder  net of transaction costs  was initially invested in short term  interest bearing cash equivalents pending redeployment into new oil and gas investments 
the company s remaining producing properties after the sale were primarily mature oil and gas fields in the powder river basin  green river basin  and elsewhere in the rocky mountain region 
in august  following the sale of the d j basin assets  the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with its existing bank group that improved certain terms  including fees and interest rates  applicable under the line of credit 
the amended credit agreement provides for the interest rate on borrowings to be determined by reference to either the prime rate or libor  at the company s election 
a varying spread of to is added to the prime rate  or to is applied to libor  based upon the company s debt to capitalization ratio at the time 
the credit agreement provides for borrowings to be revolving loans until august   at which time the outstanding balance will be converted into a four year amortizing term loan 
the credit agreement contains various covenants  including ones that could limit the company s ability to incur other debt  dispose of assets  pay dividends  or repurchase stock 
the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was established at million in august and is scheduled to be redetermined as of april  and generally thereafter at six month intervals until converted into a term loan 
the company is anticipating that at the next redetermination date the borrowing base will be established at a level at or above the present level of million  but there can be no assurance that this will occur 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility 
in addition to availability under the credit line  the company s capital resources at december  included approximately million of net working capital  inclusive of million of cash and cash equivalents 
prior to sale of its d j basin assets the company had a working capital deficit and little unutilized capacity under its revolving credit facility 
the d j basin asset sales significantly improved the company s liquidity but also significantly reduced its oil and gas production and  consequently  its operating cash flow 
prior to the company s investments in oil and gas properties typically exceeded its cash flow from operating activities  with the excess funded primarily with bank borrowings and proceeds from equity offerings 
the company s total capital expenditures on oil and gas properties totaled million in  million in  and million in by comparison  cash flows from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled million in  million in  and million in the large decline in capital expenditures from to was due  in part  to liquidity constraints that developed when declining rocky mountain gas prices unfavorably impacted cash flow and borrowing capacity and reduced the number of economically viable development projects within the company s asset base 
the company s capital expenditures are generally discretionary and activity levels are determined by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices  interest rates  availability of funds  quantity and character of identified investment projects  availability of service providers  and competition 
the company intends to use the improved liquidity resulting from the d j basin asset sales to make new investments in oil and gas properties  through acquisition and development of proved properties  exploration  and exploitation of its property base 
the company had no extraordinary capital expenditure commitments pending at december  however  in february the company acquired  for million  interests in three gulf of mexico lease blocks with recently drilled wells that were attributed proved reserves but which required additional development to commence production 
development plans for these properties are discussed later in this section 
also  on march  the company participated in winning bids for tracts at the central gulf of mexico lease sale held by the federal government s minerals management service mms 
if all tracts are awarded by the mms  which can choose to reject all bids for a given lease  the company s net share of the related leasehold bonuses will total approximately million 
during the past several years the company has been increasing its capital expenditures on exploration activities 
exploration activities generally have greater investment risk but a higher targeted rate of return than acquisition and development activities 
the range of possible investment outcomes is ordinarily much greater for exploration than for other oil and gas investments 
in the company began focusing its exploration activities in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  offshore louisiana and texas 
the company had conducted no previous operations in the area and began the period with no prospect inventory 
to conduct its gulf coast exploration activities the company formed a houston office staffed with experienced gulf coast geoscientists  engineers  and support personnel 
during its initial year of operations in the gulf coast area the company invested approximately million in related exploration activities  including costs relating to leaseholds that were unproved at december  but net of million of costs recouped through resale of partial interests in prospects to industry partners 
such investments primarily related to acquisitions of seismic data and mineral leaseholds  and participation in drilling four exploratory wells  two of which were successful 
because the successful wells were drilled late in the year  the company did not incur significant related development costs in the company s exploration plans for anticipate participation in five to ten new exploratory test wells  but only one such well has yet been scheduled and the actual number of test wells drilled may be more or less than anticipated 
the two successful wells noted above were drilled on eugene island ei blocks and  respectively 
both wells were attributed proved reserves as of december  but were categorized as undeveloped at that date because substantial future operations were required in order to make the wells capable of production 
the ei well is expected to commence production in the second quarter of after completion and tie in to a nearby production platform owned and operated by a third party 
it is expected that a production platform will be installed on the ei property in the third quarter of to produce the well and  if it is successful  the well which is currently drilling 
through the million acquisition consummated in february  the company increased its interests in ei blocks and the third property acquired was an interest in east cameron ec block a well on ec was completed subsea in january and is waiting on pipeline installation to connect to a nearby third party production platform 
initial production from ec is expected to commence during the third or fourth quarter of the company s capital budget for calendar  excluding acquisitions not already consummated  is approximately million  allocated as follows approximately million is provided for acquisitions of proved properties  approximately million is provided for acquisitions of prospect leaseholds  seismic data procurement  and exploratory drilling costs  approximately million relates to anticipated development of the company s existing property base  including ei  ei  ec  and the company s rocky mountain assets  and approximately million is provided for other activities  including current year development of assumed exploratory discoveries 
much of this budget is dependent on future developments that are not entirely within the company s control and which may not occur 
the company s actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from these estimates 
further  the company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of proved properties  primarily in the gulf coast and rocky mountain regions  which  while not budgeted  could be very significant 
management believes that the current year budget  as described above  can be funded without new sources of capital  by utilizing net working capital at the beginning of the period  projected cash flow  and borrowings under the revolving credit facility with the company s bank group 
cash flow is expected to increase significantly during the latter part of the year when ei and and ec are projected to be on line  however  these properties have not produced before and the forecast on line dates and production rates may not be achieved 
if conditions warrant  the company may consider raising additional capital through issuance of debt or equity securities 
should the company undertake a large acquisition  issuing such securities or monetizing assets would likely be required to fund the transaction 
in the absence of additional liquidity  the company s ability to fund investment activities in future periods will be significantly affected by the results obtained from investments made in changes in prices the company s revenue  cash flow  and the value of its oil and gas properties have been  and will continue to be  affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the company s ability to maintain current borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent on oil and natural gas prices 
as such  changes in oil and gas prices can significantly affect the amount of the company s capital expenditures 
oil and natural gas prices are subject to significant seasonal and other fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
the company periodically enters into product swap agreements in order to hedge against the volatility of product prices 
although the company enters into the agreements to limit exposure to price decreases  the agreements also limit the company s ability to benefit from significant price increases on the contract volumes 
effective july   the company entered into a crude oil swap agreement with a contract volume of  barrels per month through december  this agreement provides for the cash settlement of the differential between the per barrel contract price and the average closing nymex crude oil price during each month 
the company has also entered into a crude oil collar arrangement effective for calendar on an additional  barrels per month 
this agreement provides for the cash settlement of the differential between the monthly average closing nymex price and the contract floor of per barrel or the contract ceiling of per barrel  if the average monthly nymex price falls outside of the range defined by such contract floor and contract ceiling 
any gain or loss realized on these agreements is included as a component of oil sales in the month of production
