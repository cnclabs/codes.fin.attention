during fiscal year  the company did not make any menu price increases in order to increase or maintain profit margins 
the company expects that greater volume purchase discounts on food and supplies may be available in the future as the restaurant chain grows  which could partially offset the impact of any cost increases 
seasonality the company does not expect seasonality to affect its operations in a materially adverse manner 
however  the company s restaurant sales during its first and fourth fiscal quarters are generally higher than its second and third quarters due to the location of the majority of its restaurants in florida
