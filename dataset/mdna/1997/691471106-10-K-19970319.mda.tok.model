passage of this legislation could cause the company to reduce benefits or charge a premium under its medicare plans or require renegotiation of provider arrangements 
there is significant opposition to the proposed legislation  and the company cannot predict the outcome of the legislative process or the impact of reform on the company s results of operations 
the company currently expects a slight decrease in premium yields in its medicaid business in as a consequence of lower enrollment of higher yielding disabled beneficiaries in its pennsylvania medicaid plan than was originally anticipated

the company s profitability is dependent  in part  on its ability to predict and maintain effective control over health care costs through  among other things  appropriate benefit design  utilization review and case management programs and its case rate and risk sharing agreements with providers while providing members with quality health care 
factors such as utilization  new technologies and health care practices  hospital costs  major epidemics  inability to establish acceptable compensation agreements with providers and numerous other factors may affect oxford s ability to control such costs

there can be no assurance that oxford will be successful in mitigating the effect of any or all of the above listed or other factors

the liability is also affected by shared risk arrangements under private practice partnerships partnership 
in determining the liability for medical costs payable  the company accounts for the financial impact of the experience of risk sharing partnership providers who may be entitled to credits from oxford for favorable experience or subject to deductions for accrued deficits and  in the case of partnership providers subject to deficits  has established reserves to account for delays or other impediments to recovery of those deficits 
the company believes that its reserves for ibnr are adequate in order to satisfy its ultimate claim liability 
however  the company s rapid growth affects the company s ability to rely on historical information in making ibnr reserve estimates
