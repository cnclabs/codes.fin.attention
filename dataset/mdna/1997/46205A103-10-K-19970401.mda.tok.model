item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since its inception in  the company has grown primarily through the acquisition or management of radio and television broadcast stations and radio networks  as well as subsequent improvement in the operation of these properties 
certain of the company s radio and television stations were and continue to be operated under time brokerage agreements for various periods 
under time brokerage agreements  the stations operating revenues and expenses are controlled by the company and are included in its consolidated statements of operations 
the company operates three business segments intv  a nationwide network of owned  operated or affiliated television stations carrying its proprietary network  which broadcasts long form paid programming consisting primarily of infomercials  paxson radio  consisting of radio broadcasting stations  radio news and sports networks and billboard operations  and paxson network affiliated television  consisting of network affiliated television broadcasting stations in west palm beach  florida 
subsequent to december   the company entered into definitive agreements to sell its interests in its two network affiliated television stations serving the west palm beach  florida market for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the company s decision to sell these stations has resulted in the discontinuance of the network affiliated television segment for financial reporting purposes 
subsequent to december   the company contracted to sell its interests in woac tv  cleveland  ohio and wngm tv  atlanta  georgia  each of which is currently operated pursuant to time brokerage agreements  for aggregate consideration of million 
the company s operating data throughout the periods discussed have been impacted significantly by the timing and mix of radio  television and intv acquisitions throughout such periods 
operating revenues are derived from the sale of advertising to local and national advertisers 
the company s primary operating expenses involved in owning and operating paxson radio are syndicated program rights fees  commissions on revenues  employee salaries  news gathering  promotion and administrative expenses 
comparatively  operation of an intv station involves lower operating expenses relative to traditional network or independent television station operation 
as a result  the company s intv stations usually contribute to operating profit within a short time frame 
the costs of operating an intv station do not vary significantly with revenue  with the exception of costs associated with sales commissions and agency fees 
as such  upon obtaining a certain level of revenue sufficient to cover fixed costs  additional revenue levels have a significant impact on the operating results of an individual intv station 
the company s past results are not necessarily indicative of future performance due to various risks and uncertainties which may significantly reduce revenues and increase operating expenses 
for example  a reduction in expenditures by radio and television advertisers in the company s markets may result in lower revenues 
the company may be unable to reduce expenses  including certain variable expenses  in an amount sufficient in the short term to offset lost revenues caused by poor market conditions 
the broadcasting industry continues to undergo rapid technological change which may increase competition within the company s markets as new delivery systems  such as direct broadcast satellite and computer networks  attract customers 
the changing nature of audience tastes and viewing and listening habits may affect the continued attractiveness of the company s broadcasting stations to advertisers  upon whom the company is dependent for its revenue 
the company currently expects to continue acquiring additional stations which may have similar effects on the comparability of revenues  operating expenses  interest expense and operating cash flow as those described above 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount contingent or otherwise of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the fair values of the company s investments in broadcast properties and programming rights payable were based upon the net present value of applicable estimated future cash flows using a discounted rate approximating market rates 
the fair values of the company s long term debt and the notes were estimated based on market rates and instruments with similar risks and maturities 
the fair value estimates presented are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  as a result of the foregoing  the estimates presented in the company s financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange and have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of the company s financial statements

there are currently  options outstanding under these plans 
further  the company recognized option plan compensation expense of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and expects that approximately million of compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the outstanding options 
the company s primary capital requirements are for the acquisition of broadcasting properties and related capital expenditures and interest and principal payments on indebtedness 
the notes require semi annual interest payments at a fixed rate 
the company presently has million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility all of which has been drawn subsequent to december  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at floating rates and require interest payments on varying dates  but at least quarterly  depending on the interest rate option selected by the company 
the company believes that it may require additional financing to complete acquisitions which are currently pending 
the timing and amount of the company s additional financing needs will depend  among other things  upon the timing of the completion of the tv sales  the amount of net proceeds to the company from the tv sales estimated to be million after repayment of associated indebtedness and transaction expenses  prior to making any payments under the credit facility required by virtue of the tv sales or payment of taxes  whether the company completes a sale of its billboard operations and the timing and net proceeds thereof  the timing of closings of pending acquisitions which are dependent upon the satisfaction of closing conditions  some of which are beyond the control of the company  and the amount of borrowing capacity available to the company under the credit facility

the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility will be affected by changes in the company s cash flow position  including cash flow generated by acquired stations and cash flow reductions from station sales 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to borrow additional funds under the credit facility 
as there is no assurance that the timing of asset sales will be adequate to meet the closing dates for acquisitions  the company is considering additional sources of financing  including public and private sales of equity and debt securities 
the company will require additional financing to enable it to continue its acquisition strategy and to fund capital expenditures on existing and acquired properties and the company s working capital requirements 
the failure to raise funds necessary to finance the company s future cash requirements could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue its business strategy 
in addition  should the company suffer a significant impairment to its cash flow from operations due to the occurrence of one or more adverse events  the company could have insufficient resources to repay indebtedness under the credit facility or the notes when due or to make required payments on the preferred stock
