during the year ended december   in addition to the million described above  the company received approximately  from the exercise of stock options and  from the exercise of stock warrants 
prior to the ipo and the secondary offering  the company financed its operations primarily through private sales of its equity securities  issuances of convertible debt  and license and development fees 
through december   the company had received net offering proceeds from private sales of equity securities and issuance of convertible notes of approximately million and had generated licenses and development fees of approximately million

major uses of cash during the year ended december   included research and development expenses of million  capital expenditures of million for property and equipment and the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock for  during the next several years  the company expects to commit a significant amount of its cash flow to capital expenditures and for research and development activities at both its present virginia facilities and its new international facilities in ireland 
the company estimates that capital expenditures of approximately million will be required in such expenditures will be used to acquire an administrative office facility in dublin  ireland during january  the company purchased such a facility for approximately million and to continue to upgrade and significantly expand its research facilities to comply with pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices gmp standards 
such expenditures will also include the continued development of gmp pilot scale and production scale tablet production lines and a pilot scale gmp facility for producing and coating microspheres 
these research and production facilities will be used in connection with the company s otc and controlled release activities 
in addition  the company expects to use these capital expenditures to develop a production scale facility for producing food products utilizing the company s technology 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial expenses related to further research and development of its technologies and products  increased staffing levels  acquisition and support of patent rights  additional capital equipment for research and development activities and facility expansion 
the company estimates that it may spend approximately million during for product research and development activities not funded by the company s collaborative partners 
during the next several years  the company will periodically evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that extend or enhance the company s current business and line of products 
in november  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock for reissuance upon the exercise of employee stock options and for other compensation programs utilizing the company s stock 
the company expects to incur additional losses in the near term 
the company expects that  at least for the near term  its revenues will be derived principally from development and license fees and  to a lesser extent  royalties from collaborative partners 
in addition  pending disbursement for capital expenditures and working capital  the company expects to realize income from the investment of the funds generated in its public offerings 
the company believes that the currently available funds and internally generated cash flow  will be adequate to meet the company s cash needs through fiscal year the company s capital needs  however  will depend on many factors  including continued progress in the research and development of the company s technologies  the ability of the company to establish and maintain additional collaborative agreements with others and the terms thereof  payment received from collaborative partners under research and development agreements  the cost involved in filing and enforcing patent claims  the status of competitive products and other factors 
if the company s currently available funds and internally generated cash flow are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  the company would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  through bank borrowings and through public or private sales of its securities  including equity securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to the company on favorable terms 
the company has not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income were approximately million 
the company s total net operating loss carryforwards of million include million which  when realized  will not affect financial statement income  but will be recorded directly to stockholders equity 
because the company has experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce federal income tax liabilities 
risk factors the company wishes to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
history of operating losses and accumulated deficit the company has incurred net losses in each year since its inception  including net losses of approximately million during the year ended december  these losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of million at december  the company expects to incur additional losses in the near term 
the company s ability to generate significant revenue and become profitable will be dependent in large part on the ability of the company to enter into additional collaborative agreements and on the ability of the company and its collaborators to successfully commercialize products incorporating the company s technologies 
no assurance can be given that the company will ever generate significant revenue or become profitable 
products in development state to date  only the company s chewing gum flavoring systems have been incorporated in commercially available consumer products  and the company has not realized significant revenues from product sales or royalties 
most of the company s potential product applications are in the research or development stage 
the company s operating revenue from inception through december  of approximately million has consisted principally of research and development fees and license fees 
to achieve profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully complete development of its products  obtain necessary regulatory approvals  complete manufacturing scale up and introduce and market its products 
product commercialization a major component of the company s strategy is to leverage its proprietary technology to develop and commercialize its own products 
such products include those that are subject to existing development and license agreements where the company has retained co exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights to the end user products 
the company intends initially to formulate and pursue manufacturing and marketing of otc and prescription pharmaceutical products 
the development of commercial scale manufacturing facilities and marketing efforts by the company will require significant commitments of capital by the company 
the company has no manufacturing experience and has no experience with marketing products commercially 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully develop such experience  or that the company s products will be accepted in the marketplace 
commercialization efforts by the company may compete with activities of the company s collaborative partners  most of whom have greater financial resources than the company 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s active pursuit of its own efforts to commercialize products using the company s proprietary technology will not otherwise adversely affect the company s relations with its existing and potential collaborative partners 
limited manufacturing experience  risk of manufacturing scale up products incorporating the company s technology have not been manufactured by the company or by its collaborative partners on a commercial scale  except for the company s chewing gum flavoring systems 
the company currently plans to retain rights to manufacture commercial quantities of pharmaceutical compounds processed using the company s microsphere technology 
the company has no experience manufacturing products for commercial purposes 
the company is currently developing the facilities required for such manufacturing activities and the company will be required to substantially increase its manufacturing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the company or its collaborative partners will be able to successfully develop commercial scale manufacturing facilities and develop or design in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost the equipment necessary to manufacture products utilizing the company s technology 
moreover  in connection with the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and food ingredient products  the company and its collaborative partners will be required to adhere to current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations enforced by the us food and drug administration fda through its facilities inspection program 
the company and its collaborative partners also will be required to comply with manufacturing standards prescribed by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries 
there can be no assurance that manufacturing and control problems will not arise as the company or its collaborative partners begin to scale up manufacturing facilities or that manufacturing can be scaled up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost to enable production in sufficient quantities 
dependence upon collaborative partners although the company is undertaking development and commercialization of its own products  another major component of the company s strategy is to enter into collaborative arrangements with other companies which will market and manufacture products incorporating the company s technology 
the company expects that  at least for the foreseeable future  its revenues will be derived principally from the development fees  license fees and royalties from collaborative partners 
the company s prospects are  therefore  in part dependent upon the company s ability to attract and retain collaborative partners and to develop technologies and products that meet the requirements of such collaborative partners 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing or future collaborative arrangements will result in successful product commercialization 
the company will also be dependent upon the marketing efforts  manufacturing capabilities and regulatory approval efforts of its collaborative partners 
the company anticipates that most licensees will be given the exclusive or co exclusive right to market products incorporating the company s technology for a particular class of products for a particular territory  and the amount and timing of resources to be devoted by them to marketing are not within the control of the company 
no assurance of product licenses  other risks associated with collaborative agreements the company has entered into development agreements with collaborative partners for products using the company s technologies 
pursuant to these agreements  the company typically agrees to develop product prototypes for the collaborative partner s evaluation 
in many cases  the company expects that a definitive license agreement for the manufacture and marketing of a product or products will be entered into at the same time as the development agreements relating to such product 
in other cases the collaborative partner may be granted an option to enter into a license agreement at a later date  and  in such cases  the collaborative partner will not be obligated to enter into a license agreement with the company 
in any event  a collaborative partner will generally have the right to abandon a product  and consequently to terminate funding  at any time and for any reason without penalty 
collaborative partners will also generally be free to market products using drug delivery or other technologies that are competitive with those of the company 
a decision by a collaborative partner to abandon one or more of its products incorporating the company s technology or to adopt a competing technology could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s license agreements currently in effect generally provide  and it is expected future license agreements will generally provide  for the company to receive a payment at the time of execution of the agreement  additional scheduled payments or payments upon attainment of certain milestones and royalty payments based on net sales of products by the licensee 
the timing and amount of such payments will fluctuate  and such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s cash position and results of operations 
in addition  royalty rates for licenses of the company s technology for otc products are expected  consistent with industry practices  to be lower than royalty rates for licenses relating to prescription products 
patents and proprietary rights the company s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
the company has been granted us patents and has filed a substantial number of applications for additional us patents  as well as corresponding patent applications outside the united states  relating to the company s technology 
there can be no assurance that any of the pending patent applications will be approved  that the company will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable  that any patents issued to the company will provide the company with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating the company s technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of the company s products or  if patents are issued to the company  design around the company s patents 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on the company 
government regulation and product approval manufacturing and sales of products and potential products by the company and its collaborative partners may be subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
although the nature and extent of regulation varies by type of product  in general  products must meet standards regarding safety and efficacy  manufacturing practices  labeling and purity 
in addition  certain products must receive fda approval prior to marketing 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers  including the power to withhold approvals of new products  to initiate product recalls  to seize products  to delay or prevent product sales and to halt operations
