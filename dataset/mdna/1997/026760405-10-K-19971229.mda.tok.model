when used in this document  the words anticipate  believe  estimate and expect and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the actual results or outcomes could differ materially from those discussed in the particular forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  developments and results of the company s business include  but may not be limited to  the following international  national and regional economic conditions  market acceptance of the company s products and services  the company s ability to provide integrated communication solutions for customers in a dynamic industry  as well as competitive factors 
the company s fiscal year ends september fiscal refers to the twelve months ended september  with similar references for other twelve month periods ending september pursuant to activities initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company maintained its focus on improving its overall cash flow 
throughout fiscal  the company implemented various cost cutting activities in each of its three business segments 
the company believes that these activities have allowed it to strengthen the operations in what the company believes to be its two mature segments  the telecommunication and document management segments  as well as to better position what the company believes to be its start up segment  the internet services segment  for the future success and contribution of its operations 
execution of the company s strategy of focusing on profit margins and eliminating excess costs resulted in enhanced profit margins in both the document management and the telecommunication segments 
industry experienced management teams in both segments were able to significantly reduce overhead expense by consolidating back office administration and implementing various other cost cutting activities 
the internet services segment concentrated on expanding both its customer base  as well as its product and service offerings 
during fiscal  the internet services segment announced its new  national internet service offering  the isp channel 
the company expects this segment to continue to increase its customer base and market presence through its promotion of the isp channel 
the company believes that significant market opportunities may exist for this business and its current product and service offerings 
these opportunities  however  may require a capital investment in excess of the company s current operating cash flow and lines of credit 
the company also believes that the successful launching of the isp channel may require substantial investment which could have an adverse effect on short term operating results 
overall  the company expects to continue its focus on increasing cash flow in the business segments and expects to continue its investment towards increasing its customer base in each of its markets 
the company also expects to continue its investment in new product development 
the company also understands that future product offerings may require substantial investment in new sales personnel and retraining of current technical personnel  which the company believes may have an adverse effect on the short term operating results 
although the company has organized itself into three segments  the only industry segment comparison to prior years which would be meaningful is a comparison of the document management and telecommunication segments for fiscal and fiscal the internet segment only contributed to consolidated operating results for one quarter in fiscal and comparison for prior years would not be meaningful 
similarly  the majority of the document management segment was acquired in late fiscal and only contributed fifteen days of operating results to fiscal therefore any comparison for this segment to fiscal would also not be meaningful
