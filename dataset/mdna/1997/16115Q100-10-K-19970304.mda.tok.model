management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in  chart industries experienced a percent increase in net income over the prior year 
a large portion of this increase can be attributed to a strong demand for air separation equipment  including heat exchangers  cold boxes  cryogenic tanks and assorted system components 
in addition to the air separation equipment  the company is about one third complete on the ligo project  its largest contract thus far which totaled million 
as to order bookings  the company has seen a tremendous increase in the demand for hydrocarbon processing equipment 
new orders in this area were million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
due to the longer lead time on this equipment  the company is just beginning to see the effect on sales 
backlog in this area now totals million with an estimated gross margin of percent 
the consolidated backlog of million  another new high for the company  with an estimated gross margin of percent  should allow for a strong in which the company will strive again to exceed its internal growth targets and continue to look for acquisition candidates to enhance that growth

the large pick up in orders the company has received related to the natural gas processing market will be seen in increased sales during and into sales to the cryogenic high vacuum market increased in much of the sales improvement in this market is the result of vacuum equipment being supplied to the ligo project  which totalled approximately million during gross profit for increased million or percent from levels 
the gross margin percentage increased from percent in to percent in as in sales  a large portion of the improvement in both gross profit and in margin percentage came from the air separation sector 
the most dramatic improvement was the cryogenic tank area at pei  which has fully turned around after the restructuring  and when coupled with increasing prices  has gone from a negative gross margin to a margin level comparable to the whole market area 
also seeing large volume and price improvement in was the brazed aluminum heat exchanger market 
as the ligo job progresses toward completion  it is having a positive effect in the cryogenic high vacuum equipment area  where the margin percentage has grown to percent from percent 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs totaled million for  an increase of million from however  as a percentage of sales  sg a has decreased from percent in to percent in this improvement is the result of increasing volume relative to the fixed overheads 
the million increase in expense is largely driven by the variable expenses of profit sharing  management incentive compensation and selling commissions  which are all closely tied to increasing profitability and sales levels 
in addition  outside consultants are working with the company in efforts to increase throughput in various facilities  the costs for which have been included in sg a 
net interest expense declined during with borrowings declining from million to a net positive cash position 
this was also the last year of amortization for the loan origination costs related to the million credit agreement 
the tax expense includes the positive effect of eliminating the deferred tax valuation allowance that related to certain tax loss carryforwards as well as the ongoing benefits of several different tax credits

years ended december  and sales for were million versus million for  an increase of million  or percent 
sales grew across all markets and received an additional boost from the acquisition of cvi in the fourth quarter of the continued strong demand for stainless steel tubing  brazed aluminum heat exchangers and cryogenic storage tanks  was partially offset by a weak market and poor contract performance in the high vacuum area 
the company has decided to focus on large thermal vacuum systems and optical coating systems and exit the small vacuum coating systems market 
these changes in emphasis during should improve this area s performance in and beyond 
strong air separation market conditions  extensive productivity improvements at pei  demand for redraw stainless steel tubing  and strong throughput at each of chart s plants resulted in gross profit for of million versus million for  an improvement of million  or percent 
this result reflects an improved gross profit margin to percent from percent in the products supporting this improved margin performance were stainless steel tubing  brazed aluminum heat exchangers and cryogenic storage tanks 
this improved performance more than compensated for the anticipated low margin sales in several long term high vacuum projects and the start up costs of our chart coastal fabrication facility in new iberia  louisiana 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative sg a expense improved to percent versus percent in sg a expense for was million  approximately million higher than the addition of cvi increased sg a expense by million over last year 
the remaining increases are driven by higher commissions and employee profit sharing 
net interest expense for was million versus million in increased interest charges in reflect higher borrowing levels to meet increased working capital requirements of the company s operating units and the acquisition indebtedness related to cvi 
as of october   the differential to libor at which chart borrows from its bank group was lowered by basis points to libor plus basis points

the company is currently well positioned in regards to working capital despite the large backlog and related inventory needs due to strong progress billings to chart s customers and strong net income 
capital expenditures in   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the capital expenditures relate to the expansion of capacity at both altec and chart coastal fabrication ccf  as well as general throughput enhancing expenditures at the other locations 
the expenditures included the leasehold improvements and various machinery and equipment purchases for the company s initial operation at ccf  along with various productivity enhancing machinery and equipment throughout all of chart s facilities
