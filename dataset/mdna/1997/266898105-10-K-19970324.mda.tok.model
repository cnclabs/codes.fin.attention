item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the financial information included herein should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements contained therein 
general the company is a development stage pharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the development of proprietary methods of photodynamic therapy pdt and photodiagnosis pd utilizing ala 
the development program for actinic keratosis is at the phase iii stage and at the phase i or phase ii stage for various other indications 
see business company s products and technology 
since its inception  the company has primarily devoted its resources to funding research and development and as a result the company has experienced significant operating losses 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the company s development program is being implemented by its management with the assistance of consultants  primarily guidelines and lumenetics 
the current agreement with guidelines expired december  and the company is in the process of negotiating a new contract 
the company continues to use the services of guidelines under the same terms as the expired agreement 
if for any reason the parties are unable to come to mutually agreeable terms  the company believes that it could contract with other firms to perform the services provided by guidelines 
however  there is no guarantee that the company could replace guidelines without causing a delay to the company s clinical programs and without an increase in costs 
the company has an agreement with lumenetics expiring april  see notes g to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year the company filed for and obtained approval to be de listed from the toronto stock exchange tse 
the company concluded that the volume of trading on the tse  and the change in relationship with draxis see below did not justify the expense of being listed on the tse 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its development stage operations primarily from sales of securities in public offerings 
in may  the company completed a public offering in which  shares of its common stock were sold at per share  resulting in the company receiving  which was net of offering costs of  in december  the company had sold  shares of its common stock at per share  and received  which was net of offering costs of   of the proceeds from the december offering were used to repurchase options held by draxis see repurchase of options below 
as of december   the company s total assets  consisting primarily of united states government securities available for sale  were  as compared to  as of december  the company s united states government securities available for sale have an aggregate cost of  and a current aggregate market value of  as of december   resulting in a net unrealized loss on securities available for sale of  provision for which has been charged to shareholders equity 
at december   the aggregate cost was  and had a market value of  resulting in an unrealized gain of  the market value of the company s government securities fluctuates  with changes in interest rates in the united states from the time these securities were acquired 
some losses could be realized  depending upon the timing of the company s need to convert government securities into cash to meet its working capital requirements 
the company s us government securities currently have yields ranging from to  and maturity dates ranging from january  to august  as of december  the company s us government securities had yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to march  the company has invested its funds in liquid investments  so that it will have ready access to its cash reserves as needed for the funding of its development plan on a short term and long term basis 
as of december   the company had current liabilities of  as compared to  as of december   an increase of  due primarily to an increase in research and development activities  more specifically  due to the commencement of phase iii trials on actinic keratosis 
since its inception  the company has had no long term debt  nor does it have any plans to enter into any such financial arrangements 
in conjunction with parteq  the company recently requested that the united states patent and trademark office pto reexamine two of the four parteq patents in order to incorporate additional references 
as to one of the patents  the pto agreed to incorporate the references without reexamination 
the reexamination of the other patent is proceeding  but the company believes that the process can be brought to a close without significant changes to the claims 
in any reexamination proceeding  however  there is a risk that the claims under consideration will be narrowed or canceled 
any such narrowing or cancellation of patent rights could have a significant adverse effect on the company s anticipated competitive positive in the marketplace 
the company believes it has sufficient capital resources to proceed with its current development program for ala pdt pd 
management is currently focusing initial clinical trials on a limited number of indications to enhance the company s ability to complete the regulatory process for ak s and bladder cancer diagnosis  but full development and testing of all potential indications which are currently under development would require additional funding 
as the development of ala pdt continues  the company may adjust its priorities on how the funds are allocated to research and development of indications for ala pdt under consideration 
the timing of the expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  competitive developments  payments under any collaborative arrangements  if any  entered into by the company and the availability of alternate financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that such funds will be sufficient to enable the company to obtain regulatory marketing approval or to market any product for any indications currently under development 
therefore  there is no way to predict the timing or magnitude of the revenues from the marketing of the company s product or whether any such revenues will be realized 
consequently  in order to maintain continuing research and development programs  it may be desirable or necessary to raise additional funds through future financings  corporate alliances or other sources 
the company may also use its resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  technologies  or products that enhance or expand the company s business 
during  the company was engaged in discussions related to certain such opportunities 
while the company concluded that certain of the transactions were not in the company s best interest  other negotiations are on going 
the company will be actively seeking relationships with pharmaceutical or other suitable organizations to market the company s products and technologies  or provide funding for research projects 
to date  the company has not made any acquisition or arrangement of such nature 
relationship with draxis prior to the company s public offering in december  draxis owned approximately million shares of the company s common stock and held options draxis options to purchase million shares of the company at an exercise price of per share  expiring in september the underwriter of the offering believed that the draxis options might adversely impact the possible appreciation of the company s common stock 
accordingly  draxis offered to sell the draxis options at an aggregate price of  or per option 
the company had appointed an independent monitoring committee committee  consisting of two directors of the company to evaluate the offer to repurchase the draxis options 
the committee retained an investment banking firm to provide an opinion as to the fairness of the offer to the shareholders of the company other than draxis and legal counsel to advise the committee 
the investment banking firm rendered its opinion to the committee that repurchasing the draxis option at the price of per option would be fair to the shareholders of the company other than draxis from a financial point of view 
based upon this opinion  the committee concluded that the offer was fair  and presented it to the company s board of directors 
the company s board of directors  after assessing the risks and benefits associated with the proposed transaction  unanimously authorized the acceptance of the offer to purchase the draxis option  contingent upon the company s sale of the maximum shares of common stock in the offering 
two members of the board  who were present but who also served at that time as members of the board of directors of draxis  abstained from voting on this action 
the company repurchased the draxis options on december  in february  at the request of draxis  the company filed a registration statement to dispose of all of the  shares of common stock of the company owned by draxis 
in march  draxis disposed of its entire interest in the shares of the company 
draxis no longer owns any shares of common stock or other securities in the company 
the company did not participate in the offering 
as a result of this transaction  certain relationships between the company and draxis were changed during in order to disentangle the two companies 
prior to the closing of the march offering  three directors of draxis  including draxis and the company s presidents  served on the company s board of directors 
in addition  the company s president served as the chairman of the board of draxis  and the company s chief financial officer served as vice president and chief financial officer of draxis 
upon the completion of the offering  the president of draxis resigned from the company s board of directors and the chief financial officer of the company resigned 
in addition  the president of the company resigned as director and chairman of the board of draxis upon the appointment of a successor to this position by the draxis board of directors on march  only one director  mr 
james doherty  who is a former officer of draxis and the company  remains on the board of directors of both draxis and the company 
the company s president has assumed the duties of the chief financial officer until the company has recruited a qualified person for this position 
the company expects that it will be able to hire a qualified replacement as chief financial officer  but not at the same rate to that previously paid to draxis for the services provided by its chief financial officer 
since the company s initial public offering  prior to which it was a wholly owned subsidiary of draxis  the company had utilized the services of certain draxis employees pursuant to the draxis management agreement whereby draxis employees provided administrative  financial  scientific and marketing support  and other management services which were required by the company 
the company was charged a per diem rate for services provided by draxis employees  plus out pocket expenses 
the per diem rates for and ranged from cdn 
to cdn 
 the rates depended upon the person providing the services and were equal to the annual salary and benefits  expressed as a rate per day  paid by draxis to such employees 
charges related to the draxis management agreement for these services were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  on december  the company notified draxis that it was terminating the management agreement effective as of february  the change in relationship with draxis will result in increase operating costs for the company as it recruits personnel for services which had previously been provided by draxis 
on november  the company relocated its canadian office from space rented from draxis in mississauga  ontario to toronto  ontario 
the company had rented approximately  square feet of office space from draxis at a rate of cdn  per month 
the new office premises comprises  square feet at a rental of cdn 
 per month 
the lease for the new premises expires in november pursuant to a lease  which expires in august   the company s subsidiary  dusa pharmaceuticals new york  inc  leases  square feet of office space in tarrytown  new york 
lease payments for for both locations totaled  and future minimum lease payments will total approximately  in  and  in which do not include rent for dusa pharmaceuticals new york  inc subsequent to september  the company anticipates that it has sufficient office facilities for the near future  which could be modified as required 
the company has ten full time employees and one part time employee 
the company has retained a senior financial consultant as of august to assist the company with certain financial management responsibilities 
the company is conducting a search for a new permanent cfo 
the company has also retained numerous independent consultants such as guidelines and lumenetics  and the services of key researchers at leading university centers whose activities are coordinated by the company s employees 
at least six persons employed at guidelines and lumenetics devote a significant amount of their time to the company s projects 
other employees and consultants will be hired by the company as needed 
the company has not made and does not expect to make material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the near term 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  or any assurance that the operations  business or assets of the company will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
see business government regulation 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  the company has had no sales to date 
at the current time  the company s most advanced clinical program in ala pdt is for actinic keratoses 
the company completed the necessary phase ii studies in  and subsequent to meeting with the fda  commenced two phase iii clinical pivotal trials in december depending on a satisfactory rate of enrollment  the company estimates that phase iii will be completed by late summer and the nda will be filed as soon as feasible thereafter 
however  delays at any stage of the clinical program could cause a detrimental effect on the company s financial condition as operating expenses continue to accrue during the clinical trial process prior to any approval to market a product 
the company also intends to begin its own multi center trial for the photodiagnosis of bladder cancer 
the company plans to develop a system in which ala is delivered to the bladder  followed by visual examination with an endoscopic device attached to a specialized light source 
the company is currently in negotiations to secure appropriate light devices 
once these negotiations are completed  the company will be in a position to submit an ind to the fda for phase i ii clinical trials  anticipated to begin in the first half of the company has been developing plans for further clinical trials in acne and hair removal 
in addition  the company continued its pilot work on endometrial ablation  by supporting an investigator ind 
see business company s products and technology 
the company currently believes it has sufficient funds to develop its two lead indications for ala pdt through the nda filing process and to continue development of its secondary indications as planned 
the company may  however  enter into joint development or licensing arrangements  both domestically and internationally  with pharmaceutical companies  in which it will seek to have the other companies assume certain of the costs of clinical testing and of obtaining regulatory marketing approval for the products licensed 
to the extent that the company is unable to enter into such arrangements  it may require separate funding to complete the regulatory approval process 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient funds to obtain approval of any product  that any product will be successfully developed  proven to be safe and effective in necessary pivotal clinical trials  or receive applicable regulatory marketing approvals 
therefore  there is no way to predict the timing or magnitude of the revenues from the marketing of the company s product or whether any such revenues will be realized 
in order to maintain various current and future research and development programs  it may be desirable or necessary in the future to raise additional funds through financings  corporate alliances or other sources 
interest income of  for the year ended december   earned primarily on united states government securities  increased from  for the year ended december   primarily due to the interest earned on the net proceeds of the company s stock offerings in december  and may interest income for the cumulative period from february  date of incorporation to december  was  interest income  the only significant source of income at the current time  is expected to decline as funds are expended for research and development programs 
research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in costs reflects the completion of multiple multi center phase ii trials for ak  development of protocols for bladder indication trials and preparation of phase iii clinical trials for ak 
as the company continues to develop its indications for regulatory approval  research and development costs are expected to increase approximately above expenditures 
total research and development costs for the cumulative period from february  date of incorporation to december  were  costs and development fees associated with agreements for research projects and clinical studies commit the company to make payments during of  see business other contractual relationships 
draxis had performed certain research and development functions for the company in respect of which draxis has applied for canadian tax incentives 
draxis has informed the company that  for the years ended december   and  these incentives totaled approximately cdn 
 cdn 
 and cdn 
 respectively 
effective october   the company assigned its rights and obligations under the license agreement with parteq to draxis  insofar as they relate to canada 
draxis has agreed to pay directly to parteq of all future lump sums payable under the license agreement together with royalties which would otherwise be payable to the company in accordance with the license agreement with respect to net canadian sales of products 
in addition  draxis agreed to reimburse the company of all lump sums previously paid by the company to parteq under the license agreement and to pay to the company a royalty of of net canadian sales of products 
at this time  no changes to the assignment agreement between the company and draxis are contemplated 
operating expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  operating expenses increased as a result of hiring of additional personnel  investor relations expenditures  and activities related to identifying and examining potential strategic alliances for its business 
operating costs are expected to increase in the future as the company continues to add personnel including the hiring of a chief financial officer and other persons to replace services previously provided by draxis 
on february  the company s board of directors  subject to shareholder and regulatory approval  extended the term of certain restricted stock options granted prior to august from five years to ten years 
the ten year term is now comparable to the term of all the options granted under the company s existing omnibus plan 
the excess of the market value of the common stock over the exercise price of the extended term stock options of  has been recorded as an addition to common stock and the related compensation expense has been recorded 
this transaction does not have a cash impact on the company but has increased the net loss for the year ended december  by approximately 
per share 
the company incurred a net loss of  or per share  for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of  or 
per share  for the year ended december  net losses for the cumulative period from february  date of incorporation to december  were  or per share 
such losses are consistent with the company s expectations and the company anticipates that losses will continue throughout the development stage 
the company expects to incur additional operating losses over the next several years and expects cumulative losses to increase as the company s research and development and clinical trial efforts expand 
the company s revenues to date have been limited and substantially all of the company s revenues have consisted of interest income 
to achieve profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully develop  manufacture and market proprietary products 
there is no way to accurately predict the timing or magnitude of revenues from the marketing of ala pdt for any indication or whether any revenues will ever be realized 
effective january the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
requires increased disclosure of compensation expense arising from both fixed and performance stock compensation plans 
such expense is measured as the fair value of the award at the date it is granted using an option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price and expected term of the option  the current price of the underlying stock  its expected volatility  expected dividends on the stock and the expected risk free rate of return during the term of the option 
the compensation cost is recognized over the service period  usually the period from the grant date to the vesting date 
sfas no 
encourages rather than requires  companies to adopt a new method that accounts for stock compensation awards based on their estimated fair value at the date they are granted 
companies are permitted  however  to continue accounting under apb opinion no 
 which requires compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans to be recognized based on the difference  if any  between the quoted market price of the stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the company continues to apply apb opinion no 
in its financial statements and has disclosed proforma net loss and loss per share in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ending december   determined as if the company had applied the new method 
year ended december  versus year ended december  interest income of  for the year ended december   earned primarily on united states government securities  declined from  for the year ended december   as fewer funds were available for investment prior to the consummation of the december offering 
research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in expense reflected the expansion of controlled clinical trials for ala pdt 
during  the company advanced its development program for the same indications being researched in operating expenses were  for the year ended december   consistent with operating expenses of  for the year ended december  the company incurred a net loss of  or

per share  for the year ended december  year ended december  versus year ended december  for the year ended december  interest income earned on the company s portfolio of united states government securities was  as compared to  for the year ended december  interest income declined as these securities were converted to cash to meet working capital requirements 
during the third quarter of the company reviewed its portfolio of united states government securities and  believing that over the longer term the yield to the company of a professionally managed portfolio would outperform the yield that would be obtained with an internally managed portfolio  the company engaged the services of us trust of california us trust 
us trust immediately sold the existing portfolio and reinvested the proceeds in other united states government securities  which more closely reflected its then current investment strategies  incurring a gain of  in the process 
shortly thereafter  the bond market started to decline  which continued during as a result  the market value of the company s united states government securities portfolio was continuously below book value throughout thus  when portions of the portfolio were liquidated during the year to meet the company s cash requirements  certain losses were incurred which  in  amounted to  on december   the market value of the company s portfolio of united states government securities was  below book value 
as a result  the company recorded a provision for unrealized losses of this amount in its consolidated statements of operations 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the statement requires the company to record securities which management has classified as available for sale at fair market value and to record unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of sfas no 
resulted in the reversal of the unrealized losses of  which had been previously recorded through operations for the year ended december  as reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  under the caption cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
as of december   the company s securities available for sale were recorded at fair market value of  and the unrealized loss on such securities of  was recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
during  the company continued to invest in its research and development program  including its programs for aks and psoriasis  spending  for research and development for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  based on the company s initial studies at the time  as well as regulatory and marketing considerations  the company believed that its funds should be focused primarily on development of aks and psoriasis  with development of bccs as finances allow 
the company proceeded with pilot studies using ala pdt in acne  and for hair removal  each being dermatology applications with large market potential 
in addition  the company continued its pilot work on endometrial ablation 
as the research and development program expanded  the company s operating expenses increased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of approximately from to reflected a full year of us trust management fees  investor relations fees and increased personnel 
these increases were consistent with management s expectations 
on a per share basis  the net loss for the year ended december  was 
per share  as compared to 
per share for the year ended december inflation although inflation rates have been comparatively low in recent years  inflation is expected to apply upward pressure on the operating costs of the company 
the company has included an inflation factor in its cost estimates  however the overall net effect of inflation on the operations of the company should be minimal
