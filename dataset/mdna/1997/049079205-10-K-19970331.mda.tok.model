item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s revenues and income from continuing operations are derived principally from the operations of its telephone subsidiaries  vitelco and gt t 
vitelco derives most of its revenues from local telephone and long distance access services 
gt t derives almost all of its revenues from international telephone services 
other operations in the company s consolidated statements of operations include vitelcellular  which provides cellular telephone service in the us virgin islands  and vitelcom  which supplies customer premises equipment in the us virgin islands 
the principal components of operating expenses for the company s telephone operations are plant specific operations expenses  plant non specific operations expenses  customer operations expenses  corporate operations expenses  long distance expenses and taxes other than income taxes 
these categories are consistent with fcc accounting practices 
plant specific operations expenses relate to support and maintenance of telephone plant and equipment and include vehicle expense  land and building expense  central office switching expense and cable and wire expense 
plant non specific operations expenses consist of depreciation charges for telephone plant and equipment and expenses related to telephone plant and network administration  engineering  power  materials and supplies  provisioning and plant network testing 
customer operations expenses relate to marketing  providing operator services for call completion and directory assistance  and establishing and servicing customer accounts 
corporate operations expenses include vitelco s and gt t s expenses for executive management and administration  corporate planning  accounting and finance  external relations  personnel  labor relations  data processing  legal services  procurement and general insurance 
international long distance expenses consist principally of charges from international carriers for outbound international calls from guyana and payments to audiotext providers from whom gt t derives international audiotext traffic 
taxes other than income taxes include gross receipts taxes  property taxes  and other miscellaneous taxes 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues from telephone operations for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million 
the increase was due principally to a million increase in audiotext traffic revenues at gt t and a million increase in local exchange and access charges at vitelco for the year ended december  vitelco s telephone operations revenues increased million for the year ended december   principally as a result of restored lines in service to pre hurricane marilyn levels 
hurricane marilyn struck the virgin islands putting approximately  of vitelco s approximately  access lines out of service on september  at december  vitelco had  lines in service 
consolidated telephone operating expenses increased million for the year ended december  this increase was due principally to increases in audiotext and outbound traffic expenses at gt t of million due to increased traffic volume 
as a result of a rate decrease ordered by the guyana puc on october   gt t s outbound international traffic has increased by approximately during the year ended december  resulting in an approximately million increase in outbound traffic expenses 
an additional factor contributing to the increase in consolidated telephone operating expenses was plant specific expense which increased as a result of increased plant in service  although certain expenses at vitelco were reduced in the first quarter of as vitelco s work force was shifted from maintenance activities to repairing the damage caused by hurricane marilyn 
overall  income from telephone operations decreased million for the year ended december  the decrease occurred principally because of negative margins on outbound traffic at gt t which in turn  was caused principally by rate decreases ordered by the puc in october in january  the guyana high court voided the puc s order and permitted gt t to restore its rates for outbound traffic to their pre october level 
while these rates are also less than the associated outbound expense  had these rates been in effect throughout  the company estimates that gt t s income from telephone operations in would have been approximately million greater than it was  assuming gt t s volume of traffic remained unchanged 
audiotext traffic increased million minutes and other gt t inbound paid and outcollect traffic increased million minutes for the year ended december  these revenue increases at gt t were more than offset by increased international long distance  plant  and other operating expenses 
this resulted in a decrease in gt t s contribution to income from telephone operations of million for the year ended december  this was offset by a million increase in the contribution to income from telephone operations at vitelco caused by the restoration of lines in service after hurricane marilyn s impact discussed above 
gt t s audiotext traffic increased sharply in the first months of hitting a peak of million minutes for the month of august since then audiotext traffic has fluctuated between approximately million and million minutes per month 
audiotext is a highly competitive business  and gt t may experience significant increases or decreases in the volume of its audiotext traffic during profit margins from this traffic decreased approximately in principally due to a shift in traffic mix to less profitable countries and reductions some in accounting rates 
in addition  margins are expected to decrease in as certain foreign carriers insist that terminating carriers of audiotext traffic bear a portion of the risk of non collection associated with such traffic 
income before minority interest decreased million for the year ended december  the significant factors that contributed to this for the year ended december  were i the million decrease in income from telephone operations discussed above  ii a  decrease in net interest expense due to decreased interest rates and lower outstanding debt  iii a  net decrease in other non operating revenue and expense  iv a million decrease in income tax expense  principally due to lower taxable income at gt t which has a higher effective tax rate than the balance of the company 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the minority interest in earnings consists primarily of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
years ended december  and revenues from telephone operations for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million 
the increases were due to a million increase in audiotext traffic revenues at gt t for the year ended december  vitelco s telephone operations revenues decreased million for the year ended december   principally as a result of hurricane marilyn which put approximately  of vitelco s approximately  access lines out of service on september  see business vitelco 
at december  vitelco had  lines in service 
principally as a result of the impact of hurricane marilyn on vitelco s lines in service in the fourth quarter of  vitelco s local exchange revenues decreased by million and vitelco s interstate access charge revenues decreased by million for the year ended december  consolidated telephone operating expenses increased million for the year ended december  this increase was due principally to increased audiotext and outbound traffic expenses at gt t of million  due to increased traffic volume 
in addition  plant specific and plant non specific expenses increased as a result of increased plant in service  although certain expenses at vitelco were reduced in the fourth quarter of as vitelco s work force was shifted from maintenance activities to repairing the damage caused by hurricane marilyn overall  income from telephone operations increased million for the year ended december  the increase occurred principally because of increased audiotext traffic at gt t 
audiotext traffic increased million minutes and other gt t inbound paid and outcollect traffic increased million minutes for the year ended december  these revenue increases at gt t were partially offset by increased international long distance  plant  and other operating expenses 
this resulted in an increase in gt t s contribution to income from telephone operations of million for the year ended december  this was offset by an approximately million decrease in the contribution to income from telephone operations at vitelco caused by the impact of hurricane marilyn on vitelco s revenues and expenses discussed above 
gt t s audiotext traffic increased sharply in the first months of hitting a peak of million minutes for the month of august 
since then audiotext traffic has held relatively steady at about million minutes per month 
audiotext is a highly competitive business  and gt t may experience significant increases or decreases in the volume and profit margins of its audiotext traffic during income from continuing operations before minority interest increased million for the year ended december  the significant factors that contributed to this for the year ended december  were i the million increase in income from telephone operations discussed above  ii a million decrease in interest expense due to decreased rates and debt  iii a  increase in income from other operations  iv a million increase in income tax expense  principally due to higher taxable income 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the minority interest in earnings consists primarily of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
regulatory considerations upon the acquisition of gt t in january  gt t entered into an agreement with the government of guyana to expand significantly gt t s existing facilities and telecommunications operations and to improve service within a three year period pursuant to an expansion and service improvement plan the plan 
at gt t s request and with the consent of the government of guyana  the plan was modified in certain respects and the date for completion of the plan was extended first to august  and then to february  the government has referred to the puc the failure of gt t to complete the expansion plan by february  hearings on this subject before the puc were stayed by the guyana high court during however that stay has expired and the puc is free to schedule a hearing 
failure to timely fulfill the terms of the expansion plan could result in monetary penalties  cancellation of the license  or other action by the puc or the government which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and prospects 
in january  the puc ordered gt t to cease paying advisory fees to the company and to recover from the company approximately million of fees paid by gt t to the company since january gt t has filed a motion against the puc s order in the guyana high court and has obtained an order staying the puc s order pending determination of that motion 
at december   gt t owed the company approximately million for advances made from time to time for working capital and capital expenditure needs of gt t 
gt t s indebtedness to the company was evidenced by a series of promissory notes 
in march  the puc voided all of the promissory notes then outstanding for failure to comply with certain provisions of the puc law 
the puc ordered that no payments be made on any of the outstanding notes  and that gt t recover from atn all amounts theretofore paid 
the order also provided that the commission would be willing to authorize the payment for any amounts properly proven to the satisfaction of the puc to be due and payable from gt t to atn 
at the date of this report  gt t is planning to move against the puc s order in the guyana high court 
liquidity and capital resources the company depends upon funds received from subsidiaries to meet its capital needs  including servicing existing debt and its ongoing program of seeking to acquire telecommunications licenses and businesses 
the major source of funds for the company has been advisory fees received from gt t  which approximated million for the year ended december   and interest income from advances to its subsidiaries  which approximated million in these sources of funds  which provided net cash flows from operations after operating expenses and changes in working capital requirements of million  were used primarily to pay debt of the company 
the puc orders in january and march discussed above under regulatory considerations could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
other potential sources of funds to the company are from repayment of loans to subsidiaries or dividends from gt t or atn vi 
however  the rtfc loan limits the payment of dividends by atn vi unless atn vi meets certain financial ratios which were not met at december  
consequently atn vi was restricted from paying dividends at that date 
at december   the company also holds a note of atn vi in the amount of approximately million which may be repaid by atn vi in whole or in part without regard to the limit on the payment of dividends by atn vi 
atn vi s ability to service its debt is dependent on funds from its parent or its subsidiaries 
the rus loan and applicable rus regulations restrict vitelco s ability to pay dividends based upon certain net worth tests except for limited dividend payments authorized when specific security instrument criteria are unable to be met 
settlement agreements made in and with the us virgin islands public service commission psc also contain certain restrictions on dividends by vitelco which  in general  are more restrictive than those imposed by the rus 
dividends by vitelco are generally limited to of its net income  although additional amounts are permitted to be paid for the sole purpose of servicing atn vi s debt to the rtfc 
under the above restrictions  for the year ended december   vitelco dividend paying capacity was approximately  in excess of the amounts permitted for servicing atn vi debt 
the rtfc loan and rus loan agreements also require  among other things  maintenance of minimum debt service and times interest earned coverage and restrictions on issuance of additional long term debt 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its long term debt agreements 
vitelco estimates that the total cost of repairing damage to its telephone plant caused by hurricane marilyn was approximately million 
vitelco financed these expenditures from its cash balances which were million as of september   from cash flows from its operating activities  from million of borrowings under a preexisting line of credit with rtfc and an additional million of borrowings under a new million line of credit from rtfc which vitelco obtained after the hurricane 
vitelco has also received approval from the rus for million of long term financing 
borrowings under vitelco s preexisting line of credit are required to be repaid within months of the date of the borrowing  but may be repaid from the proceeds of borrowings under the new million line of credit 
borrowings under vitelco s million line of credit will mature on april   at which date  if long term loan funds from rus have not yet been made available to vitelco  vitelco will have the option of rolling the outstanding amount borrowed under that line of credit into a year term loan from rtfc having terms substantially similar to those contained in vitelco s existing long term loan from rtfc 
gt t is not subject to any contractual restrictions on payment of dividends 
however  the capital needs of gt t s expansion plan  the working capital required for gt t s rapid growth in audiotext traffic in and gt t s own debt service obligations have precluded gt t from paying any significant funds to the company other than the advisory fees mentioned above 
because the company pays fees owing to audiotext traffic providers on a more rapid schedule than it collects on its audiotext traffic  the company had to invest increasing amounts in the working capital related to its audiotext traffic during when this traffic was growing at a rapid rate 
the rate of growth in the required working capital for this traffic decreased shortly after august  when the volume of audio text traffic peaked and then leveled off 
as a result of the reduced need by gt t s audio text business for increasing amounts of working capital  gt t has been contributing significantly to the company s liquidity 
if and when the company settles outstanding issues with the guyana government and the puc with regard to gt t s expansion plan and its rates for service  gt t may require additional external financing to enable gt t to further expand its telecommunications facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing 
the company s short term bank credit facility  under which the company has million of loans outstanding  expired on october  the bank has orally agreed to renew this facility until october  and to waive the prohibition on borrowing under the facility during the first thirty days of the renewal period 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
a portion of gt t s taxes in guyana may be payable in us dollars or other hard currencies 
the company anticipates that gt t s foreign currency earnings will enable gt t to service its debt and pay its hard currency tax obligations 
there are no guyana legal restrictions on the conversion of guyana s currency into us dollars or on the expatriation of foreign currency from guyana 
impact of devaluation and inflation although the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars or other hard currencies  the results of operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in  however  the guyana dollar declined in value to the current rate of approximately to the us dollar  and it has remained relatively stable at approximately that rate since the effect of inflation on the company s financial results of telephone operations in the us virgin islands has not been significant in recent years 
the effect of inflation on the cost of providing telephone service in the us virgin islands has generally been offset without any increase in local subscribers rates by increased revenues resulting from growth in the number of subscribers and from regulatory cost recovery practices in determining access revenues
