in february  the company amended its bank agreements increasing its available line of credit to million which will be reduced to million on june  business trends west marine s growth in sales has been principally fueled by geographic expansion through acquisition  the opening of new stores and  to a lesser extent  by comparable store net sales increases 
although the company believes that the catalog and port supply divisions will continue to grow  future company net sales and profit growth  if any  will be increasingly dependent on the opening and profitability of new stores 
the company s catalog division has also faced market share erosion in markets where stores have been opened by either the company or competitors 
management expects this trend will continue 
in most of the company s product categories  prices have remained stable or have declined over the last three years  a trend which management expects is likely to continue 
as a result  sales increases during such periods have generally not been attributable to increases in prices 
in recent years  competition has increased which has adversely affected the company s gross profits 
these competitive and pricing pressures are likely to continue 
seasonality historically  the company s business has been highly seasonal 
as a result of the acquisition of e b marine  the company is even more susceptible to seasonality as a larger percentage of e b marine stores sales occur in the second and third quarters of the year 
during  of the company s net sales and an even higher percentage of its net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through july which represents the peak boating months in most of the company s markets 
in addition  the company will become even more susceptible to seasonality and weather as it continues to expand its operations in the northeast and midwest 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this filing or in documents incorporated by reference herein that relate to future plans  events  expectations  objectives or performance or assumptions underlying such matters are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
set forth below are certain important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
the company s growth has been fueled principally by the e b marine acquisition and the company s store operations 
if the company were to encounter unanticipated costs and difficulties related to the integration of the e b marine acquisition this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business  potential adverse short term effects on the company s operating results and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the company s continued growth depends to a significant degree on its ability to continue to expand its operations through the opening of new stores and to operate those stores profitably  as well as increasing sales at its existing stores 
the company s planned expansion is subject to a number of factors  including the adequacy of the company s capital resources and the company s ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms  to hire  train and integrate employees and to adapt its distribution and other operations systems 
the market for recreational boating supplies is highly competitive 
competitive pressures resulting from competitors pricing policies have adversely affected the company s gross profit and such pressures are expected to continue 
furthermore  the expected consolidation of the company s east coast distribution facilities could disrupt the company s business and adversely affect gross profits 
in addition  the company s operations could be adversely affected if unseasonably cold weather  prolonged winter conditions or extraordinary amounts of rainfall were to occur during the peak boating season in the second and third quarters 
additional factors which may affect the company s financial results include consumer spending on recreational boating supplies  environmental regulations  demand for and acceptance of the company s products and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the company s sec filings
