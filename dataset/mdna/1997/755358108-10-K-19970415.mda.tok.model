item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company has elected to focus its theater development and related real estate development activities in three principal areas i the management and development of motion picture theaters in australia  ii the domestic management and development and acquisition of specialty motion pictures theaters which feature foreign and limited release art films similar to the angelika  and iii the management and development of motion picture theaters in puerto rico 
to provide the company with equity to execute its theater acquisition and development plans  the company completed a private placement in late which included the reorganization and stock transactions as described below 
the reorganization and stock transactions the reorganization was effected in order to consolidate the company s operations under a holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
the company believes that such a structure will facilitate the financing of the company  without subjecting such capital to the contingent liabilities of the company s historical railroad business  and permit the company to avail itself of a more established body of corporate law than that of pennsylvania the state in which reading company is incorporated 
the stock transactions permitted the company to acquire assets which  in the opinion of management  could be converted into cash or utilized as collateral to raise cash funds necessary to finance the company s theater and real estate development activities 
pursuant to the stock transactions  the company received  of cash from citadel 
in return the company issued to citadel   in stated value  shares of the company s series a preferred stock and granted citadel certain contractual rights including the asset put option 
the asset put option grants citadel the right to require the company to acquire substantially all of citadel s assets and assume related liabilities in return for the issuance of common stock at any time through a date days after the company files its annual report on form k 
the number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the appraised value of the citadel assets or million  whichever amount is lower  by if citadel exercises the asset put option by october  and thereafter 
if the appraised value of citadel assets is in excess of million  the company will issue common stock at fair market value for such excess up to a total of million in citadel assets 
in addition  the company agreed to exchange the citadel preferred stock  which the company acquired from craig in the stock transactions  for citadel s series b preferred stock containing terms modified in certain respects from the terms of the citadel preferred stock 
the company received from craig the stater preferred stock with a stated value of  the citadel preferred stock with a stated value of  and craig s interest in reading international 
in return  rei issued to craig   shares of common stock and  shares  stated value of series b voting cumulative preferred stock the series b preferred stock 
certain financial reporting considerations the reorganization and stock transactions have been accounted for as a reorganization of related entities requiring that the company reflect the assets received at the lower of the value which they were recorded on the books of the affiliates  craig or citadel  or market 
the assets received were therefore recorded as follows cash  citadel preferred stock  stater bros 
preferred stock  ownership interest in reading international  gross book value of assets received  plus accrued and unpaid dividends the citadel preferred stock was redeemed by citadel in december the stock transactions are intended to qualify as an exchange under section a a exchange of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in a exchange  the party acquiring the assets in the stock transactions  rei retains the contributing parties tax basis in the acquired assets  with no taxable gain recognized as a result of the exchange 
the parties contributing assets in the stock transactions  craig and citadel obtain a basis in the assets received in the exchange equal to the basis in the assets which are contributed in the exchange the series a and series b preferred stock 
with the exception of the stater preferred stock  the book value of the assets received in the stock transactions approximated the tax basis in the assets received 
craig s adjusted tax basis for federal tax purposes in the stater preferred stock was approximately million 
the estimated tax liabilities associated with the assets received in the stock transactions were  in deferred federal income taxes primarily relating to the stater preferred stock 
at the time of the closing of the stock transactions  the company had a gross deferred federal tax asset of  and a tax asset valuation allowance the tava in the same amount 
upon receipt of the stater preferred stock  the company determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset which had previously been fully reserved  would be realized and the company reduced the tava by  which amount reflects the amount of federal tax loss carryforwards nols which were expected to be utilized net of  in alternative minimum tax amt 
a portion of the reversal of the tax asset valuation allowance   was included in income tax benefit in the company s consolidated statement of operations and was subsequently reclassified from retained earnings to other capital 
the balance   was credited directly to other capital in the company s consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
the amount which was included in income was equal to the nols which remained available to the company and which existed as of the date of the company s quasi reorganization 
at the time of the company s quasi reorganization  the company also realized a loss relating to the conveyance of certain assets to conrail and charged such loss directly to other capital 
the benefits of nols relating to such charge cannot be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
as of january   the company has no nols which existed at the time of the company s quasi reorganization and therefore  any future reductions in the company s tax valuation allowance will be reflected as income in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company issued common stock and the convertible preferred stock in exchange for assets received in the stock transactions 
the convertible preferred stock was reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the company at december  at its stated value per share  which value management believes approximates market 
the series a preferred stock has not been included as a component of shareholders equity since it includes provisions which permit a majority of the holders to request redemption at stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a day period beginning october  and also provides for redemption at the option of the majority of the holders  if the company fails to pay four quarterly dividends or in event of a change in control 
in addition to issuing to citadel the series a preferred stock  the company also granted the asset put option  which under certain circumstances permits citadel to exchange substantially all of its assets for common stock 
the company did not allocate any value to the asset put option due in part to the subjective nature of the assumptions utilized in option pricing models and the fact that stock option valuation models are intended to value transferable options and the asset put option is not transferable 
had a value been separately ascribed to the asset put option  the value of such option would have been deducted from the value of the series a preferred stock and included as other capital in the company s consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
in addition to the dividend payable on the million of convertible preferred stock  the company has elected to include as a component of preferred stock dividends in its calculation of earnings per common share  a provision which will total approximately  in for the amortization of the value of the asset put option based upon a valuation utilizing the black scholes option valuation model 
management believes that the tax gain related to the stater preferred stock recognized by the company was offset by the company s nol carryforwards see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
however  the amount of nols carried on the books of the company has not been audited by the internal revenue service the irs  and there can be no assurance that the irs would agree with the company as to the amount of nol available to offset such gains 
use of the nols is subject to certain limitations  including those resulting from certain changes in the ownership of the company 
while the transfer restrictions which are applicable to the company s equity securities are intended to minimize the risk of such ownership changes  ownership changes unknown to the company may have occurred despite or in violation of such restrictions 
in addition  the code and related case law limit the ability to use nols to offset certain built in gains on contributed its property 
although the company does not believe that such limitations on the use of its nols would apply to the disposition of the stater preferred stock  there can be no assurance that the irs would not take a different position 
also  if the irs were to determine that the principal purpose of the stock transactions was to make use of the nols and the company could not show otherwise  such use may not be available 
in such case  the financial position of the company could be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources reading australia s business plan provides for the development of country cinemas and entertainment centers see item i  business 
the country cinemas are smaller and more likely to be located in leased premises while the entertainment cinemas are generally free standing sites  many of which will include related retail developments which may be developed or sold as the company s theaters are developed 
it is intended that the entertainment centers be constructed on land owned by the company and  accordingly  such centers are capital intensive at this stage of development 
reading australia has signed three purchase agreements and a development agreement to acquire sites which will require the payment of approximately  if all of these projects are developed  reading australia estimates the total development cost of these four entertainment centers will aggregate in excess of  over the next two to three years 
to provide reading australia with funding needed to complete its theater development plans without requiring rei to guarantee the indebtedness of reading australia and as a means of minimizing the company s exposure to fluctuations in the value of the australian dollar and to demonstrate the company s commitment to the australian market  the company contributed its stater preferred stock to reading australia 
the company anticipates that reading australia will pledge the stater preferred stock as collateral for australian dollar borrowings and reading australia has had preliminary discussions in furtherance thereof 
in addition  the company has been advised that stater is considering exercising its right to repurchase the stater preferred stock and that such repurchase may occur as early as prior to the end of stater s fiscal year  september  if such repurchase were to occur  the repurchase would be at stated value   however  there can be no assurance that such repurchase can or will be effected 
the company s contribution of the stater preferred stock to reading australia resulted in a taxable gain for federal tax purposes of approximately  and resulted in an amt liability of  cine vista opened a new six plex on march  and will close four of six screens at another location in april in order to initiate construction of a new eight plex at the same location  which construction is anticipated to be completed in mid the company anticipates that it will invest approximately million in and in furtherance of these two projects 
cine vista is also negotiating provisions of an agreement to expand one facility and to open new theaters at two new sites which  collectively could result in the addition of up to new screens 
the timing of the additions is not predictable nor is the company assured of concluding these proposed developments 
the capital cost of these new additions is estimated to total approximately million 
cine vista may use funds available under its line of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein to fund its theater development activities 
the company recently announced the signing of a lease for the first new theater based upon the angelika concept to be located in houston  texas 
the company is actively seeking sites to develop angelika type theaters throughout the united states and will consider acquiring leasehold or ownership interests in conjunction with such developments 
the cash cost of such developments can range from approximately million for a turnkey leased facility to over million for an owned site 
if the company is successful in its efforts to develop all of the projects which it is presently considering  its capital requirements over the next three years will exceed its existing cash balances  the value of the stater preferred stock or the proceeds thereof and existing borrowing arrangements 
however  the company believes that additional funding could be realized through  among other things  bank borrowings  sale and lease back transactions and the issuance sale of additional equity either of rei  reading australia or at the project level

prior to the company s quasi reorganization  the company had extensive railroad and related operations 
such operations may have contributed to environmental contamination of properties now owned by the company  previously sold by the company  or to which the company  prior to its reorganization  sent waste 
the ultimate extent of liabilities  if any  with respect to such matters  as well as the timing of cash disbursements  if any  cannot be determined 
however  management is of the opinion  based on the information currently known  that while the ultimate liability resulting from such matters could have a material effect upon the results of operations in a given year  they will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position or liquidity 
results of operations due to the nature of the company s development and acquisition activities and the timing associated with the results of such activities  the effect of litigation awards and settlements  the third quarter acquisition of the angelika and the fourth quarter closing of the stock transactions  historical revenues and earnings have varied significantly and are not indicative of future operating results

theater revenues in included  in revenue inclusive of minority interest from the angelika for the period beginning august  the date that the company s interest in the angelika was acquired through the end of revenues from admissions at the angelika increased approximately from the admission revenues recorded by the angelika in the same period of the prior year such revenues which were recorded prior to the company s acquisition of the angelika are therefore not included the company s consolidated financial results

revenues from the new theater were not material in and have not been included in the consolidated financial results of the company in in  the company will receive the benefit of a full year of angelika theater revenues which totaled  in and the results of the company s theater in townsville  australia 
cine vista opened a new six plex in march and in mid will close four of six screens at another location to initiate construction of a new eight plex at the location which construction is anticipated to be completed in mid accordingly  cine vista anticipates a net increase of two screens in and the addition of six more screens in mid however  the increased competition in the san juan metropolitan market is expected to decrease theater revenues in  relative to levels  if overall box office revenues on the island remain equal to the prior year

interest and dividend income increased  in largely as a result of the company s acquisition of the stater preferred stock on october  in the stock transactions 
the stater preferred stock has a dividend yield of and contributed approximately  since its acquisition 
the increase in interest and dividend income associated with the stater preferred stock was offset somewhat by lower average investable fund levels due in part to the purchase of the angelika during the period prior to the closing of the stock transactions 
expenses theater costs  theater concession costs and depreciation and amortization reflect the direct theater costs of cine vista and the angelika s operations 
these costs inclusive of minority interest increased  from  in to  in due primarily to increased costs associated with higher revenues  the operating expenses associated with the addition of a new cine vista eight screen theater in late and the inclusion of  of theater costs associated with the angelika s operations subsequent to acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of  the minimum wage for puerto rico was increased by approximately 
since most of cine vista s theater employees are paid minimum wage  the increase will have a negative effect on its operating results in future periods 
general and administrative expenses for the years listed below include the following components cine vista  angelika australia  other  general    total    net of minority interest for applicable periods
