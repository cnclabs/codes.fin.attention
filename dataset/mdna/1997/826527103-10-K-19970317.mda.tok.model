net income for the year ended december  increased  from million during to million during this increase resulted from a increase in net interest income 
partially offsetting the increase in net interest income was a decline of in non interest income and an increase of in non interest expenses 
the following table summarizes the operating results for the years ended december    and amounts in thousands except percentage amounts december  over over amount percentage amount percentage total interest income      total interest expense      net interest income      provision for possible loan and lease losses   net interest income after provision for possible loan and lease losses

net interest income 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors such as the volume and distribu tion of interest earning assets  the rate charged on loans for interest and fees  the rate earned on investments and federal funds sold and the rate paid for deposits and other liabilities 
the following table sets forth in thousands  for the periods indicated  a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and from changes in rates 
income from tax exempt securities has not been presented on a tax equivalent basis as it is not significant 
for purposes of this table  the change not solely attributable to volume or rate has been allocated to change due to rate 
over over volume rate total volume rate total increase decrease in interest income loans       mutual funds taxable securities tax exempt securities federal funds sold other deposits total       increase decrease in interest expense deposits savings deposits transaction accounts time deposits      total      other borrowings convertible debentures total      increase in net interest income      as disclosed in the foregoing table  the company s net interest income in and increased over preceding years 
in both and volume increases were related to an increase in the asset size of the company 
during and  total daily average assets increased by and  respectively 
during these same periods  the volume component of the increase in net interest income was and  respectively 
during and  the rate of increase in the volume component of the increase in net interest income exceeded the increase in average daily assets  primarily as a result of an increase in the percentage of average interest earning assets to average total assets from in to during and in this increase in average interest earning assets was partially offset by a decrease in average non interest bearing deposits as a percentage of average total deposits from in to in and during during and in and  the company found itself in the position of funding much of its growth through the use of interest bearing deposits 
the company charges interest rates and fees in accordance with general economic conditions  capital and liquidity constraints  and desired net interest margin levels 
approximately of the company s loan portfolio consists of variable rate loans tied to the prime rate for leading west coast us banks 
the prime interest rate is influenced by forces outside the company s control 
because the company has less variable rate deposits than variable rate loans  the company would expect to incur a reduction in its net interest margin when interest rates fall  and when interest rates rise  the reverse would be expected to apply 
during the first quarter of the company moved to mitigate the effect of the change in the prime rate on its net interest income by entering into a three year million notional amount interest rate swap agreement with a major bank 
under this agreement the other bank pays a fixed rate of and receives from the company the prime rate 
if prime increases by  the company would pay the other bank thousand on an annual basis 
conversely  if prime decreases by  the other bank would pay the company thousand on an annual basis 
at the current prime rate of  the company will pay the other bank thousand annually 
any payments made or received by the company under the terms of the agreement are more than offset by the corresponding increase or decrease in interest on its variable rate loans 
this transaction has a similar effect to that of converting approximately of the company s variable rate loans to a fixed rate 
the average prime rate for leading banks and as used by the company prime rate for was compared to in this decrease equates to a negative price variance in of million compared to an actual negative price variance of million 
the difference includes a decrease in the contribution of loan fees 
as a percentage of average loans  loan fees represented in  in and in in addition to the decrease in prime and the decline in loan fees as a percentage of average loans  during the company has experienced increased competition in the pricing of its loans 
in  the average prime rate was compared to for this increase equated to a positive price variance in of million compared to an actual positive price variance of million 
the difference is primarily related to a decrease in the contribution of loan fees 
the positive volume variance in federal funds sold during resulted from the company s increase in liquid assets as its overall size increased 
during and continuing into the positive spread between short term us government securities and federal funds sold narrowed from levels and the company therefore increased its reliance on federal funds sold for short term investment purposes 
in addition  a higher level of federal funds sold was desired given the increase in loan funding levels 
the and rate variances in federal funds sold are primarily attributed to the interest rate changes during these periods 
the negative volume variance in includes the effect of the company s lowering its average investment in these funds while increasing its holdings of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
the company has kept its investment portfolio relatively short term in recent years  with the goal of focusing its attention on short term liquidity needs 
during and the company increased its holding of guaranteed portions of sba loans 
these loans  which can be sold in relatively short periods of time  provide an available source of additional liquidity 
during the company has decreased its reliance on short term us securities in funding its liquidity needs while increasing its holdings of longer term tax exempt securities 
these tax exempt securities provide an attractive investment alternative given the current interest rate environment and the increase in the average maturity of the investment portfolio is consistent with the additional sources of short term liquidity 
the positive rate variance during in taxable investment securities and tax exempt securities is primarily related to an increase in the average maturity of these portfolios  from a weighted average of years in to years in  excluding mortgage backed securities 
mutual funds consist of investments in mutual funds whose assets are invested primarily in us government securities 
mutual funds held during and related to a non money market mutual fund held principally for investment purposes 
the price variances for both and reflect the general changes in interest rates during these periods and additionally during includes the effect of the discontinuance of the use of money market mutual funds in the company s investment portfolio 
other assets consist primarily of the cash surrender value of officers life insurance policies 
interest earned on these policies is reduced by insurance costs incurred including  at the start of the second and third years for each policy  a surrender charge 
the modest volume increases in both and is due to retention of accrued interest in the policies 
because the company is now funding new employee participation with traditional pay as you go life insurance versus single premium life insurance  the volume increases in this asset will for the future be limited to retained income for existing single premium policies 
the rate variances in and are associated with market rate conditions 
the average balance and average rate paid on interest bearing transaction accounts during and are as follows year ended december  money money now market now market average balance     rate paid the rates paid on the company s deposits are primarily driven by market conditions in its service areas

in the average rate paid on time deposits declined to  but the rate paid on money market accounts increased 
the increase in money market rates includes the effect of tiering money market accounts at the company s nevada operations and general market conditions in the company s service area 
average interest bearing transaction accounts increased by million in during the company added four new branches located in carson city  nevada  and in sacramento  south grass valley and auburn  california

in addition  average time deposits held by public agencies increased by million 
out of area cd s totaled million at december  or of total deposits at that same date 
during the period the company s average time deposits increased by million or while its average money market accounts decreased by million or 
the company attributes the decrease in money market accounts both to a movement into higher interest rate time deposits and a movement into non bank money market accounts 
the increase in average time deposits during included both an increase in out of area cd s as well as retail cd s generated through the company s branch network 
out of area cd s at december  totaled million or of total deposits at this same date 
this represents an increase of million over the december  balance 
total cd s increased by million between december  and december  while average cd s increased by million during this same time period of which million represents out of area time deposits 
the rate variances in time deposits for and primarily relate to market conditions 
other borrowings consist primarily of federal funds purchased from other banks and a thousand capital lease related to the company s gateway branch 
the negative rate variance experienced during and includes the effect of capitalizing interest expense on the construction of branch facilities in reno and carson city  nevada 
the volume variance in convertible debentures in relates to the issuance of the bancorp s optional convertible debentures 
the negative rate and volume variances during in convertible debentures relate to the conversion into common stock of debentures having a principal balance of million

in evaluating the company s loan loss reserve  management considers the credit risk in the various categories in its portfolio 
historically  most of the company s loan losses have been in its commercial lending portfolio which includes sba loans and local commercial loans 
from inception of its sba lending program in  the company has sustained a relatively low level of losses from these loans  averaging less than of loans outstanding per year 
most of the company s non sba commercial loan losses have been for loans to businesses within the tahoe basin area and during and at the company s reno  nevada branch 
the company believes that it has taken steps to minimize its commercial loan losses  including centralization of lending approval and processing functions 
it is important for the company to maintain good relations with local business concerns and  to this end  it supports small local businesses with commercial loans 
to offset the added risk these loans may represent  the company typically charges a higher interest rate 
it also attempts to mitigate this risk through the loan review and approval process 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december  was million and net loan losses were thousand 
the provision in is primarily attributable to growth in the loan portfolio 
excluding the guaranteed portion of loans  loans increased million and million during and  respectively

the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at december  totaled million  which represented of loans and leases outstanding 
excluding loans and portions of loans guaranteed by the federal government  the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was at december  and at december  the following table sets forth the ratio of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans  the ratio of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to total loans and leases and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and leases as of the dates indicated

there were no non performing loans guaranteed by the federal government at december  excluding the guaranteed loans the allowance for possible loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans increases to at december  and at december  additionally  nonperforming loans to total loans and leases drops to at december  and at december  management considers the allowance of million at december   to be adequate as a reserve against foreseeable losses at that time 
total non interest income 
total non interest income for the year ended december  decreased by from the level 
for non interest income decreased by as compared to the following table summarizes the principal elements of total non interest income and discloses the increases decreases and percent of increases decreases for and amounts in thousands except percentage amounts increase decrease year ended december  over over amount percentage amount percentage service charges    securities losses gains  net gain on sale of loans   net loan servicing income    other income   service charges on deposit accounts increased by in over levels and declined in as compared to levels

in the company altered its strategy with respect to the sale of sba a loans 
rather than continuing to sell the guaranteed portion of the portfolio the company began to retain the guaranteed portion and plans to securitize and sell portions of unguaranteed sba loans 
the company estimates that the decline in sales between and would have been reduced by up to million if it had continued to sell the guaranteed portion of loans available for sale in  resulting in an estimated decline in sales of approximately million 
this decline includes the effect of temporary restrictions in the sba program which were in place during most of these temporary restrictions reduced the maximum loan that could be made under the sba a program and in most cases eliminated guarantees for refinanced debt 
at december  the company had million of guaranteed portions of sba loans  which it could sell  an increase of million over the million held at december  sba loan sales during primarily relate to loans to the hotel motel industry 
by selling these guaranteed portions the company is able to take advantage of new lending opportunities in this industry while maintaining an acceptable level of loans to this industry in its portfolio 
the decline in sba loan production in as compared to and earlier years includes the effect of increased competition in the sba market place  a temporary shortage of qualified sba underwriters and a reduction in the dollar volume of loans referred by sba loan packagers 
to support its sba program the company has  since  relied in part on third party sba loan packagers 
in  approximately of the company s sba loans were generated by sba packagers 
this compares to during the packagers refer proposed sba loans to the company and provide certain services to the borrowers 
the packagers receive fees of a fixed amount from the borrowers  not exceeding limits prescribed by the sba  for preparing the sba loan application for the borrower

during the company expects to open a new loan production office in denver  colorado 
the company experienced disappointing results at its buena park facility and closed it during in lieu of providing a full office  the company contracted with an established loan broker to provide sba loan referrals from the southern california market 
the contract gives the company an exclusive right of first refusal on all a loans referred by this broker 
to date  loans referred through this source have not been significant 
in addition  the company has increased its efforts to diversify its lending activities and during and has experienced significant gains in its construction  real estate and non sba commercial loan portfolios 
net loan servicing income decreased by in as compared to this compares to an increase of in over net loan servicing income primarily consists of net servicing income on sba loans 
for the years ended december   and  net servicing income on sba loans totaled million  million and million  respectively 
servicing income on sba loans is reported net of the amortization of the excess servicing recorded on the sale of the same loans and the amortization of purchased servicing 
amortization is based on the expected average life of the related loans 
to date  actual prepayment experience reflects an average life in excess of the estimated life 
the increase in net servicing income on sba loans in is primarily attributable to a change made by the company during the third quarter of related to its estimates of the prepayment speeds of the sba loans it services

the increase in sba loans relates primarily to the company s decision to retain the guaranteed portion of sba loans and additionally to an increase in lending directed towards the sba s program

these deposits  which at december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively  represented  and of total deposits as of december   and  respectively 
to attract out of area cds  sierrawest bank subscribes to a listing service which lists nationally the rate the bank is prepared to pay 
customers call sierrawest bank directly and place deposits 
additionally  beginning in sierrawest bank began accepting referrals by brokers which can result in a slightly lower cost of those deposits 
at december  million of out of area cd s have been acquired through broker referrals 
to attract deposits  sierrawest bank pays a market rate which may at times be above the comparable rate offered by sierrawest bank to its local depositors 
the overhead costs associated with these out of area deposits is  however  lower than that for local deposits since local deposits require the use of bank branch facilities and hence the company believes the cost of these funds does not normally exceed the cost sierrawest bank incurs to generate comparable deposits through its branch system 
while out of area deposits are acquired at an acceptable cost  sierrawest bank monitors the level of these deposits because it is concerned that out of area deposits are more rate sensitive and volatile and that there may be some exposure for increased costs in the future should the supply tighten 
if interest rates rise rapidly  the company s reliance on these deposits could have an adverse impact on net interest income if the costs to retain those deposits rise faster than rates charged on interest earning assets

the buena park office was closed in see page herein 
the company plans to finance its expansion program through the retention of internally generated earnings  through the use of the proceeds of its million debt offering completed in february  and through the possible future issue of equity and or further debt offerings 
factors which could impede the company s growth strategy include possible non approval by the banking regulators of applications for acquisitions or new branches  and the possible inability of bancorp to raise future capital through the issuance of equity or debt
