item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in to develop and commercialize advanced rechargeable batteries based on lithium and polymer technologies 
since its inception  the company has been a development stage company primarily engaged in acquiring and developing its initial technology  manufacturing limited quantities of prototype batteries  recruiting personnel  and acquiring capital 
to date  other than insubstantial revenues from limited sales of prototype batteries  the company has not received any significant revenues from the sale of products 
substantially all revenues to date have been derived from a research and development contract with the delphi automotive systems group of general motors corporation delphi formerly delco remy division 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of  from its inception to march  in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in the section entitled business 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the five year summary of selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
all references to years represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
results of operations fiscal years ended march  fiscal  march  fiscal and march  fiscal during fiscal  the company continued development activities under a research and development agreement with delphi 
that phase of a multi year agreement  which provided for the aggregate funding of up to  was completed during the quarter ending september  payments were generally made in accordance with the achievement of certain milestones 
no revenues were recognized during fiscal and fiscal revenues of  were recognized during fiscal regarding the completed delphi agreement 
in september   the company and delphi signed a new five year agreement to combine efforts in developing the company s rechargeable solid state lithium polymer battery technology 
under the agreement  delphi and the company combined their research and development activities in a new facility in henderson  nevada 
the new facility is owned by the company  with delphi paying a fee of  per month over the five year term of the new agreement for access to the company s research and development of which  was recognized during fiscal as an offset to research and product development expenses 
in addition  delphi is paying a majority of the facility s operating costs over the term of the new five year agreement 
the company is treating both of these payments as an offset to expenses 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company announced its intent to refocus its efforts on research and product development and to slowdown completion of its volume manufacturing capacities 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company also announced its intent to reduce its efforts related to commercialization of a battery containing a lithium metal anode and instead concentrate on the development of a lithium polymer battery containing an alternate lithium anode 
the company produced significant cost savings as a result of these activities 
research and product development expenses were   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal versus fiscal reflects the company s increased efforts to commercialize a product in fiscal or as soon thereafter as practicable 
the decrease between fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to cost sharing with delphi  reductions in personnel and related costs concurrent with the company s decision to slow completion of its volume manufacturing capacities and refocus on other aspects of research and product development 
marketing expenses were   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the comparative decrease from fiscal and to is the result of a decrease in payroll  travel and relocation expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and is comparable to the  spent in fiscal fiscal increase over fiscal was due to increased legal costs associated with the shareholder class action lawsuit 
the fiscal to decrease reflects a reduction in spending consistent with the research and development redirection as well as cost sharing with delphi 
associated with the fiscal refocus on research and development  special charges in fiscal were  per share for which no tax benefit is currently available 
such charges were made primarily to write down equipment the company had acquired  or is contractually committed to acquire  and which was originally intended for use in manufacturing batteries utilizing a lithium metal anode 
an additional component of the special charges was for facilities consolidation costs 
during fiscal  the company incurred a one time charge to operations of  per share for the write off of in process technology related to the technology transfer agreement with bellcore 
technological feasibility of the in process technology acquired had not been established and there was no alternate future use 
interest income was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of lower interest rates and fewer funds available for investment during fiscal due to ongoing losses 
interest expense decreased to  from  and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of a reduction in long term debt associated with capital equipment leases 
the increase in fiscal versus fiscal is the result of additional long term debt acquired in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company used  net cash for operating activities during fiscal  whereas it used  during fiscal and  during fiscal  a decrease between fiscal and fiscal of  this net decrease primarily resulted from a reduction in losses and the write off of the bellcore technology acquisition 
net cash used in fiscal decreased by  from fiscal as the result of special charges in fiscal partially offset by acquisition of the bellcore technology in fiscal during fiscal  the company provided  net cash from investing activities compared to a net provision of  during fiscal  and  provided during fiscal  a decrease of  between fiscal and the decrease was a result of lower losses and shortening of maturities to support fiscal capital expenditure budgets 
there were  net maturities during fiscal  as compared to  net maturities during fiscal in addition  capital expenditures increased  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal the company used  in fiscal as compared to  net cash from financing activities during fiscal  versus providing  during fiscal this decrease resulted from reductions in long term debt 
in fiscal the company provided funds by increasing its long term borrowings by  as a result of the above  the company had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of  during fiscal and  during fiscal  whereas it had a net decrease of  during fiscal the company s  working capital line of credit is available through march  the working capital line collateralizes outstanding letters of credit  which reduce borrowings otherwise available under the line 
as of march   there was one outstanding letter of credit in the amount of during fiscal  the company  through its dutch subsidiary  signed an agreement with the northern ireland industrial development board the idb to open an automated manufacturing plant in northern ireland in exchange for capital and revenue grants from the idb 
the company has also received offers from the idb to receive additional grants 
the grants available under the agreement and offers  for an aggregate of up to l  generally become available over a five year period through october  as of march   the company had received grants aggregating l  reducing remaining grants available to l  us  as of march  as a condition to receiving funding from the idb  the subsidiary must maintain a minimum of l  in debt or equity financing from the company 
aggregate funding under the grants is limited to l  until the company has recognized  in aggregate revenue from the sale of its batteries produced in northern ireland 
given that the company has no agreements to supply batteries using its current technology  there are no assurances that the company will be able to meet the agreement s revenue test 
the amount of the grants available under the agreement and offers is primarily dependent on the level of capital expenditures made by the company 
substantially all of the funding received under the grants is repayable to the idb if the subsidiary is in default under the agreement and offers  which includes the permanent cessation of business in northern ireland 
funding received under the grants to offset capital expenditures is repayable if related equipment is sold  transferred or otherwise disposed of during a four year period after the date of grant 
in addition  a portion of funding received under the grants may also be repayable if the subsidiary fails to maintain specified employment levels for the two year period immediately after the end of the five year grant period 
the company has guaranteed the subsidiary s obligations to the idb under the agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet the requirements necessary for it to receive and retain grants under the idb agreement and offers 
the company expects that its existing funds as of march   together with the interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations through calendar the company anticipates that it may need substantial additional funds in the future possibly as early as the third or fourth quarter of fiscal for capital expenditures  research and product development  marketing and general and administrative expenses and to pursue joint venture opportunities 
the company s cash requirements  however  may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in the company s operations  including changes in oem relationships or market conditions 
there can be no assurance that funds for these purposes  whether from equity or debt financing agreements with strategic partners or other sources  will be available on favorable terms  if at all
