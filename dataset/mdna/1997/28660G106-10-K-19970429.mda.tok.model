item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the shoe manufacturing and importing operations of the company were permanently discontinued in the first quarter of  and the operations of the company following the merger which was consummated on november   consist solely of the fragrance operations of ffi  which was the accounting acquiror in the merger 
therefore  the following discussion and analysis relates to the results of operation of ffi until the merger and the financial condition and results of operation of the company following the merger 
the company s business is the manufacturing  distribution and marketing of prestige fragrances and related cosmetic products 
the company distributes and markets on an exclusive basis in the united states to both department stores and mass market retailers the controlled brands  including  the geoffrey beene brands of grey flannel  eau de grey flannel and bowling green  the halston brands of halston  catalyst  z and  and the brands colors of benetton  tribu  ombre rose  ombre d or  ombre bleue  faconnable  balenciaga  talisman  rumba  le dix  lapidus  creation  fantasme  bogart  witness  one man show  chevignon and niki de saint phalle  as well as the galenic elancyl skin care products 
in the case of the halston and geoffrey beene fragrance brands  the company also controls the manufacturing and exclusive worldwide distribution of such brands 
in addition to the controlled brand operations  the company also distributes  primarily to mass market retailers  distributed brands it obtains from manufacturers and other sources 
the company also has a ownership interest in fine fragrances which distributes on an exclusive basis in the united states and canada fragrances manufactured by cofci  including the salvador dali  salvador  laguna  dalissime  dalimix  cafe  taxi and watt brands 
the company accounts for its investment in fine fragrances under the equity method of accounting  whereby its initial investment is recorded at cost  adjusted by its share of the fine fragrances operating results and reduced by distributions received 
if  as management expects  the company exercises the fine option  fine fragrances will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and the company will account for the operations of fine fragrances on a consolidated basis 
see item business licensing and exclusive distribution agreements  fine fragrances option cofci 
the controlled brand operations have somewhat different financial characteristics than the distributed brand operations 
as a percentage of net sales  the controlled brand operations tend to have higher gross margins  as well as higher marketing and selling  general and administrative expenses  than the distributed brand operations 
the higher gross margins have been greater than the higher marketing and selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the controlled brand operations 
the acquisition of the licenses and trademarks associated with the controlled brand operations also increases amortization expense 
overall  brand contribution margin operating income after amortization of acquisition costs and amortization of exclusive brand licenses  as a percentage of net sales of controlled brands is greater than that of distributed brands

ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income loss or net income loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of the company s operating performance or to net cash provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of its ability to meet cash needs 
the company believes that ebitda is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties in the fragrance industry as a measure of a fragrance company s operating performance and debt servicing ability because it assists in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization  which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods particularly when acquisitions are involved or nonoperating factors such as historical cost 
accordingly  this information has been disclosed herein to permit a more complete comparative analysis of the company s operating performance relative to other companies in the fragrance industry and of the company s debt servicing ability 
however  ebitda may not be comparable in all instances to other similar types of measures used in the fragrance industry

for example  in fiscal  of the company s net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from its customers  sales and results of operations can vary significantly between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  the company expects to experience variability in net sales and net income on a quarterly basis 
the company s working capital borrowings are also seasonal  and are normally highest in the months of september and october 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ending january  significant cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday orders are received

during the fiscal year ended january   the company received approximately million of net cash from financing activities  primarily to fund the geoffrey beene acquisition 
the company financed this transaction through the issuance of subordinated debentures and a term note under the existing credit facility 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company and ffi prior to the merger has historically financed  and expects to continue to finance  its internal growth and acquisitions primarily through its credit facility  external financing and internally generated funds 
the company s principal future uses of funds are for working capital requirements  debt service and additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements 
as a result of the halston acquisition and the fmg acquisition  the growth in direct distribution relationships for additional fragrance brands and certain favorable buying opportunities  the company s working capital needs have increased significantly and are expected to continue to increase 
management of the company believes that internally generated funds and other available financing under the company s credit facility will be sufficient to cover the company s working capital and debt service requirements other than any additional working capital requirements which may result from further expansion  through acquisitions of brands or new product distribution arrangements  of the company s operations for at least the next months 
in an effort to refinance indebtedness including the indebtedness under its existing credit facility and approximately million principal amount of subordinated debentures  to provide additional working capital support and to provide increased operational and financial flexibility to take advantage of expansion opportunities  through acquisitions of brands or new product distribution arrangements  the company has commenced a private placement of approximately million in senior notes due the notes 
the offering of the notes the offering is expected to close by the middle of may the notes will not be registered under the securities act of  as amended and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements 
there is no assurance that the terms of the offering will be acceptable to the company or that the company will be able to consummate the offering 
if the offering is consummated  the company expects to enter into a new standby credit facility to be available for additional working capital support  but substantially all other new indebtedness will be conditioned on the company satisfying certain fixed charge coverage ratios 
if the offering is not consummated  the company will retain its existing credit facility 
the company s future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon its relative amounts of current assets principally cash  accounts receivable and inventories and current liabilities principally short term debt  accrued expenses and accounts payable 
additional inventory requirements and accounts receivable can have a significant impact on the company s liquidity  particularly during expansion 
to date  the company generally has not experienced any material adverse problems with the collection of accounts receivable relating to its fragrance operations 
a portion of the company s accounts receivable relating to its fragrance operations is insured by a third party to cover the risk of uncollectibility 
however  there can be no assurance that refusals to pay or delays in payment would not have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  results of operations and general financial condition in the future 
in addition  as a result of increased sales to department stores of products subject to return rights  the company expects that it may incur higher levels of returns 
the company establishes reserves and provides allowances for returns at the time of sale  but there can be no assurance that such reserves and allowances will be adequate 
further expansion of the company s operations  including through additional brand acquisitions or the acquisition of exclusive distribution rights to additional fragrance brands  will require increased investment in accounts receivable and inventories  which may negatively impact the company s cash flow from operations 
the company has discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with other wholesalers that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding possible acquisitions by the company of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
the company currently has no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although it periodically executes routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with such persons 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that it will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of its operations

all borrowings under the new credit facility would mature and be due and payable on may  the company s borrowings under the new credit facility would be secured by a first priority lien on all of the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
loans under the revolving portion of the new credit facility would bear interest at floating rates ranging from  at the option of the company  either i over libor to over libor or ii the prime rate quoted by fleet to over such prime rate  and combinations thereof  in each case depending upon the company s funded debt to equity ratio as calculated pursuant to the terms of the new credit facility

the series i debentures and series ii debentures require aggregate mandatory annual principal payments of approximately million commencing january   with the final payment due january  the company also has outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the convertible debentures are convertible at any time at per share the conversion price into shares of common stock  and are redeemable at par at any time commencing july  at the option of the company  but only in the event the common stock  at the time a redemption notice is delivered by the company  has been trading at no less than for consecutive trading days 
the convertible debentures are due june  and require interest only payments payable semi annually until maturity at which time the entire unpaid principal amount and any unpaid accrued interest is due and payable 
in connection with the fmg acquisition  the company issued approximately million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures the debentures 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the debentures consist of a million debenture which requires mandatory principal payments of million in may and  and three additional debentures in the aggregate principal amount of million which requires mandatory annual principal repayments in the aggregate amount of million commencing may  with the remaining balance due may the characteristics of the company s business do not generally require it to make significant ongoing capital expenditures

see item properties 
in connection with the renovation of the miami lakes facility  the company expects to incur renovation costs estimated at million for the fiscal year ended january  approximately million of these amounts will be funded from escrowed funds held by the mortgage company from the mortgage on the miami lakes facility 
following the renovation of the miami lakes facility  the company anticipates that its annual capital expenditures will be less than million for the foreseeable future

pending completion of the renovation of the miami lakes facility  the company is continuing to occupy the national trading facility as its executive offices 
subsequent to relocation of the executive offices  the company and national trading will pursue a potential sale or lease of the national trading facility to a third party that would discharge the company from the lease obligation 
there is no assurance that any such sale or lease will be consummated 
impact of inflation and foreign exchange fluctuations the company believes that although inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations  inflation would likely increase the interest rates that the company pays on its floating rate indebtedness 
although large fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a material effect on the prices the company pays for certain products it purchases from outside of the united states  the prices obtainable for sales denominated in foreign currencies and wholesale sales to foreign customers  such fluctuations have not been material to the company s results of operations to date
