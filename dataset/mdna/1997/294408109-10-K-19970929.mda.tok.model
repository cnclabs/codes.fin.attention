item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of operations and financial condition of equalnet should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements on page overview the company s long distance volume was more than million monthly minutes in june substantially all of the company s revenues have been derived from the sale of long distance services to small business customers 
the source of these accounts is primarily the company s network of independent marketing agents and the acquisition of customer accounts of other resellers 
many of these agents actively market the company s long distance products via telemarketing 
the company s primary costs  its costs of sales  are variable and consist of the underlying wholesale cost of long distance services from its underlying providers  commissions to independent agents and billing costs 
however  in the opinion of the company  to the extent that the company is able to continue to negotiate more favorable rates from its providers  additional savings may be achieved in the company s costs  particularly the costs of long distance service 
additionally  with the completion of the company s internal customer billing system  the company believes it will see a reduction in the current cost of billing as a percentage of revenues as well 
the company has generated revenue through orders received from independent marketing agents and by acquiring the customer accounts of several other resellers 
the company acquires customer accounts from certain of its independent marketing agents on an individual price per order basis  with some agents receiving an initial payment to help defer the cost of acquiring the orders which will be offset by future commissions earned agent advances and others receiving a higher initial payment with no future commission owed deferred acquisition costs 
this allows the company to use the agents as a vehicle to outsource telemarketing activities 
expenditures associated with individually acquired orders  both advanced and purchased  totaled approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company expects that future revenue growth will come primarily from the development of independent marketing agents and additional acquisitions of customer accounts or businesses 
the company s selling  general and administrative costs are primarily the costs of back office operations and customer service 
the company also has devoted significant resources to the development of the information technology necessary to support customer service and the network of independent marketing agents 
netbase is a proprietary software system designed to provide efficient order provisioning and access to customer account information 
the company s operations and customer service efforts depend on netbase  which serves as the interface between the company and its independent marketing agents 
the company plans to continue to develop and enhance this system 
the company reported for federal income tax purposes as an s corporation under the internal revenue code of  as amended  until its reorganization in connection with its initial public offering in march  and was similarly treated for state income tax purposes under comparable state laws 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated the percentages of total sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income and expenses percentage of total revenues fiscal year ended june  total sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization write down of long term assets operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense miscellaneous income loss before federal income taxes and extraordinary item provision benefit for federal income taxes net income loss year ended june   compared to year ended june  total sales 
long distance sales decreased  from million in fiscal to million for the year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the number of customer accounts and a corresponding decrease in billable minutes 
the decline in revenues in fiscal year was the result of an increased rate of attrition on existing customers and a decline in order activity beginning in the last half of fiscal year the company began reducing order activity in early calendar to reduce the incidence of loss due to delayed provisioning times at at t and because it discovered a new customer management system was severely hampering the company s ability to provision and service new customers 
the company slowly began increasing order activity once it had reverted to the original netbase system and provisioning times had returned to acceptable levels  however  the company began experiencing liquidity problems during this time frame and has been unable to fund agent advances that stimulate order activity as significant as those experienced prior to january total cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales  which are variable  decreased from million in fiscal to million for the year ended june   a decrease of 
this decrease was a result of a decrease in the company s sales 
the company s cost of long distance which is a component of cost of sales improved as a percentage of sales  decreasing from to for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the improvement in the percentage is the result of the renegotiation of the company s contracts with its carriers and from the recognition of a one time credit from at t 
the company negotiated an improvement in the interstate rate it receives from at t in may followed by an improvement again in november and another improvement in may additionally  the company was granted a one time credit of million as part of the new contract with at t  effective may  and a  backlog of carrier disputes being processed by the company and credited by the company s carriers in march the carrier dispute backlog was the result of difficulties at t encountered in processing the company s disputed long distance usage which had cumulated over an extended period of time 
commission expense as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
commission expense included a million charge and  charge for fiscal years and  respectively  to expense advances to agents that are not expected to be recovered through future commissions earned by those agents 
commissions as a percentage of revenues without these charges would be and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease relates in part to a payment in the second quarter of fiscal to a principal agent to reduce the agent s commission rate by approximately 
of the company s total sales during fiscal years and  and  respectively  were derived from customers introduced to the company from this agent 
the company shifted its sales strategy from that of purchasing customer accounts and bases of customer accounts  which have very little associated commission expense  to one of advancing commissions to independent marketing agents for individual customer accounts 
accordingly  the company expects commission expense as a percent of revenue to increase moderately in future periods as a result of the increased emphasis in obtaining orders utilizing agents with residual commissions on those orders 
this increase in commission expense will be offset by a decrease in amortization expense of purchased accounts 
billing expense as a percentage of sales increased from to for the fiscal years ending and  respectively  as a result of the company beginning to bill a significant portion of its customers through local exchange carriers lecs 
billings through the lecs represented of the company s revenues for the year ended june  the cost of billing through lecs is generally greater than billing customers through independent billing companies  however  the company believes that by billing customers through the lecs  savings will also be recognized by decreased bad debt expense and reduced customer attrition 
in addition  because the majority of customer service is performed by the lecs  the company has been able to reduce overhead related to the cost of servicing these customers directly 
bad debt expense decreased from of sales in fiscal year to of sales in fiscal year the company s collection efforts were hindered in fiscal by the failure of a new customer management system to produce the necessary information to allow for the most effective method of collection  resulting in a higher than normal incident of uncollected accounts 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the same period in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from to for the years ended june  and  respectively

salary related expense decreased million from fiscal to fiscal as a result of the decrease in personnel 
administrative expense was down  for fiscal compared to fiscal as the result of decreasing supplies and office expense by  and due to a reduction in long distance and telephone related expenses by  the decrease in long distance and phone related expenses was related to the acquisition of a new telephone system in january which allowed the company to significantly reduce hold times  thereby reducing long distance costs  and due to the decrease in the number of customers  resulting in fewer calls 
additionally  the company incurred  in acquisition related costs in early fiscal which were not present in fiscal these savings were offset somewhat by an increase in professional fees  bank fees  marketing fees  lease expense and the addition of creative and its related overhead 
the company incurred approximately  in additional legal and professional fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal included in professional fees are fees paid to third party verification companies which the company utilized to verify customer orders 
these fees totaled approximately  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal bank fees increased as a result of the cost of obtaining an amendment to the company s loan agreement while marketing fees increased as the company conducted an aggressive campaign related to the placement of long distance calling cards with all of its customers 
lease expense increased  from fiscal to fiscal the company entered into two significant leases in january for a new telephone system and for computer equipment to support the company s information system network

the write down of deferred acquisition costs was necessitated by a greater than expected turnover of acquired customer bases which resulted from difficulties in billing and servicing the underlying customer accounts 
operating loss 
the operating loss increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  other income expense 
other expense increased from million for fiscal to million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase in miscellaneous expense of  the increase in interest expense was the result of the increase in the interest rate under the company s bank line of credit and the addition of the note payable to furst 
miscellaneous expense in fiscal includes a  accrual for possible penalties  settlement costs and legal expenses associated with the resolution of pending complaints against the company by various state regulatory agencies with regard to customer complaints

this increase was a result of an increase in the company s sales 
the company s cost of long distance which is a component of cost of sales remained relatively stable as a percentage of sales  decreasing slightly from to for the years ended june  and  respectively 
commission expense as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
this decrease in commissions was the result of a change in the company s sales strategy from that of advancing commissions to independent marketing agents for individual customer accounts  to one of purchasing customer accounts and bases of customer accounts 
the purchased bases and accounts have no associated commission expense

of the company s total sales during fiscal years and  and  respectively  were derived from customers introduced to the company from this agent 
billing expense as a percentage of sales increased from to  a result of the average monthly customer bill decreasing from per month to per month and the increase in the number of delinquent accounts 
bad debt expense increased from of sales in fiscal year to of sales in fiscal year a primary factor to the increase in bad debt expense incurred by the company was the result of the shift to more purchased orders for which the company had full exposure to uncollectible accounts as compared to commissioned orders for which the agents shared in a substantial portion of the risk on uncollectible accounts 
in addition  the company s collection efforts were hindered by the failure of netbase plus to produce the necessary information to allow for the most timely and effective method of collection 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the same period in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from to for the years ended june  and  respectively

the company incurred approximately  in additional legal  accounting and professional fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the added cost of being a public company for all of fiscal  the significant level of attempted acquisition activity in the first half of fiscal  the joint venture with metrolink  inc metrolink  and the renegotiation of the company s loan agreement with its principal lender in november and amendments to that agreement in march and june depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the same period for the year ended june  amortization expense has increase substantially because of the purchase of a customer base in june for million and the investment of million in fiscal in individual orders purchased from independent marketing agents 
depreciation expense has risen over the same periods as a result of the significant investment in computers needed to support the company s growth and as a result of the investment in netbase plus 
the company wrote down assets during the year ended june   of approximately million 
included in the write down were a million non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of acquired customer bases to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the underlying customer accounts and a million write off of capitalized software development costs associated with the netbase plus system 
the write down of deferred acquisition costs was necessitated by continued greater than expected turnover of acquired customer bases which resulted from difficulties in billing and servicing the underlying customer accounts 
during fiscal  the company reverted from the netbase plus operating system which was implemented in november  to the company s original netbase operating system 
the company determined that the netbase plus system had inherent design flaws which resulted in inefficient operation and abandoned the entire system in april the company expects the reversion to the original netbase to reduce cash outlays that were required to service  maintain and modify the netbase plus system  as well as decrease depreciation expense in the future by approximately  per month 
operating income loss 
operating income decreased from million for the year ended june   to an operating loss of million for fiscal other income expense

the company funded its operations during the year ended june  through extension of payment terms from the companys major suppliers  advances under its revolving credit facility  from a million debt offering and through operating cash flows 
due to operating losses sustained in the second half of fiscal and throughout fiscal and a declining revenue base  the company reached its maximum borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility 
the company s borrowing capacity under this credit facility continued to decline as a result of operating losses  a decline in the revenue base and the exclusion of certain receivables from the criteria of eligible receivables 
an additional source of liquidity during this time period has been an extension of payment terms from the company s major suppliers  although there can be no assurance that any such extensions will be granted in the future 
at current levels of operations and with a declining borrowing base  the company must seek additional capital and continued concessions from its vendors and must continue to reduce expenses to bring them in line with current levels of revenues 
cash flow from operations 
the company generated net cash of  and  in operating activities in fiscal and  respectively 
cash from net losses adjusted for non cash expenses decreased from a source of million in fiscal year to a use of cash of million in this use in fiscal was offset by the change in operating assets and liabilities  including a million change in accounts receivable  a million change in accounts payable and a million change in prepaid expenses and other 
accounts receivable decreased as revenues continued their decline throughout fiscal and due to continued improvement in collection activities by the company 
accounts payable  particularly the payable to providers of long distance  increased as a result of the extended payment terms negotiated by the company 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other was primarily the receipt of a million federal tax refund during fiscal offsetting these sources was the use of cash for advances paid to agents for orders  resulting in the increase in the amounts due from agents  and for the change in other assets   of which were advances to uns 
the company is involved in negotiations with the attorneys general for eleven states concerning alleged consumer protection violations in the marketing of long distance service by the company s independent contractor sales agents in those states

see item legtal proceedings 
cash flow from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly from million in fiscal to  in fiscal during fiscal year the company purchased million of customer accounts 
the company expended million for computer equipment and related software development in because of the liquidity concerns the company experienced during fiscal the company consciously restricted investing activities 
the company invested  in property  plant and equipment   of which was for the completion of the in house billing system which was placed into service in february in addition  the company reverted from its policy of buying orders from its agents to a strategy of advancing commissions which  if the advances are recovered by the company  will provide the agents with a continuing revenue stream 
as such  the company expended only  on purchased orders during fiscal financing activities 
financing activities provided million to the company in fiscal year and used million in fiscal the company increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility during fiscal  resulting in net proceeds of million 
however  in fiscal due to increased restrictions imposed upon the company by its primary lender and due to the declining revenue base  the company experienced a decline in the borrowing base available under the line of credit 
this resulted in a net reduction in borrowings under the line in fiscal of million 
the company sought to offset a portion of the loss of funds under the line of credit and issued subordinated debt in february which resulted in million in proceeds 
working capital and long cash cycle 
customer billings for long distance services are generated from detailed call records which are generally available from the carrier on or about the tenth day of the month following the month of customer usage 
customer invoices usually are generated within ten days thereafter and are due by the th day following the month of customer usage 
however  the company historically collects a large portion of receivables after the scheduled due date  resulting in an average cash cycle of approximately days 
since the company s underlying carriers historically have been paid within days following the month of usage  delays in receipt of customer payments have resulted in significant working capital needs 
the company has currently negotiated extended payment terms with its primary underlying carrier which extend payment terms on newly generated costs in excess of days 
in addition  the company has negotiated terms with its current carriers on past due obligations which allow the company to satisfy the obligations over the next four to eight months 
failure to comply with the negotiated terms could result in the acceleration of the demand for payment and  in the extreme  could result in the termination of the company s underlying service 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to obtain concessions from its carriers 
should the company be unable to meet the currently agreed to terms or  should the company be unable to continue to negotiate favorable terms  it would be required to fund the obligations through its operating cash flow  funds available under its borrowing arrangement  third party sources of capital and working capital 
if required at this time  such funds would not be available to satisfy the obligations when due and the carrier could terminate the company s underlying service 
sales taxes 
in early  the company determined that its treatment and disbursement of sales taxes was not being properly administered and engaged an outside tax compliance firm to assist in the resolution of the matter with the various states and other regulatory and taxing authorities at june   the company has accrued  for resolution of this matter 
the improper treatment of sales taxes arose from the company s failure to remit the sales tax due to various taxing authorities on the incremental component of revenue in excess of the cost of the underlying service for which taxes were properly paid 
the company believes that the amount accrued is adequate for the satisfaction of this tax liability  including any interest payable 
the company has an installment agreement with the internal revenue service which allows for the company to satisfy the amount outstanding in equal payments of  per month 
historical capital resources 
to date  the external funds necessary to fund the company s capital requirements arising from capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital have been provided primarily from bank credit financing  third party sources of capital and the proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
maximum borrowings under the company s line of credit increased from  in to million in the company s credit facility at june  provided for a borrowing base that was dependent upon the amount and aging of accounts receivable 
as of june   the borrowing base under the credit facility was estimated to be million 
under this facility the interest on the outstanding balance accrued at a rate equal to prime plus at june  
the line of credit was secured by the company s accounts receivable 
as of june   approximately  of borrowings were available under the credit facility 
the company replaced the credit facility under which borrowings at june  were outstanding with a new arrangement effective june  and which funded july  the new agreement bases borrowing capacity on a percentage of the company s outstanding receivables up to a maximum allowable amount of  and allows for the lender to cease funding of new receivables without prior written notice at the lenders option 
interest on the outstanding balance is prime plus per annum 
should the lender cease to provide financing in accordance with its option  the company would be forced to seek immediate replacement of the facility to provide working capital 
current sources of funds from operations and working capital would be insufficient to provide funds adequate to continue funding operations 
in the event the company would be unable to find an immediate replacement of the funds  it would seek an alliance with a strategic partner  or in the event no such strategic alliance were accomplished  the company would be required to seek protection under united states bankruptcy laws 
the company s agreement with at t covers the pricing of the services and establishes minimum semi annual revenue commitments which must be met to receive the contractual price and to avoid shortfall penalties 
at june   the company had not yet reached the completion of the term of the first msarc  however  the company was  below the cumulative pro rata monthly commitment 
should the company continue at similar revenue levels  it would be in a shortfall at the end of the first msarc period in october if the existing contract with at t is terminated  either by the company or by at t for non payment  prior to the expiration of the full term without execution of a new contract  the company will be liable for the total amount of the unsatisfied msarc for the period in which the discontinuance occurs and for of the msarcs for each semi annual period remaining in the contract tariff term 
in addition  should the company fail to meet the first msarc  it will be required to refund  in credits issued to the company by at t 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the contract expires in april the msarcs increase over the term of the contract 
historically  the company has been able to negotiate a settlement of such shortfalls with the carrier which has resulted in no penalty being incurred by the company 
no assurances can be made that the company will be able to reach similar favorable settlements with the carrier should it continue to fail to meet its commitment 
should the company be unable to reach a favorable settlement with the carrier  it would be required to fund the resulting penalties through its operating cash flow  funds available under its existing financing arrangement and working capital 
if required at this time  such funds would not be available to meet the commitments when due and the carrier could terminate the company s underlying service 
during fiscal  the company had moderate expenditures of  on capital items 
included in capital expenditures during fiscal were  to complete the in house proprietary billing system and  on computer related equipment 
the company has no planned capital expenditure budgeted for fiscal year  however  should funds be available  the company intends to continue to modify and improve netbase 
the company has gross deferred tax assets of million for which a valuation allowance of million has been established 
the deferred tax assets arise from deductible temporary differences of million and a net operating loss carryforward of million 
in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance  the company considered its inability to generate taxable income in recent periods  the facts and circumstances which led to the significant operating loss incurred in the years ended june  and  and projections of future taxable income 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  allows for the recognition of deferred tax assets by considering  among other things  the ability of the company to generate future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce tax assets to their expected realizability if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
statement explicitly provides that reaching a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
the company has been in a cumulative loss position at june  the company does not believe that positive evidence of the ability to generate future taxable income is sufficient to counteract the negative evidence  the cumulative losses  and accordingly has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax 
the company generally can be expected to generate taxable income in excess of book income as a result of deductible temporary differences related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
the company continues to pursue the final steps of its financial restructuring an additional financing of between million and million in debt or equity and the agreement to additional concessions from its carriers for special terms and consideration 
in the event the company is unsuccessful in achieving any one or a combination of these objectives sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs  it may seek an alliance with a strategic partner  or in the event no such strategic alliance is accomplished  the company may be required to seek protection under united states bankruptcy laws 
seasonality the company s long distance revenue is subject to seasonal variations 
because most of the company s revenue is generated by non residential customers  the company traditionally experiences decreases in long distance usage and revenue in those periods with holidays 
in past years the company s long distance traffic  which is primarily non residential  has declined slightly during the quarter ending december due to the november and december holiday periods 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations to date 
cautionary statements in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating the likelihood of the company s realization of expectations with respect to operating results and other matters described in this annual report on form k 
see special note regarding forward looking statements on page no assurance of additional necessary capital the company continues to pursue additional financing of between million and million in debt or equity 
if the company is unsuccessful in achieving one or a combination of these objectives sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs  it will be necessary to seek an alliance with a strategic partner  or in the event no such strategic alliance is accomplished  the company may be required to seek protection under united states bankruptcy laws 
attrition rates in the event that the company experiences attrition rates in excess of those anticipated either as a result of increased provisioning times by its underlying carrier  the purchase of poorly performing traffic  or the inability to properly manage the existing customer base  additional charges that affect earnings may be incurred 
dependence on independent marketing agents the company has a small internal sales force and obtains a significant majority of its new customers from independent marketing agents agents 
the company s near term ability to expand its business depends upon whether it can continue to maintain favorable relationships with existing agents and recruit and establish new relationships with additional agents 
no assurances can be made as to the willingness of the existing agents to continue to provide new orders to the company or as to the company s ability to attract and establish relationships with new agents 
dependence on at t and other facilities based carriers the company does not own transmission facilities and currently depends primarily upon at t and  to a lesser extent  upon sprint  through its contract with furst  to provide the telecommunications services that it resells to its customers and the detailed information upon which it bases its customer billings 
the company s near term ability to expand its business depends upon whether it can continue to maintain favorable relationships with at t and sprint 
although the company believes that its relationships with at t and sprint are good and should remain so with continued contract compliance  the loss of the telecommunications services that the company receives from at t or sprint could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
this dependence on the company s primary carrier further manifested itself during the quarter ended march   as continued delays in provisioning activating new customers by the carrier resulted in a backlog of customers who would otherwise have been activated on the company s long distance service and billing 
although the carrier has taken certain steps to decrease the provisioning time which has resulted in an elimination of a significant provisioning backlog  there can be no assurance that similar delays will not occur in the future 
carrier commitments the company has significant commitments with its primary carrier to resell long distance services 
the company s contract with its carrier contains clauses that could materially and adversely impact the company should the company incur a shortfall in meeting its commitments 
although the company has from time to time failed to meet its commitment levels under a particular contract and in each case has been able to negotiate a settlement with the carrier which resulted in no penalty being incurred by the company  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to reach similar favorable settlements with its carriers in the event that the company should fail to meet its future commitments 
the company continues to experience such delays whenever it sends large numbers of new customer orders to at t for provisioning 
in recent years  at t  mci communications corporation mci and sprint have consistently followed one another in pricing their long distance products 
if mci and sprint were to lower their rates for long distance service and at t did not adopt a similar price reduction  adverse customer reaction could affect the company s ability to meet its commitments under the at t contract which could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
developmental problems with netbase netbase plus r  the company s second generation customer management system  was not able to meet the operating requirements of the company 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal the company began reverting to an enhanced version of the original netbase operating system 
although the company successfully completed the reversion in the fourth quarter of fiscal and has made continued improvements to the operating system  to the extent that the company experiences significant growth  the existing netbase operating system may reach technical limitations and hinder reporting visibility to management as well as cause a decline in customer service  thereby negatively impacting attrition levels and  therefore  results of operations 
relationships with state regulatory agencies the company s intrastate long distance telecommunications operations are subject to various state laws and regulations  including prior certification  notification or registration requirements 
the company must generally obtain and maintain certificates of public convenience and necessity from regulatory authorities in most states in which it offers service 
the company is presently responding to consumer protection inquiries from eleven states 
the company believes these inquiries will be resolved satisfactorily  although settlement offers may be made or accepted in instances in which it is determined to be cost effective 
the company currently has recorded an accrual of  for such estimated settlements 
no assurances can be made however  that additional states will not begin inquiries or that the current accrual will be sufficient to provide for existing or future settlements 
failure to resolve inquiries satisfactorily or reach a settlement with the regulatory agencies could  in the extreme  result in the inability of the company to provide long distance service in the jurisdiction requiring regulatory certification 
any failure to maintain proper certification in jurisdictions in which the company provides a significant amount of intrastate long distance service could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  see item  legal proceedings 
volatility of securities prices historically  the market price of the common stock has been highly volatile 
during the last two quarters of fiscal and all of fiscal  the market price for the common stock as reported by the nasdaq stock market has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will remain at any level for any period of time or that it will increase or decrease to any level 
changes in the market price of the common stock may bear no relation to equalnet s actual operational or financial results 
in addition  if the company fails to maintain the minimum bid price requirements of teh nasdaq stock market  the common stock would be subject to delisting therefrom
