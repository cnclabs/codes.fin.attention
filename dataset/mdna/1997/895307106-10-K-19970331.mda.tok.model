the company derives its revenues by providing international and domestic long distance services on a wholesale basis to other telecommunications carriers and resellers and on a retail basis to residential and commercial customers  ranging in size from small businesses to fortune companies 
service revenues are based on minutes of use and charged at a rate per minute which varies according to the termination point of the traffic and time of day

the company believes that it has established the network  operations  customer service  infrastructure and systems necessary to support its expanding sales and customer base for the foreseeable future

in  increased competition drove down wholesale prices 
because of changing market conditions  the company intends to manage its rate of growth to ensure continued profitability in the wholesale division 
the company intends to continue to pursue a growth strategy designed to leverage its network capabilities and further expand its retail sales distribution channels 
the company also intends to continue to pursue its strategy of increasing revenues derived from retail customers 
the company intends to continue to focus its sales and marketing efforts on customers with significant southbound long distance traffic 
these customers include businesses with sales or operations in latin america and the rapidly growing hispanic population in the united states 
cost of services includes those costs associated with the transmission and termination of services over the company s international network 
transmission and termination costs are the company s most significant expense and the company seeks to lower these costs through i increasing volume on its owned facilities  thereby spreading the allocation of fixed costs over a larger number of minutes  ii negotiating lower cost direct operating and transit agreements with ptts and tas  and iii optimizing the routing of calls over the least cost route on its international network 
consistent with its strategy of maximizing traffic carried on the company s own network  the company significantly expanded its network switch capacity in the majority of the company s cost of services is variable and consists of payments for leased capacity from other carriers and payments to ptts and tas with which the company has direct operating and transit agreements 
see item business leased capacity and direct operating and transit agreements 
under its direct operating agreements  the company agrees to send united states originated traffic to the ptts or tas and the ptts or tas agree to send a proportionate amount of return traffic at agreed upon accounting rates 
if there is an imbalance in the volume of traffic sent and received in return  the carrier that originates more traffic pays for the difference to compensate the other carrier 
the difference is the settlement payment 
under the company s direct operating agreements  the company s net settlement revenues and payments are denominated in united states dollars 
the company s profitability is driven by the difference between net revenues and the cost of leased capacity and settlement payments to ptts and tas 
in order to minimize the costs of leased capacity and settlement payments  the company utilizes a least cost routing lcr system designed to transmit the company s traffic over the least cost route choice on its network 
based on fcc data for the period from through  per minute settlement payments from united states carriers to ptts and tas have declined at a significantly faster rate than per minute billed revenues 
due to the wto agreement  the company expects this trend to continue

the company s growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on the company s financial and other resources 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively or new employees are unable to achieve anticipated performance levels  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
competition 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive and affected by rapid regulatory and technological change 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to compete with at t  mci  sprint  ldds wordcom and other united states based and foreign carriers  many of which have considerably greater financial and other resources than the company 
certain of the larger united states based carriers have entered into joint ventures with foreign carriers to provide international services 
in addition  certain foreign carriers have entered into joint ventures with other foreign carriers to provide international services and have begun to compete or invest in the united states market  creating greater competitive pressures on the company 
the ability of the company to compete effectively will depend on its ability to provide high quality service at competitive prices 
regulatory and legislative risks 
federal regulations  regulatory actions and court decisions have had  and may have in the future  negative effects on the company and its ability to compete 
the company is subject to regulation by the fcc and the regulations promulgated by the fcc are subject to change in the future

in most cases  it must also file tariffs for its intrastate offerings 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties or delays in obtaining necessary state authorizations in the future or that such difficulties or delays will not adversely affect the company s business 
the multiplicity of state regulations makes full compliance with all such regulations a challenge for companies such as the company which have certain business activities in numerous states

certain countries are considering opening up their markets to competition 
in the process  they may impose regulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of natural diasters 
areas in which the company conducts its business may be affected by natural diasters including hurricanes and tropical storms as evidenced by hurricane marilyn  which struck certain caribbean islands  including st 
thomas and puerto rico  in september the occurrence of future hurricanes  tropical storms and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business resulting from damages to the company s network facilities or from curtailed telephone traffic resulting from effects of such events  such as destruction of homes and businesses 
unavailability of leased capacity  changes in technology 
the company s profitability will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain and utilize leased capacity on a cost effective basis  on its ability to anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes occurring in the telecommunications industry and on its ability to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet evolving industry standards 
there can be no assurance that leased capacity will be available at cost effective rates in the future or that the company will be able to adapt to such technological changes or offer such products on a timely basis
