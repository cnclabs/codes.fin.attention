item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company is a leading provider of movie based motion simulation theatre attractions to the rapidly expanding out of home entertainment market 
the company is presently in the business of i licensing and distributing the films in its library and the proprietary technologies necessary to produce and exhibit showscan films  ii selling and installing motion simulation attractions and specialty theatres including the equipment necessary for each including projectors  screens  sound systems  synchronization and show control and theatre design packages  iii producing films using the showscan process  and iv establishing motion simulation attractions in which the company has an economic interest o o theatres 
the company is also committed to the continued recognition of the showscan r brand name worldwide 
the principal sources of the company s revenues are the licensing of the showscan film library and technologies  the sale and installation of projectors  screens  sound systems and other equipment used to exhibit showscan films  and the sale of motion bases and other equipment used in most showscan attractions 
the company derived  for the three years ended march   of its revenues from export sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and item business sales and marketing 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on the company s net revenues or on its results of operations for the three most recent fiscal years 
comparison of year ended march  and year ended march  revenues for the fiscal year ended march  hereafter fiscal increased  or from revenues for the fiscal year ended march  hereafter fiscal 
film licensing and production service revenues decreased million or in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to i the renewal of an agreement with the company s major japanese customer imagine japan  which renewal changed the timing of film licensing revenue recognition such that approximately million was recognized in fiscal that would have been recognized in fiscal  ii the inclusion in fiscal of revenues from two specific one time license agreements  which revenues constituted all of the revenues to be received with respect to such agreements  in the amounts of  and  respectively  and iii the early renewals in fiscal of certain film licensing agreements  which renewals changed the timing of film licensing revenue recognition reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal rather than in fiscal of approximately  after adjusting for the aforementioned items  the recurring film licensing revenues were million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues from film licensing are based on new license agreements as well as renewals of existing agreements and results fluctuate from quarter to quarter  with such fluctuations being a result of the seasonality in the way that licensing agreements are entered into and how the license agreements are structured 
revenues from equipment sales and related services increased million or in fiscal the increase is due to an increase in the number of showscan attractions shipped during fiscal as compared to fiscal the actual number of showscan attractions shipped in fiscal increased to units plus the completion of three relocation projects compared to ten such units in fiscal equipment sales in fiscal also included  of one time revenues recognized as a result of the expiration under a customer agreement of a required installation of two theatre sites 
at june   the company had showscan attractions screens with additional showscan attractions screens in its delivery and installation backlog and has contractual commitments for an additional showscan attractions screens in its backlog  as compared to showscan attractions screens with additional showscan attractions screens in its delivery and installation backlog and contractual commitments for showscan attractions screens in its backlog at june  the company did not sell any permanent or temporary specialty theatres in fiscal the company recognizes equipment sales under the percentage of completion method of accounting  generally measured by the percentage that the labor hours incurred to date bears to the estimated total labor hours of each contract 
this results in a disparity in the comparison of equipment sales revenues over different time periods  as the company records revenues under this method rather than on the date that the sales agreement is signed 
the actual signing of a showscan attraction sale precedes its delivery and installation by an average of five to six months 
accordingly  the recognition of revenue for equipment sales during the current and future quarters is affected by i the timing of such sales  ii the schedule of the build out of the showscan attractions  and iii the shipment  delivery and installation of the equipment and related services 
cost of revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of i two one time agreements which were recognized  and  respectively in fiscal  each of which had significantly lower associated cost of revenues  and ii a lower gross profit percentage associated with sales to a major customer in fiscal cost of revenues also increased as a percentage of total revenues because film licensing revenues which traditionally have a higher gross profit margin represented less of a percentage of total revenues in fiscal than in fiscal amortization expense of the film library for fiscal was  up from the amortization expense of  in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased  or in fiscal the decrease can be primarily attributed to an overall reduction in payroll and consultant expense due to the reduction in company staff in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from the decline in business activity 
depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively unchanged in fiscal from fiscal the company accounts for its ownership position in o o theatres using the equity method of accounting 
the equity loss of  on the operations of o o theatres for fiscal was primarily the result of the following factors i expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of future o o theatre locations  ii operating losses at the trocadero in london due to disruptions to theatre operations and attendance caused by the major renovation of the building and the theatre access impediments created thereby  iii operating losses  including start up and marketing expenses at the riverwalk in san antonio  texas  and iv operating losses at the framingham theatres and at citywalk 
although the o o theatre in osaka had an operating profit  the profit was not sufficient to offset the losses of the other o o theatres 
the company earns film licensing revenues from all o o theatres and management fees from some of the o o theatres which are recorded separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  thereby inherently increasing the operating expenses at the specific o o theatres 
a formal claim that was filed with the owner of the trocadero building to recover damages and lost revenues resulting from the renovation of the trocadero building and the related access problems has resulted in a favorable settlement  in which the company holding that theatre will be reimbursed for a portion of the lost revenue incurred during the renovation period 
the company recognized a non cash charge of  in fiscal to record the impact of the adoption of sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of by certain of its o o theatres joint ventures 
the loss was calculated as the excess of the carrying value of joint venture fixed assets for each impaired o o theatre over the estimated discounted cash flows or fair value of each o o theatre impaired 
under the equity method of accounting  the company has recognized its share of the joint venture charges 
the company incurred a net loss of  in fiscal as compared to net income of  recorded in fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in film licensing and production service revenues  an increase in cost of revenues to total revenues  and the performance of the o o theatres  including the effect of the impairment loss on equity in the operations of certain o o theatres joint ventures 
comparison of year ended march  and year ended march  revenues for the fiscal year ended march  hereafter fiscal increased million or from revenues for the fiscal year ended march  hereafter fiscal 
film rentals and royalties increased million or in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the increase in the installed base of operating showscan attractions  renewals on certain licensing contracts which affected the timing of revenue recognition which accounted for  of the increase  the renewal of the imagine japan agreement which increased film revenues by approximately million  and approximately  of revenues from two specific customer agreements  which revenues constitute all of the revenues to be received with respect to such agreements 
on an annual basis  recurring film rentals and royalties should increase over time as the number of operating showscan attractions increases 
revenues from equipment sales and related services decreased million or in fiscal unit sales actually increased in fiscal  but revenues from these sales decreased as a result of the lower than average sales prices 
at june   the company has showscan attractions screens with additional showscan attractions screens in its delivery and installation backlog and has contractual commitments for an additional showscan attractions screens in its backlog  as compared to showscan attractions with additional showscan attractions in its delivery and installation backlog and contractual commitments for showscan attractions in its backlog at june  the company has sold nine permanent and twelve temporary specialty theatres through june  and had sold eight permanent and twelve temporary specialty theatres through june  fiscal equipment sales includes  of revenues recognized as a result of the expiration under a customer agreement of a required installation period for two theatre sites 
the company recognizes equipment sales under the percentage of completion method of accounting  generally measured by the percentage that the labor hours incurred to date bears to the estimated total labor hours of each contract 
this results in a disparity in the comparison of equipment sales revenues over different time periods  as showscan records revenues under this method rather than on the date that the sale agreement is signed 
the actual signing of a showscan attraction sale precedes its delivery and installation by an average of six to seven months 
accordingly  the recognition of revenue for equipment sales during the current and future periods is affected by i the timing of such sales  ii the schedule of the build out of the showscan attractions and iii the shipment  delivery and installation of the equipment and related services 
cost of revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal royalties and film costs as a percentage of film rentals and royalties dropped to in fiscal from in fiscal while equipment cost of sales as a percentage of equipment sales and related services remained constant at for each of the past two fiscal years 
the primary reason for the increase in film rental gross profit is due to the company s purchase in fiscal of the interests held by certain third party producers in two films distributed by the company  so that the company now owns of cosmic pinball and of devil s mine ride 
these purchases resulted in a reduction in payments to third party producers included in cost of revenues 
the increase in film rental gross profit is also attributed to more company owned films being licensed by the venues in fiscal than in the prior years 
amortization expense of the film library for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the company s hiring of additional personnel in fiscal to meet the anticipated levels of showscan attractions sales 
company management also made a decision to enhance the quality of existing product lines and to develop new product lines  both of which involved the continuing employment and hiring of key personnel in the company s engineering and technology departments 
the company believes that there is a cost savings by performing such projects in house  rather than contracting projects out to outside vendors 
in addition  the company increased its bad debt provision by  in fiscal  due to three showscan attraction accounts that became delinquent and eventually were written off as uncollectible 
the closures of two which are higher than the company s historical experience of these showscan attractions were unforeseen by the company at the beginning of fiscal depreciation and amortization remained relatively unchanged during fiscal from fiscal the company develops  through various financing arrangements  showscan attractions in which the company has an ownership interest and accounts for its net ownership position using the equity method of accounting 
the company s loss of  on the operations of owned and operated theatres in fiscal decreased  or from the  loss posted in fiscal this loss is primarily the result of the following factors i expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of future owned and operated theatre locations  ii operating losses  including initial start up and marketing expenses at the framingham theatres opened in late may of which the company has a interest and the edge theatre in san antonio  texas opened in march  of which the company has a interest  and iii the combined operating profits of the owned and operated showscan attractions at citywalk  the trocadero in london  and osaka 
the results of operations showed an improvement for the citywalk and london theatre locations in fiscal from fiscal the company earns film rentals  royalties and management fees from some of the owned and operated theatres  which are recorded separately in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations  thereby inherently increasing the operating expenses at these specific theatres 
interest and other expense increased  or in fiscal the company completed a million million net of expenses private placement of convertible notes through a european financial institution on september  the notes bear interest at per annum with a semi annual interest payment schedule commencing march  interest expense recorded in fiscal related to these notes was  operating income increased in fiscal to an operating profit of  from an operating profit of  in fiscal the increase in operating profit is primarily attributed to the increase in film rentals and royalties for the company offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses 
the company s net income increased to  or per share in fiscal as compared to a  net profit and per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s working capital decreased to  from  at march  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to  from  at march  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the expenditures related to the production of three new motion simulation films and the operating loss for fiscal cash and cash equivalents at march  decreased by  from march  the decrease in cash was primarily due to i the financing of the production of three new films in the amount of  ii the decrease of in accounts payable  customer advances on uncompleted equipment contracts and accrued expenses and other current liabilities  iii significant expenditures in connection with the litigation with imax corporation discussed under item legal proceedings which has been settled by the parties  and iv offset by a  redemption of short term investments 
the changes to receivables  payables  advances and accrued expenses are primarily attributable to variations in the timing of showscan attraction sales and the specific contract terms of such sales  which terms generally affect the timing of collections  shipments  deliveries to customers  installations and the related payments to vendors 
the specific contract terms of each sale also dictate when invoicing occurs 
the decrease in cash and accrued expenses is also attributable to the payment of  in may  for the purchase of additional interests in two films currently in the showscan film library 
net cash flow used in operations was  in fiscal as a result of changes in several categories 
accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased by  while accounts receivable net of the  allowance increased by at march  net cash provided by the company s investing activities was  in fiscal this was the result of  of redemptions in short term investments  offset by  of additions to the company s film library   of investments in o o theatres and  in purchases of equipment 
the company s business strategy includes a significant increase in the installed base of showscan attractions  new film productions  or the securing of distribution rights to motion simulation films produced by other companies  new product development and new product lines  enhancement of existing product lines  possible investments in o o theatres and the reduction of overhead by which was implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
the company intends to finance the foregoing business strategy by utilizing its current working capital resources  the proceeds to be received from its existing backlog and anticipated future product sales and film licensing agreements  together with proceeds derived from one or more of the following financing alternatives the sale of securities  the obtaining of a line of credit from a banking institution  and or the formation of strategic alliances  joint ventures or off balance sheet financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any of the aforementioned financing alternatives 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or is unable to raise additional capital through any of the aforementioned alternatives  the company will need to curtail its business strategy  specifically with regard to new film productions and investments in o o theatres 
the company believes that  given its various business alternatives  its working capital will be sufficient to fund the cost of its operations for the next twelve months 
at march   the company has reserved  shares of common stock for issuance on the exercise of stock options  warrants  preferred stock and convertible notes 
factors that may affect future results portions of this report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the reader is cautioned that all forward looking statements are necessarily speculative and there are certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those referred to in such forward looking statements 
the discussion below  together with portions of the discussion elsewhere in this report  highlight some of the more important risks identified by management of the company but should not be assumed to be the only things that could affect future performance 
period to period fluctuations the company s operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons  including a the timing of sales of the company s motion simulation attractions  b the timing of delivery and installation of such sales pursuant to percentage of completion accounting and any delays therein caused by permitting or construction delays at the customer s site  c the size  type and configuration of the attractions sold  d the timing of film rental payments from existing attractions and the performance of those attractions that pay film rental based on a percentage of box office  and e the timing of sales and marketing efforts and related expenditures 
accordingly  the company s revenues and earnings in any particular period may not be indicative of the results for any future period 
the seasonal fluctuations also cause gyrations in the company s stock price 
the company s performance depends primarily upon the number of motion simulation attractions that it can sell and install 
this dependence has been lessening as the percentage of the company s revenues derived from recurring film licensing revenues has increased though there can be no assurance that this trend will necessarily continue 
the company s results have followed a seasonal pattern  with revenues tending to be stronger in the second and fourth fiscal quarters  reflecting the buying patterns of the company s customers for new motion simulation attractions 
business strategy management of the company has adopted a business strategy that includes substantial investments in its sales and marketing organizations  the creation of new research and development programs and increased funding of existing programs 
this strategy carries with it a number of risks  including a level of operating expenses that may not be adequately covered by increased sales or additional financing may not be available on favorable terms 
this strategy will have to be curtailed if adequate funds are not available 
new product development the company operates in a technology driven segment of the entertainment business 
as such  the company must continually improve its products to increase their entertainment value while also facing pressure to continually reduce the price of its products to respond to competitive pressures 
since the company s main competitors  iwerks entertainment  inc and imax corporation  have significantly more capital than the company  the company has had to rely more on its suppliers and other third parties to improve the company s existing products and to develop new ones 
the inability of the company to develop new products and to respond to technological developments of its competitors could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  operations and financial condition 
international operations a significant portion of the company s revenue is from sales and film licensing outside the united states 
the company s results could be negatively affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  trade protection measures  policies with respect to currency and fiscal controls  longer accounts receivable collection patterns  changes in regional or worldwide economic or political conditions  or natural disasters 
though the company faces less direct exchange rate risks since nearly all of its contracts are denominated in united states dollars  fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly affect the affordability of the company s products and services overseas 
intellectual property the company has several united states patents on various processes and elements related to film projection and motion simulation 
the most important of these patents expire in october though the company s patents have never been challenged and the company believes that they are valid  third parties could still challenge the patents and a court could determine that one or more of them are invalid 
declarations of invalidity  particularly of the company s key patents  could adversely affect the marketability of the company s products and services 
in addition  the company always faces the risk that new technologies could be discovered that are superior to the company s patents 
competition the company faces intense competition in all of its product lines 
in the motion simulation business  the company s main competitor is iwerks though there are an increasing number of smaller competitors 
iwerks has substantially greater financial resources than the company and as such may be able to both price its existing products and services lower than the company as well as produce new products 
imax is a growing competitor of the company in this segment and has dedicated substantial resources to entering this market 
in the large screen  special format motion picture business  the company s main competitor is imax though iwerks is also very significant 
the format appears to be emerging as the most popular large format due primarily to the large number of films available in that format 
imax is by far the dominant company in this market 
the company is only a recent entrant into this market and has not yet made any sales 
the company will have to continue to invest funds in order to broaden its position in the market and thus short term results could be adversely affected until sales can be made 
business disruption the company s corporate headquarters  including its research and development operations  are located in los angeles  california  a region known for seismic activity 
operating results could be materially affected by a significant earthquake or other natural disaster 
dependence on major customers the company s motion simulation business has two significant concentrations 
the first concentration involves ongoing film licenses and is located in japan where imagine japan presently operates or is otherwise responsible for fifteen simulation attractions 
the second concentration relates to the company s sales backlog where ua and king s entertainment co  ltd 
individually and collectively represent a substantial portion of the outstanding equipment orders to be delivered in the next few years 
in fiscal  the company earned revenues from imagine japan and ua in the amount of  the company s short and long term performance could be adversely impacted if disruptions were to occur in any of these areas of concentration such as order cancellations  license terminations or payment problems 
ability to produce additional films one of the primary factors considered by potential purchasers of motion simulation attractions is the quality and extent of the films available to be shown at the attraction 
the company believes that a large portion of its competitive advantage resides in its popular and extensive library of ride films 
to maintain this competitive edge  the company must produce or acquire the distribution rights to several new films each year 
film production is expensive and requires the investment of company funds to the extent that investors cannot be located with no assurance that the films produced will be popular 
iwerks and imax have each indicated that they are devoting substantial portions of their assets to the production of new motion simulation films 
both the short and long term financial performance of the company will be adversely affected if the perceived quality and popularity of the company s film library declines either alone or in comparison to the films of the company s competitors
