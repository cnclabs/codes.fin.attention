item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation dollars in thousands s  except per share amounts general the company considers the adhesive backed materials industry to be over billion  consisting of the billion total tape market and the billion adhesive backed label stock market 
the company is one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of carton sealing tape and adhesive backed label stock products in the united states 
central products branded and private label carton sealing tape products are used primarily for commercial packaging applications  including the packaging of goods for shipment by manufacturing  retail and distribution companies  and are sold through its national sales force to over  paper and office products distributors nationwide 
brown bridge offers a full line of more than  variations of label stock and sells its products in roll or sheet form to over  printers  paper merchants and industrial users  who convert the label stock into labels used for a broad range of end use applications  including bar coding  mailing and shipping  packaging for pharmaceutical  food and other consumer products  office identification and business forms  postage stamp stock  decorative labels and other specialty industrial uses 
the company also manufactures and markets industrial process equipment and air pollution control scrubbers through entoleter 
the company has experienced rapid growth which has been accomplished through internal growth and the acquisitions of central products and brown bridge 
the internal growth is a result of refocused sales and marketing strategy at all subsidiaries 
management believes that at the time of the respective acquisitions  each of the companies acquired was an underperforming operation 
with the brown bridge acquisition  the company entered the adhesive backed materials industry 
the central products acquisition provided the company with a leading position in the carton sealing tape market of the adhesive backed materials industry 
as a result of the acquisitions of brown bridge and central products  the company became a manufacturer of the broadest line of adhesive backed label stock and carton sealing tape products in the adhesive backed materials industry 
subsequent to each of the foregoing acquisitions  the company implemented cost reduction measures  including more effective management  rationalization of raw materials and component purchasing  improved materials flow and improved management information systems 
the company believes such measures will contribute to improved operating profits at central products and brown bridge during the company has historically operated at a high level of capacity utilization and has increased capacity of the acquired plant facilities through operating efficiency improvements 
for example  in order to meet production capacity requirements under the postage stamp stock agreements awarded to brown bridge in and  brown bridge invested approximately  to add a production line to manufacture silicone liner  a portion of which was outsourced in the company incurred higher cost of sales approximately  for the year ended december  as a result of outsourcing a portion of its production requirements 
the installation of the additional production line was completed by the end of the fourth quarter of and is now fully operational  which will enable it to meet its future silicone liner production requirements and substantially reduce costs associated with its current level of outsourcing silicone liner 
the cost of the company s principal raw materials  polypropylene resin and paper  have generally remained stable over the past several years 
during fiscal  however  raw material cost increases resulted in the company instituting higher prices  consistent with the increases instituted by its competitors  during for its carton sealing tape and adhesive backed label stock products 
the increases in raw material costs during fiscal on the company s products did not materially impact the company s gross profit because the company was generally able to pass along its raw material cost increases without negatively impacting sales of its products 
during fiscal  the company s principal raw material costs generally remained stable or declined 
the company is not aware of any significant cost increases planned by its raw material suppliers for fiscal the company s supply agreement with the postal service provides that the postal service will absorb limited price increases in the company s raw materials 
consequently  to protect against raw material price increases in excess of those permitted under the postal service contract  the company has entered into supply agreements with its raw materials suppliers that have ceilings on future price increases 
other agreements under which the company s carton sealing tape products and a portion of its adhesive backed label stock products are sold do not contain adjustment mechanisms for fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  although the company has generally passed along raw material price changes for products sold under such agreements  as well as for products sold to other customers 
the future impact of a change in raw material costs on the company s profitability is based in part on pricing from the company s competitors 
although historically the company has generally been able to pass through raw material cost fluctuations  the company cannot be assured that future raw material cost increases can be passed through to its customers and that such cost increases will not negatively impact the company s gross profit 
fiscal compared to fiscal introduction fiscal was highlighted by several transactions unique to operations as compared to previous fiscal years 
during  the registrant completed a financial reorganization to improve the registrant s capital structure and provide a source of long term financing 
in the fourth quarter of the registrant issued  of senior secured notes notes or senior notes 
the notes require semi annual interest payments and mature october proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to extinguish certain term obligations and all working capital revolver obligations then outstanding 
in addition  the registrant established a  asset backed senior secured revolving credit facility revolving credit facility  of which all but approximately is currently available 
a portion of the revolving credit facility may be used to fund acquisitions 
in the same quarter  concurrent with the issuance of the senior notes  the registrant acquired the minority interest in its brown bridge subsidiary 
the terms of the acquisition involved a cash payment  issuance of registrant common stock and a right to a contingent payment 
fiscal is the first full year of operations to include central products  as on october   the registrant  through its wholly owned subsidiary  purchased the stock and assets of alco standard corporation s central products operation  which manufactures a variety of carton sealing tapes 
therefore  includes twelve months of operations at central products compared to three months in sales 
the registrant s net sales were  an increase of when compared with net sales in the increase in net sales was the result of the central products acquisition  improved marketing efforts at central products and the growth at brown bridge  the registrant s other adhesive backed materials subsidiary 
brown bridge s units increased approximately on the strength of a refocused sales and marketing strategy inclusive of two long term contracts for the supply of us postage stamp paper stock 
central products improved marketing efforts and relationships with its national accounts  in an extremely competitive pricing market  increased pressure sensitive tape units approximately 
the central products acquisition accounts for approximately  of the year on year increase based on historical pro forma operating data 
cost of sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased from in to in  increasing the registrant s gross profit percentage 
these favorable results were despite the negative impact to gross profit of approximately  of outsourcing penalties associated with the capacity constraints at brown bridge attributable to its overall growth  in particular  the growth from two pressure sensitive us postage contracts 
in the future  these capacity constraints should be eliminated through the installation of a new silicone coater  which became fully operational at the close of the registrant believes that the new silicone coater will enable it to substantially reduce costs associated with its current level of outsourcing silicone liner
