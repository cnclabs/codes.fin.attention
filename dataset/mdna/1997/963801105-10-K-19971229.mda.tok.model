based on the decision to sell the technologies division  the division has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  a million reserve for anticipated losses and the cost of disposition was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company estimates that the changes associated with the closing of the corporate office and related severance payments will result in a net charge to earnings during the first quarter of fiscal of approximately  the following discussion takes into account the treatment of the technologies division as a discontinued operation 
results of operations fiscal  and net sales attributable to the microelectronics division were   and  respectively 
the increase in net sales between fiscal and was caused by the initial stocking orders for distributors in the second quarter  increased custom orders in the fourth quarter  and new products which were introduced in the prior year 
the increase in net sales from to was the result of an increase in the standard military memory product line partially offset by a decrease in custom military products 
the company continues to believe that changes in us defense spending will not have a material adverse effect on the company s overall results  particularly on the white microelectronics division 
in  the company nevertheless continued to pursue its goal of reduced dependency on the defense industry by pursuing commercial business while emphasizing niche military markets where it has a competitive advantage 
gross margins in the microelectronics division were approximately million or as compared to million or in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the increased sales 
the decline in the gross margin percentage was a result of strong downward pressure on pricing brought about by a very competitive market which the company expects will continue in fiscal gross margins in fiscal for this division were approximately as compared to million or in fiscal the increase was due to improved margins in the standard military memory product line 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were above expenses 
the main reason for the increase was an increase in advertising and sales commissions relating to the increased sales volume 
legal expenses also increased in primarily as a result of the investigation by the us attorney s office as discussed in item the remainder of the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was attributed to higher payroll related expenses due to the increased number of employees 
the selling  general and administrative expenses approximated the expenses 
product development expense in fiscal increased by  or from the main reason for the increase was the additional spending on developing a microprocessor module in conjunction with the diehl business development alliance 
product development expense was  higher than due to increased spending on new products in fiscal interest expense in fiscal declined as a result of both lower rates and decreased average borrowing levels as compared to this also explains the lower interest expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal other expense in fiscal consists primarily of a one time  write down on the company s acton  massachusetts property held for sale 
the building is currently under contract for sale  and as a result of the write down the company anticipates no further loss on the sale 
however  the loss of rental income from this property will lower other income by approximately  for the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the same quarter in until the building is sold  it is anticipated that the cost of maintaining the building and the related taxes will be  per quarter 
the offsetting other income is attributed to the proceeds from the acton leased facility until lease expiration in february  and a  gain on the sale of a stock investment by the company 
there was no significant difference in other income between fiscal and the company is subject to the alternative minimum tax which  when combined with state taxes  and deferred taxes resulted in a tax provision benefit from continuing operations of   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
financial condition  capital resources and liquidity fiscal year end working capital increased to  from  at september  changes in the components of working capital are detailed in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company s current ratio at fiscal year end is approximately to its total debt to equity ratio improved to approximately to the company s capital expenditure plans are principally to expand manufacturing capacity and are expected to be financed largely through leasing arrangements and  to a lesser extent  through funds provided from operations 
management believes that cash generated by operations  in addition to the company s borrowing capability  should be sufficient to fund the company s cash needs for the foreseeable future 
in fiscal and  the company generated  and  respectively of cash from operating activities 
management anticipates that operations will continue to generate cash in the foreseeable future 
management also anticipates that for the near term its cash payments for federal income taxes will be based on rates applicable to the alternative minimum tax as it uses its net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has reviewed the effect of the year on its various systems 
management has devised and is implementing a plan to ensure that this problem does not affect the operations of the company 
the plan consists of both modifying existing systems and implementing new systems where there are additional factors that would warrant a new system  it is not anticipated that the costs related to resolving this issue will be material 
discontinued operations the  decline in sales between fiscal and is a result of the sale of the rapid heat sterilizer rht and ordnance product lines in late fiscal which was partially offset by an increase in mechanical products 
the  decline in sales when fiscal is compared to fiscal was a result of declines in sales in the ordnance and rht product lines  which were sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal interface product sales also declined as a result of increased competition 
gross margin dollars in fiscal were only slightly lower than fiscal  even though sales declined 
this was a result of improved product mix and improved efficiency in the manufacturing process 
gross margin dollars declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of decreased sales  which were partially offset by improved product mix in the latter part of fiscal operating expenses increased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to an effort to increase bookings 
the  decrease in fiscal from fiscal was a result of write offs in fiscal related to the rht product line and lower costs in fiscal as a result of lower sales and cost reduction efforts 
product development decreased significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal because the product development expenses related to the rht and the dental market were curtailed in fiscal in addition to the previous expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal a  reserve was recorded for costs associated with the sale of the technologies division 
this amount includes  for estimated future operating losses during the phase out period 
the actual performance of the discontinued operation may be different than management estimates
