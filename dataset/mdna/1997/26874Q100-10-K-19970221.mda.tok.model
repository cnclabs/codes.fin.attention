item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment ensco international incorporated the company is one of the largest providers of offshore drilling services and marine transportation services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s operations are conducted in the geographic cores of north america  europe  asia and south america 
the company s largest geographic core is north america where the company operates primarily in the gulf of mexico 
the europe operations are concentrated in the north sea and the south america operations are currently conducted on lake maracaibo  venezuela 
demand for the company s services is significantly affected by worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling 
expenditures for oil and gas drilling activity fluctuate based upon many factors including world economic conditions  the legislative environment in the us and other major countries  production levels and other activities of opec and other oil and gas producers and the impact that these and other events have on the current and expected future pricing of oil and natural gas 
worldwide drilling activity in continued to demonstrate a sustained recovery as supply and demand in the offshore drilling market reached near equilibrium  a level not attained since the early s 
the increase in drilling activity pushed day rates to levels not experienced since the early s as well 
these increases are primarily driven by the strengthening of oil and natural gas prices and new technologies which are making exploration and production more cost effective for the company s customers 
with expected capital expenditure increases for major and independent oil companies in  the company anticipates that the offshore drilling market will remain strong unless there is a significant deterioration in oil and natural gas prices 
the company s results have benefitted from the increase in drilling activity discussed above 
of the geographical markets in which the company operates  the gulf of mexico and the north sea experienced the most significant impact from the increased drilling activity in the asia market in general did not experience the same level of increased activity as the gulf of mexico and the north sea for most of recently  the asia market has shown significant improvement and the company believes the asia market will continue to improve in as all offshore drilling markets in general continue to tighten 
the company s south america barge drilling rigs operate under long term contracts with lagoven sa lagoven  a subsidiary of venezuela s national oil company 
as a result  their day rate and utilization levels are not as dependent on oil and natural gas prices 
activity levels for the company s marine transportation vessels generally correspond with the activity levels for the company s drilling rigs operating in the gulf of mexico

in addition  the acquired dual north america jackup rigs contributed million in revenue and million in operating margin  representing and of the respective increases 
the significant percent increase in operating margin as compared to the percent increase in revenue is attributable to the fact that operating costs for rigs are relatively fixed once a rig is fully utilized  and therefore additional revenues significantly impact the operating margin 
for the year ended december   revenues from the company s north america jackup rigs increased by and operating margin decreased by as compared to the revenue increase is primarily due to an increase in operating days related to the relocation of two of the company s jackup rigs to the gulf of mexico in  one from south america which commenced operations in the third quarter of and one from asia which commenced operations in the third quarter of the cost to mobilize the two jackup rigs totalled million and was charged against earnings  resulting in negative operating margins for the asia and south america jackup rigs in the revenue increase was partially offset by  and the operating margin decrease was primarily attributable to  a decrease of approximately  in average day rates
