item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share data references to notes are references to notes to consolidated financial statements on october   the company sold its packaging businesses  as discussed in discontinued operations and in note the consolidated statement of operations of the company has been restated to report separately the operating results and the gain on the sale of the packaging businesses as discontinued operations 
the consolidated balance sheet and cash flow statement were not restated 
the company s continuing operations are divided into two segments engineered materials and handling 
for certain information regarding these segments and geographic regions  see note results of operations net sales from continuing operations were  and  respectively  in  and net sales in the engineered materials segment were up in sales in the aerospace components business increased as shipment levels increased on several key engine programs  while sales of metal powders by the special materials business posted a small decline 
handling sales were up in  as north american and asia pacific sales again reached record levels 
in  in the engineered materials segment  strong north american auto and light truck production led to a increase in sales of metal powders  while sales of the aerospace components business increased by as several newer engine programs reached the production stage 
handling sales were up in  primarily as a result of strong demand in the us and asia pacific markets 
in  the weakening of the us dollar against most foreign currencies added to sales from continuing operations compared with the years and were week periods  while was a week period 
operating profit was  and  respectively  in  and in  operating profit benefitted from the adoption of a fair value approach with respect to accounting for the company s employee stock ownership plan esop  as discussed in note  along with changes in the assumptions used in calculating the company s liability for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits and the elimination of such benefits for certain active domestic employees  as discussed in note the combined effect of these changes was a favorable adjustment to operating profit of in  a one time provision of was incurred to reduce fixed costs at the european handling business 
in  a charge of was taken to write down goodwill of continuing operations  as discussed in long lived assets and in note excluding the favorable adjustments to income in  the charge to reduce fixed costs  and the goodwill charge in  operating profit was  and in  and  respectively 
operating profit in benefitted from improved results in aerospace components and the north american handling operation  offset in part by reduced earnings in special materials and the handling operations in europe and asia pacific 
operating profit in benefitted from increased volumes at nearly all businesses and improved selling prices in the north american handling business 
from to  special materials shipments of metal powders grew by  as increased usage of metal powders in automotive and nonautomotive applications offset the impact of a small reduction in north american automobile and truck production from peak levels 
at aerospace components  commercial  military and space fabrication sales in continued to increase  growing by since repair sales increased in compared with  reflecting a resurgence in demand from the airline industry 
in handling  sales were ahead of and in north american and asia pacific markets  but were lower in europe where the economic environment continued to be soft 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in both and  and in as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were in and in and the following business segment commentary reflects the goodwill write down 
however  the discussion of individual business unit results is presented before this charge  before allocation of general corporate expenses  and before the favorable esop adjustment see note 
see note for further information on business segments 
net sales and operating profit by business segment in millions net sales operating profit engineered materials special materials aerospace components goodwill write down handling corporate items total net sales total operating profit engineered materials engineered materials includes special materials metal powders for manufacturing precision parts and aerospace components precision machined structures  complex fabrications and jet engine component repairs 
sales increased in in the engineered materials segment 
north american automobile and light truck production remained essentially level in compared with special materials shipments decreased from  due to competitive pressures in non proprietary powders and the disruption of powder metal usage by several strikes in the automotive industry 
aerospace components sales were up  with increased fabrication shipments on several newer commercial  military and space programs and higher sales on certain repair programs 
aerospace components defense related business represented approximately  and of its sales in  and  respectively 
defense related sales as a percentage of the company s consolidated sales were approximately in and in each of and facing the slowdown in military procurement in the early s  the fabrication business of aerospace components executed a strategy of increasing its penetration of the commercial and space sectors  while continuing to secure new military business 
the business developed expertise in fabrication of the very large components used on new high thrust commercial jet engines and on space applications 
sales to the commercial and space sectors more than doubled from to repair sales increased in the increased volume of business reflected higher utilization rates of certain aircraft engines  along with several programs to perform blade modifications recommended by engine manufacturers 
operating profit for the engineered materials segment increased in over special materials operating profit declined  as lower production volume and higher expenses were only partially offset by higher selling prices and the favorable effects of the postretirement medical and life adjustments described in note at aerospace components  operating profit was up in higher volume and increased manufacturing efficiency on several newer fabrication programs  along with operational improvements in the repair business  all contributed to the earnings improvement 
sales increased in in the engineered materials segment  reflecting a second successive year of record shipments of metal powders 
special materials shipments were up from  driven by increased penetration by powder metallurgy in automotive and nonautomotive applications 
aerospace components sales were up  with increased fabrication shipments on several newer commercial and military programs and higher sales on several repair programs 
operating profit for the segment increased in  excluding the impact of a special charge in including the effect of the goodwill write down  as discussed in long lived assets and in note  operating profit increased by special materials operating profit was up  reflecting the record volume 
in the aerospace components business  higher volume and improved manufacturing efficiency led to a increase in operating profit in  despite a one time gain in from settlement of a real estate matter 
see nonoperating items 
the engineered materials segment s order backlog at year end was  up from at the end of special materials backlog  which is generally short term in nature  was down from increased orders on several commercial programs resulted in a increase in backlog at aerospace components at year end  to the highest level since handling total segment sales in were up from  at comparable exchange rates 
demand for material handling products in north america continued to be strong after a substantial improvement in  but pricing pressure held sales growth to in a increase in sales in asia pacific reflected opportunities presented by the withdrawal of a conveyor competitor  expanded pacific rim activity and favorable exchange rates in relation to the us dollar  which offset the impact of a slowdown in the australian economy 
european handling sales were essentially level  as increased uk sales were offset by lower sales in germany and unfavorable exchange rate changes 
segment operating profit increased in the third quarter of included a one time provision of related to reducing fixed costs in the uk and germany 
excluding this provision  operating profit was up from the prior year  as higher volume  lower steel costs  lower expenses in europe  and the effects of the postretirement medical and life benefits and esop adjustments were partially offset by lower prices 
north american handling profit was up  driven by lower steel costs and additional volume 
excluding the impact of the provision to reduce fixed costs  operating profit for the european handling business declined in  as the competitive pricing environment offset the benefits of lower steel costs and expense savings 
the benefit from additional sales at handling asia pacific was absorbed by a less favorable mix  the unfavorable impact of a strong australian currency in the pacific rim  higher manufacturing costs and increased selling and administrative expenses 
as a result  earnings declined by in total handling sales in were higher than in  with both north american and asia pacific businesses achieving record sales for a second successive year 
strong demand for material handling products in the us led to then record volumes and higher pricing  and generated a increase in sales 
higher australian and pacific rim demand led to a increase in asia pacific sales 
a increase in european handling sales reflected favorable exchange rates and increased sales of conveyors and interiors products 
in  handling operating profit was up 
north american handling profit was up reflecting then record volume and improved pricing  partially offset by a increase in steel costs 
the then record volume at handling asia pacific contributed to a increase in operating profit in that business 
operating profit for the european handling business was down  as higher selling prices did not cover increased steel costs and the provision incurred in connection with the reduction of fixed costs in the uk and germany 
handling ended with an order backlog of  up from at the end of at comparable exchange rates  due mainly to strong order intake at asia pacific 
long lived assets in  the company concluded that  in the light of its highly leveraged capital structure  a preferable accounting policy for analyzing the valuation of long lived assets would be to reflect its cost of capital in computing the present value of the expected cash flows of its businesses 
applying this policy to all of its long lived assets  the company determined that with respect to its aerospace components and its since disposed of newspaper related packaging businesses  in the light of the significant deterioration in business climates in the aerospace and newspaper industries over the preceding years  the values of the discounted cash flows were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets 
therefore  the goodwill component of those assets was deemed to be impaired 
as a result  a charge of was taken  in continuing operations for the write down of goodwill established in connection with the acquisition of the aerospace components business and in discontinued operations for the write down of goodwill in connection with the newspaper related packaging businesses 
in  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this change in accounting policy did not require an adjustment to income 
see note interest expense the company has a highly leveraged capital structure with substantial net interest expense of  and in  and  respectively  after allocation of interest to discontinued operations based on an assumed debt paydown of increased expense in reflected the effect of replacement of a portion of the company s bank debt with senior notes bearing higher interest rates  as well as higher rates on the remaining bank debt 
nonoperating items the company has certain income and expenses that are not related to its ongoing operations 
ongoing postretirement expenses attributable to disposed or previously discontinued operations are reported as nonoperating items 
in  nonoperating items benefitted from a change in the assumptions used in calculating the company s liability for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for the former employees of disposed or previously discontinued operations 
the effect of this change resulted in a favorable adjustment to nonoperating income of in  nonoperating income included a one time gain for settlement of a real estate matter with a local transportation authority at aerospace components 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the investigation and remediation of a superfund site in duluth  minnesota 
based on the company s current estimates of its potential liabilities related to the site  the company believes that this matter is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity or consolidated financial condition 
however  the company s current estimate of its potential environmental liabilities is subject to considerable uncertainty related to the possible remediation of certain underwater sediments at the site 
see note the company is a claimant in an action in federal district court in toledo  ohio  in which it seeks indemnification from beazer east  inc under the terms of a sale agreement 
the action concerns response costs incurred or to be incurred in the future by the city of toledo in connection with the alleged contamination of a acre parcel of land owned by the city that formerly was the site of a coke plant and related by products facilities 
see note the company s hoeganaes corporation subsidiary is a defendant in an action in federal district court in trenton  new jersey  brought by sc holdings  inc  a subsidiary of waste management international plc 
the plaintiff seeks to recover amounts expended or to be expended in investigation and remediation of the cinnaminson groundwater contamination site in burlington county  new jersey  which encompasses a landfill formerly operated by the plaintiff and may also include the groundwater under a hoeganaes facility 
sc holdings alleges that hoeganaes has liability both as an owner operator and as a generator 
the company believes that hoeganaes has meritorious defenses against both alleged bases of liability 
see note in may  the company instituted an action seeking a declaratory judgment against and recoveries from insurers in connection with environmental claims under policies covering nearly years 
provision for income taxes in  and  high levels of interest expense and differences in the timing of income and expense recognition for financial reporting and income tax purposes resulted in losses from continuing operations for us federal income tax purposes 
since most of the interest expense is borne in the united states at the parent company level  throughout each period the company had taxable income in foreign and state jurisdictions despite the high levels of consolidated interest expense 
for each period presented  the company also provided for additional amounts related to open federal tax return years through the write down of goodwill in did not result in a deduction allowable for tax purposes 
in  taxes of were recognized in respect of the gain on the sale of the packaging businesses  and were reported as a component of income from discontinued operations 
see note the company s us federal income tax returns for the years through are in the process of examination 
resolution of tax years is pending at the us tax court following receipt of a statutory notice of deficiency for plus interest and penalties 
resolution of tax years is pending at the appeals division of the internal revenue service 
the company believes that adequate provision has been made for possible assessments of additional taxes 
discontinued operations on october   the company sold its packaging businesses to samuel manu tech inc  of etobicoke  ontario  canada  for the consolidated financial statements of the company have been restated to report separately the operating results and the gain on the sale of the packaging businesses as discontinued operations 
in  income from discontinued operations of per share consisted of a gain of net of income taxes on the sale  income from operations and 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
income from operations for the packaging businesses in included a benefit of 
from changes in the assumptions used in calculating the company s liability for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits and the elimination of such benefits for certain active domestic employees 
see notes and extraordinary loss during the fourth quarter of  the company repurchased in the open market of its senior subordinated debentures  at a premium of in addition  debt issuance costs of 
associated with the repurchased debentures were written off 
the total of these amounts was shown as an extraordinary item 
during the second quarter of  the company issued of senior notes due and completed a substantial amendment to the company s senior bank credit agreement 
the proceeds were used to retire a portion of the company s bank debt 
debt issuance costs of associated with the retired debt were written off  without any currently usable tax benefit in  and shown as an extraordinary item 
see notes and cumulative effect of accounting change in  the company changed its method of amortizing unrecognized actuarial gains and losses with respect to its postretirement benefits to amortize them over a five year period 
this change has been accounted for as a change in accounting principle  the cumulative effect of which was recorded as of the beginning of the year 
as a result  net income for was increased by in respect of continuing operations and 
in respect of discontinued operations 
see note liquidity and capital resources the company s total debt at year end was  down from year end cash totaled at the end of the year  up from year end in early  the company purchased of its senior notes in the open market 
during  the company has debt amortization requirements of current levels of performance  if maintained throughout the year  will provide the company with leeway under its bank credit agreement covenants 
the company believes that it will have adequate liquidity to meet its debt service and operating requirements in based on expected operating cash flow and the availability of additional revolver borrowings under the company s bank credit agreement 
see note in  the company has debt amortization requirements of  which it does not expect to be able to meet from operating cash flow 
the company continues to evaluate alternative actions to repay or refinance some or all of its long term debt obligations 
a component of the company s refinancing strategy could be the divestiture of operating units 
consistent with this possibility  the company announced in the first quarter of that it is exploring the possible sale of the businesses that comprise its handling segment 
any divestiture of the handling businesses would likely result in a reduction in net income  with a corresponding impact on the company s debt ratios  in the short term  however  the company believes that a sale of handling at an appropriate price would enable the company to concentrate its resources on its businesses in the engineered materials segment  would provide the company with greater flexibility in its efforts to improve the company s capital structure and would allow the reduction of corporate costs 
the company has not reached any agreements or understandings with respect to any sale  and there is no assurance that it will do so 
cash flow see consolidated statement of cash flows cash outflow used by operating activities was in  while cash inflows provided by operating activities were and in and  respectively 
strong fourth quarter operating activity in the handling businesses and the ramp up of engine programs in aerospace components contributed to increased working capital requirements of in  compared with in and in in  other operating adjustments included payment of certain tax liabilities that had been classified as long term  while in  other operating adjustments reflected the movement of certain expected tax liabilities from current to long term 
cash flow was not affected by either the favorable adjustments to earnings in respect of postretirement medical and life insurance benefits and the accounting for the esop  or the goodwill charges in the cash inflow provided by investing activities in was  including proceeds on the sale of the packaging businesses 
cash outflows used by investing activities were and respectively  in and capital expenditures for expansion projects totaled  and  respectively  in  and expansion spending in included the addition of an annealing furnace to expand capacity at the special materials operation  and equipment and facilities to accommodate fabrication of new engine programs at the aerospace components operation 
expansion spending in included milling and machining equipment for the aerospace components operation  while spending in included the completion of two annealing furnaces to expand capacity at the special materials operation 
management believes that capital expenditures have been adequate to properly maintain the company s businesses and provide for anticipated growth opportunities 
the company expects that capital spending will be approximately cash outflows used by financing activities were  and 
in  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  following the sale of its packaging businesses  the company repaid in bank debt and purchased in the open market of its senior subordinated debentures 
foreign operations the company does business in a number of foreign countries  mainly through its handling segment 
the results of these operations are initially measured in local currencies  principally in british pounds  australian dollars and german marks  and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates 
the reported results of these operations are sensitive to changes in applicable foreign exchange rates that could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
during  the dollar was generally stronger against most currencies  which had an unfavorable impact of on sales from continuing operations  while in  the dollar was weaker against most currencies  which had a favorable impact on sales of the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on operating profit was insignificant 
for additional information about the company s operations by geographic area  see note effects of inflation the impact of inflation on the company in recent years has not been material  and it is not expected to have a significant effect in the foreseeable future
