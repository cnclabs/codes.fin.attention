the company s ratio of ebitda to cash interest expense defined as interest expense less amortization of deferred financing costs was to in compared with to for ebitda during significantly exceeded capital expenditures in core and growth markets of million and scheduled interest payments of million 
the company considers ebitda to be a meaningful measure for assessing operating performance 
ebitda can be used to measure the company s ability to service debt  fund capital investments and expand its business 
ebitda information should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash flows from operations  or any other operating or liquidity performance measure recognized by generally accepted accounting principles gaap

the following is a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss in millions ebitda interest expense provision for income taxes extraordinary item  net of taxes depreciation and amortization writedowns of long lived assets restructuring and other special charges  net other non cash items net income loss impairments of long lived assets effective september   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

under sfas no 
 the company reviews its long lived assets such as property and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset is recognized 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future cash flows  as determined by management  after considering such factors as future air travel and toll paying vehicle data and inflation 
historically  the company reviewed such assets for impairment by grouping along its three general business lines ie  airports  travel plazas and shopping mall and entertainment concessions 
although the company has been aware that certain operating units were generating losses and cash flow deficits since the late s  because the estimated future undiscounted cash flows on a business line basis exceeded the carrying amount of the company s long lived assets on a business line basis  the company offset such negative cash flows with positive cash flows from other operating units and did not recognize any impairment charges in or  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the company is required to assess impairment of its long lived assets at the operating unit level representing the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
generally  each airport and shopping mall and entertainment facility at which the company operates and each tollroad on which the company operates as opposed to each travel plaza on a tollroad comprises an operating unit 
as a result of its adoption of sfas no 
 the company recognized a non cash  pretax charge against earnings during the fourth quarter of of million 
in adopting sfas no 
and thereby changing its method of measuring long lived asset impairments from a business line basis to an individual operating unit basis  the company wrote down the assets of operating units to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value of the assets in twelve of the fifteen units had projected cash flow deficits  and  accordingly the assets of these units were written off in their entirety 
the remaining three units had projected positive cash flows and the assets were partially written down to their estimated fair values 
approximately of the total write down of million related to two operating units one tollroad unit and one airport unit 
historically  the company has incurred negative cash flows at of the individual operating units  which aggregated approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  and were included in the company s reported cash flows from operations 
during  five of the original impaired units were either disposed of or the lease term expired 
as of the end of  the total cash flow deficit including operating cash flows and necessary capital expenditures from the remaining operating units was projected to be approximately million during the remaining terms of the lease agreements 
substantially all of the remaining deficit is attributable to three operating units  which include two airport units and one tollroad unit 
restructuring during  the company performed a review of its operating structure and core business processes to identify opportunities to improve operating effectiveness 
as a result of this review  management approved a formal restructuring plan in october and the company recorded a pretax restructuring charge to earnings of million in the fourth quarter of the restructuring charge was primarily comprised of involuntary employee termination benefits related to its realignment of operational responsibilities and lease cancellation penalty fees and related costs resulting from the company s plan to exit certain activities in its shopping mall and entertainment business line 
the employee termination benefits included in the restructuring charge reflect the immediate elimination of approximately corporate and field operations positions and the elimination of approximately additional field operations positions  all of which were specifically identified in the restructuring plan 
certain initiatives of the restructuring plan were scheduled to be systematically implemented throughout the duration of the plan  resulting in an extended period over which the additional field operations positions would be eliminated 
the company expects to complete its plan to involuntarily terminate employees by the end of the second quarter of  although severance payments are expected to continue beyond the end of the second quarter of due to the provisions of the severance program that allow for extended severance payments 
termination benefits accrued and charged to expense in amounted to million and are included in restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
actual termination benefits paid and charged against the liability as of january  were million 
as of the end of fiscal year  the company had terminated positions in connection with the restructuring plan 
the exit plan specifically identified ten operating units in the company s shopping mall and entertainment business line that were to be closed 
these retail operations were deemed to be inconsistent with the company s core operating strategies 
as of the end of fiscal year  seven of the ten stores had been closed  and the company expects to complete the exit plan by the end of the first quarter of lease cancellation penalty fees and related costs and asset write downs accrued and charged to expense amounted to million during and are included in restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
actual penalty fees or related costs paid and charged against the liability as of january  were million 
revenues and operating profits losses of the ten closed concessions stores amounted to million and thousand  respectively  in  million and million  respectively  in and million and million  respectively  in deferred tax assets the company has recognized net assets of million and million at january  and december   respectively  related to deferred taxes  which generally represent tax credit carryforwards and tax effects of future available deductions from taxable income 
prior to the distribution  the company was included in the host marriott corporation affiliated group the host marriott group for purposes of its federal income tax filings 
management believes that the realization of the net deferred tax assets recorded through the distribution date is more likely than not to occur because the host marriott group has deferred tax liabilities that must be paid in the future that are substantially in excess of the company s recognized net deferred tax assets 
upon consummation of the distribution  the company became a separate affiliated group for purposes of its federal income tax filings 
management has considered various factors as described below and believes that the company s recognized net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the net deferred tax assets are dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
during the period to  the company would have generated taxable and pretax book income in each year and cumulative taxable and pretax book income for this period of million and million  respectively  after adjusting for the pro forma effects of certain transfers related to the distribution and for unusual income and charges 
the relationship of pretax book income and taxable income is expected to continue indefinitely  with future originating temporary differences offsetting the reversal of existing temporary differences 
the company s deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences for property and equipment  accrued rent and reserves and to alternative minimum tax and general business tax credit carryforwards 
all of these items represent future reductions in the company s regular tax liabilities 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded at january  and december  management anticipates that increases in taxable income will arise in future periods primarily as a result of the business strategies discussed herein see business strategy and reduced operating costs resulting from the ongoing restructuring of the company s business processes 
the anticipated improvement in operating results is expected to increase the taxable income base to a level which would allow realization of the existing net deferred tax assets within nine to twelve years 
future levels of operating income and other taxable gains are dependent upon general economic and industry conditions  including airport and tollroad traffic  inflation  competition and demand for development of concepts  and other factors beyond the company s control  and no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of these tax credits and deductible temporary differences 
management has considered the above factors in reaching its conclusion that it is more likely than not that operating income will be sufficient to utilize these deferred deductions fully 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are not achieved 
stockholders deficit on december   one share of the company s common stock was distributed to the existing shareholders of host marriott for every five shares of host marriott stock held by those shareholders 
in connection with the distribution  million shares of the company s common stock were issued 
common shares outstanding increased from million as of the end of fiscal year to million as of the end of fiscal year this increase can be attributed to the issuance of million common shares of restricted stock to certain officers and key executives in and the issuance of million common shares in connection with the exercise of host marriott warrants in october see note 
the level of long term debt distributed to the company in connection with its spin off from host marriott was based on the company s ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to service the senior notes 
the company generated ebitda in excess of times cash interest expense in and times in both and the level of distributed long term debt resulted in the company reflecting a shareholders deficit of million and million as of january  and december   respectively 
inflation the company s expenses are impacted by inflation 
while price increases can be instituted as inflation occurs  many contracts require landlord approval before prices can be increased  which may temporarily adversely impact profit margins 
management believes that over time  however  the company will be able to raise prices and sustain profit margins
