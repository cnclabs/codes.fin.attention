item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three years ended december  general 
historically  the company s financial results have been significantly affected by the cyclical nature of the real estate industry 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future results 
for further information about certain factors which may affect future income and cash flow  see additional prospective information below 
community development operations 
community development land sales remained stable in and  at approximately  in each year 
however  in  land sales revenues decreased by compared to due primarily to the sale of a shopping center site in puerto rico in even though the sales revenue decreased in  the per acre commercial sales price in increased over prices 
these variations are due to the mix of commercial acres versus industrial and other business use land sales and the size and location of the property 
the average sales price of the residential lots sold in st 
charles has slowly decreased over the last three years as the remaining lots in the second village which are smaller and less desirable than the prime lots are sold 
the us residential lot sales volume has continued to be unfavorably impacted by the competitive market conditions 
excess new and resale home inventory levels throughout the industry have reduced the need for homebuilders to purchase additional lots 
the effect of this decline in us residential lot sales was offset by the addition of residential lot sales in puerto rico 
the gross profit margins for  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit margins in is due primarily to the change in the mix of sales discussed above 
commercial land sales produce the highest prices but require less development than the business park and residential land 
commercial sales as a percent of land sales revenue were  and for  and  respectively 
homebuilding operations 
revenues from home sales have continued to decline as the company phased out its tract homebuilding and competition increased 
the average sales price of the tract homes sold decreased and the sales price of the semi custom homes sold increased during as compared to the combined drop in the number of homes sold during compared to contributed to the decline in revenues 
during as compared to  the average sales prices increased a modest  but the decrease in the number of homes sold as a result of increased competition  geographical shift of market and changes in operations created the decrease in revenues during that period 
the gross profit margins were  and during  and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to is primarily due to the decrease in sales prices discussed above 
rental property revenues and operating results 
rental property revenues and operating expense include the results of operations of three consolidated apartment projects for the entire years  and and four additional partnerships for the period april  through december   the four partnerships consolidated in april became majority owned through acquisitions of additional limited partnership units 
equity in earnings from partnerships and developer fees 
equity in earnings from partnerships have fluctuated in the past three years due to distributions received from non consolidated partnerships that were either sold or refinanced 
in  the company received  of cash distributions when four properties were sold and in the company received  of cash distributions when a property was refinanced 
there were no similar transactions in management and other fees 
management and other fees increased in compared to this was due primarily to  of special management fees earned in from the lihprha transaction offset by the elimination of  of fees earned from the four partnerships consolidated as of april   a negotiated reduction of  per year effective june  on one of the management contracts  and  of additional deferred management fees that were recognized in management and other fees increased from to due to the recognition in income of reserves on fees earned from the management of certain apartment projects from a prior period but not determined to be collectible until interest expense 
interest expense decreased  during compared to and increased by  in compared to the decrease in was due to reduction of non rental property loan balances offset in part by the addition of four fully consolidated partnerships effective april  the increase in was due to higher interest rates and costs associated with obtaining new debt and refinancing existing debt 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  in compared to  and by  in compared to this is a result of management s continued focus on cost efficiency and the reduction of these expenses  as well as the recovery of stock appreciation rights expense in and due to a decline in the market price of the units 
liquidity and capital resources because of the terms of its debt agreements  substantially all of the cash generated by the company goes to pay down recourse debt  see item consolidated statements of cash flow  and as a result the company s liquidity is restricted 
the company has tax payments due in april for which it does not expect to remit timely payment in full 
in order to enhance its results of operations and cash flow  the company has refinanced certain assets  negotiated additional financings  reduced expenses and developed a restructuring plan 
in april  the company financed two substantially debt free apartment projects owned by non consolidated partnerships 
these financings provided the company approximately  which was utilized to meet debt obligations and other financial commitments 
the company negotiated a letter of intent for up to a  loan that will refinance substantially all of the us recourse bank debt 
this loan will also provide funds for past due trade payables  future development and working capital 
in addition  the release prices for land sales will be reduced under the new loan  resulting in increased cash available for operating needs 
in the event the  loan closing is delayed or does not occur  the company believes its ongoing operations  including asset sales and additional financings  will be sufficient to meet its existing debt  taxes and other operating obligations 
the company has development projects in various phases 
substantially all of the projects currently under construction have sufficient development loans in place to complete the construction 
the company intends to finance new construction with new development loans and working capital 
management is currently planning to restructure the company and simultaneously raise new capital  the proceeds of which would be used to pay down the company s community development bank debt and provide working capital for ongoing community development needs 
management hopes to accomplish this restructuring  discussed further herewith in note  during additional prospective information the following discussion contains statements that may be considered forward looking that involve a number of risks and uncertainties as discussed herein and in the company s sec reports 
therefore  actual results could differ materially 
the real estate industry is cyclical  and is especially sensitive to fluctuations in economic activity and movements in interest rates 
residential lot sales and sales of new homes are affected by market conditions for rental properties and by the condition of the resale market for used homes  including foreclosed homes in certain cities as well as the competitive supply of other new homes for sale 
an oversupply of rental real estate depresses rents and reduces incentives for renters to purchase homes 
an oversupply of resale units depresses prices and reduces the margins available to builders on sales of new homes 
in addition  the slowing of the economy and its impact on consumer spending  particularly in overbuilt markets  can adversely impact both commercial and residential development activity  including the demand for housing 
the company s homebuilding and community development sales continue to be greatly influenced by consumer confidence  housing demand  prevailing market interest rates  movements in such rates and expectations about future rates 
even though the rates have remained fairly stable and an adequate supply is available to the entry level homebuyer  the economic uncertainties associated with the federal budget and government furloughs during and came at a time when supplies and competition were high in the washington  dc market 
as a result  the area s inventory remains high and profit margins continue to decline 
the housing markets in st 
mary s and charles county are anticipated to be favorably impacted by the expansion of the patuxent river naval air warfare center in st 
mary s county 
this expansion is expected to generate  jobs in st 
mary s county within the next few years 
management anticipates the light industrial and business park land sales to increase after the absorption of the excess inventory in the region 
currently  the company has seen increased interest in its us commercial land 
the puerto rico residential and commercial market has remained stable 
traditionally  the company has realized the value of its land assets by selling parcels in fee simple transactions  by taking back notes or through option agreements on residential lots in which lot prices escalate at predetermined rates 
on occasion  it also has participated in joint ventures by contributing land at its appraised value in exchange for a combination of cash at settlement and or a percentage of the partnership s cash flow 
as a result of its restructuring as disclosed above in liquidity and capital resources  the company may find joint ventures as the best strategy to maximize long term returns  especially on its commercial land
