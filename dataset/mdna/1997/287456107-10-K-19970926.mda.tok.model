selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were for fiscal compared to in fiscal during fiscal  the company established a larger sales organization to better serve growing market areas 
this larger organization has been able to service a significant increase in sales orders without a proportionate increase in overall selling costs 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated cash flows from operating activities of  in fiscal  despite an  increase in working capital in fiscal the significant increase in working capital was primarily the result of higher inventories  which increased  during fiscal the majority of this increase related to finished goods inventories which were increased at all roofing plants in anticipation of higher demand during the summer and fall months 
receivables increased  during the year primarily as a result of higher sales generated during fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in deferred payment term receivables 
at june   deferred payment term receivables from promotional programs to certain customers were  compared to  in receivables from these programs at june  deferred receivables outstanding at june   are primarily due during the first quarter of fiscal the current ratio at june   was to compared to to at june  historically  working capital requirements and associated borrowings fluctuate during the year because of seasonality in some market areas 
generally  working capital requirements and borrowings are higher in the spring and summer months  and lower in the fall and winter months 
the company used  for investing activities in fiscal the majority of these expenditures were for capital expenditures and related deferred start up costs incurred in connection with the completion of a new plant at the company s ennis  texas facility to manufacture nonwoven fiberglass roofing mat and industrial facer products for the construction industry 
during fiscal  the company completed its three year major new facilities expansion program 
capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of  to  in fiscal the majority of currently planned capital expenditures are for productivity  capacity and cost improvement projects at the three current roofing plants 
in addition  the company anticipates an expansion of capacity in chromium corporation s conductive coatings division in order to meet growing demand for its compushield process for conductive coatings of plastic enclosures for electronic equipment 
cash flows used for financing activities were  in fiscal  primarily resulting from the payment of dividends and a  decrease in long term debt at june  long term debt represented only of the  of invested capital long term debt plus shareholders equity at june  in october  the company increased its unsecured revolving line of credit from  to  and extended the term to october  as of june    was available under this facility 
the company s board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to  of the company s common shares from time to time on the open market to be used for general corporate purposes 
as of june    shares with cumulative cost of  had been repurchased under this program 
in september  the board of directors reinstated the company s regular quarterly cash dividend 
in september  the regular quarterly cash dividend was increased by to seven cents per common share 
the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
although the company does not believe it will be required to expend amounts which will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations by reason of environmental laws and regulations  such laws and regulations are frequently changed and could result in significantly increased cost of compliance 
further  certain of the company s industrial products operations utilize hazardous materials in their production process 
as a result  the company incurs costs for remediation activities off site and at its facilities from time to time 
the company established and maintains reserves for remediation activities  when appropriate  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
current reserves established for known or probable remediation activities are not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
management believes that current cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and its unsecured revolving credit facility should be sufficient during fiscal and beyond to fund its planned capital expenditures  working capital needs  dividends  stock repurchases and other cash requirements 
management also believes its revolving credit facility could be amended to provide additional cash resources 
pending accounting pronouncement the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants has issued an exposure draft on reporting on the costs of start up activities 
if the exposure draft were to be finalized in its proposed form  it would require companies to expense previously capitalized start up costs 
at june   the company had  of unamortized capitalized start up costs 
while the company does not agree with the accounting treatment proposed in the acsec exposure draft and believes that capitalizing costs incurred in constructing major new facilities provides a better matching of revenues and expenses  the company will adopt this statement of position if and when it is finalized 
forward looking statements in an effort to give investors a well rounded view of the company s current condition and future opportunities  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements about its prospects for the future 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the following the company s roofing products business is cyclical and is affected by weather and some of the same economic factors that affect the housing and home improvement industries generally  including interest rates  the availability of financing and general economic conditions 
in addition  the asphalt roofing products manufacturing business is highly competitive 
actions of competitors  including changes in pricing  or slowing demand for asphalt roofing products due to general or industry economic conditions or the amount of inclement weather could result in decreased demand for the company s products  lower prices received or reduced utilization of plant facilities 
in the asphalt roofing products business  the significant raw materials are ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins and mineral filler 
increased costs of raw materials can result in reduced margins  as can higher trucking and rail costs 
historically  the company has been able to pass some of the higher raw material and transportation costs through to the customer 
should the company be unable to recover higher raw material and transportation costs from price increases of its products  operating results could be lower than projected 
during fiscal  the company completed a three year million expansion program which included a new roofing plant in shafter  california and the construction of a new plant at the company s ennis  texas facility to manufacture nonwoven fiberglass roofing mats and other mats for a variety of industrial uses 
as new facilities  their progress in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies and financial results is difficult to predict 
if such progress is slower than anticipated  or if demand for products produced at either of these new plants does not meet current expectations  operating results could be adversely affected 
certain facilities of the company s industrial products subsidiaries must utilize hazardous materials in their production process 
as a result  the company could incur costs for remediation activities at its facilities or off site  and other related exposures from time to time in excess of established reserves for such activities 
the company s litigation  including its patent infringement suits against gaf  is subject to inherent and case specific uncertainty 
the outcome of such litigation depends on numerous interrelated factors  many of which cannot be predicted 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking beliefs or judgments in making investment decisions
