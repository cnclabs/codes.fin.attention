item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in  the company had a loss of  in the later part of  the company made a decision to expand its environmental operations by opening an office in san marcos  texas and then in early another office in salt lake city  utah 
in hindsight  those decisions proved to be unproductive and poorly timed 
the company s texas operation has lost money and the company has made the decision to reduce the size of that office 
a few technical people remain to monitor existing clients ongoing needs 
in addition  the salt lake city office has been reorganized and streamlined 
it is anticipated that the  in losses annually from the texas operation will cease immediately and that the cost of the salt lake city office will be decreased by nearly netting an additional  in savings 
in addition  there has been an industry wide reduction in demand for environmental engineering services 
the company has been forced to make the decision to retain highly trained technical staff through this slowdown time in order to provide services for our ongoing clients and to be competitive in this technical market 
it is our belief that this decrease in demand for services was based on industry wide wait and see attitude about the national election 
many clients of both ours and our competitors delayed or postponed environmental service work throughout consequently  revenues for the year are down  in the volume of revenue seemed sufficient to continue our experiments with the branch offices 
in  a very quick decline in revenues has generated substantial losses 
the company purchased approximately  of property and equipment in as compared to  in it is not anticipated that these purchases will be repeated in or and the utilization of cash proceeds will not be depleted with future purchases 
the company continues to attempt to sell its facilities on wn road in casper and has leased one half of those facilities that amounts approximately equal to the debt service on the building 
as of the writing of this report an offer has been received on the shop and warehouse for  the offer is contingent upon the buyer obtaining a satisfactory financing 
property values have escalated substantially in the san marcos austin area and it is anticipated that the texas property will continue to increase in value 
parts of the building have been leased to tenants to minimize the carrying costs of that building 
the sale of either of the casper properties or the san marcos property would have a significant positive impact on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
the following information is provided for the years ending december  and working capital   long term debt to equity cash provided utilized by operations   cash and short term investments available   in addition  in late the company purchased acres of undeveloped commercial real estate in casper  wyoming 
the land is adjacent to and fronts interstate and is dissected by east second street the main business thoroughfare in casper 
the land was purchased for less than cents per square foot 
there is no announced time table for development of the land 
management believes that the carrying value of producing oil and gas properties is not in excess of the future revenues which will be recovered 
carrying value of producing properties  net of depletion is  oil and gas revenues  net of expenses were  for the year 
as many of the company s producing properties are natural gas properties with lives in excess of twenty five years  we believe the carrying value of the assets is fully recoverable 
in addition  the company has participated in drilling development wells in the brundage canyon area 
we have experienced significant success for our company  and expect oil and gas revenues to increase to nearly  in in addition  the company has carrying value of  on nonproducing properties which is net of an allowance for impairment of  management believes the allowance is adequate and the remaining costs in the assets will be recovered 
management knows of no environmental assessment problems nor of the potential of any such environmental assessment 
all purchased real estate has had environmental studies done prior to purchase and both our printing operation and our environmental lab have been instructed on the appropriate procedures for disposals of various kinds of waste 
such wastes although relatively insignificant in amount are tested prior to disposal as part of an environmental assurance program 
results of operations this summarization of the results of operations will not include the activities of the discontinued operations 
the reader is referred to the section above entitled liquidity and capital resources and to footnote no 
of the consolidated financial statements 
environmental revenues increased from  to  between and primarily due to the company s ability to acquire several large clients in with the completion of those jobs and with a general turn down in the demand for environmental services as described in the preceding section  environmental revenues decreased from  to  in environmental expenses showed a proportional increase from to  but in the expense did not decrease proportionally with the dramatic decrease in revenues 
the reason for this is the company s inability to decrease its trained staff without jeopardizing its ability to compete in the market 
consequently  anytime when there is a short term rapid decline in demand for services  the company s carrying costs of technical staff will generate losses for that period 
as described above  the size of the company s staff has been decreased in its texas and salt lake city offices to partially compensate for these declines 
for the first three months in  revenues and expenses are approximately equal in the company s environmental business 
oil and gas sales increased from  in to  in and showed a slight decline to  in however  oil and gas expense  although increasing from  to  in  decreased by  to  for the year this decline reflects the company s acquisition of certain producing overriding royalties as compared to the bulk of the sales being from more expensive properties in prior years 
depreciation  depletion and amortization were  in as compared to  in and  in the increase in depreciation reflects the depreciation on the increased assets purchased during general and administrative costs were  in and increased to  in and again to  in this increase in overhead costs reflects an increased number of staff in and early interest expense was  in slightly increased to  in  reflecting an increased borrowing base and declining to  in  reflecting the repayment of long term debt 
interest income increased from  in to  in  indicative of an increased amount of investment funds from the sale of the publishing businesses and has declined to  in  reflecting the utilization of some of those funds 
provisions for income tax in reflect the amount of current income taxes payable 
no provision has been made for deferred taxes in   or management believes that although disclosures mandated by sfas no 
are generally informative  that in the company s case the application of sfas no 
leads to disclosures which are confusing 
to comply with sfas no 
is to record deferred income tax expense on the books of the company  when in fact  the company has over  of net operating loss carryforwards  over  of depletion carryforwards and over  of various income tax credits 
this issue is derived from the application of the provisions of sfas no 
to companies who have had quasi reorganizations in the past 
hawks industries applied the quasi reorganization provisions arb  effective in specifically  paragraphs and of sfas no 
require that in cases where there has been a quasi reorganization  that the tax benefits of loss carryforwards and credits  earned prior to the date of the quasi reorganization  be ignored when calculating deferred income tax benefits 
although management believes that such obscure provisions may give rise to great fodder in the world of academia  we believe that to apply the principles of sfas no 
 paragraphs and  is at variance with the economic realities of the present case 
accordingly  we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 
 paragraphs and it is management s intent to attempt to reflect the economic reality of our present tax situation 
given all of the future tax benefits which will be available to the company to offset future net income  management believes that the financial statements presented have accomplished our goal
