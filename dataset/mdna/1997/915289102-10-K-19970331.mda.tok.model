unocal completed the sale of its california oil and gas properties and entered into agreements to sell its west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets 
the results of operations for the west coast refining  marketing and transportation segment are presented as discontinued operations 
management s discussion and analysis continued unocal s adjusted after tax earnings from continuing operations reflected higher average sales prices for worldwide crude oil and condensate and for natural gas  increased foreign natural gas production  and increased production and sales volumes for agricultural products 
partially offsetting these positive factors were lower worldwide crude oil production and lower agricultural products sales prices 
vs during  adjusted after tax earnings from continuing operations reflected higher worldwide average crude oil sales prices and higher average sales prices for agricultural products 
partially offsetting these positive factors were lower production for worldwide crude oil and geothermal steam and lower average sales prices for natural gas 
other special items from continuing operations in the preceding table  the other category of special items from continuing operations for primarily consisted of a million restructuring provision and a million receivable write down 
for  the category included a million benefit from a bankruptcy settlement with columbia gas transmission corporation  an million charge for a deferred tax adjustment and a million receivable write down 
for  the amount consisted primarily of a million restructuring provision and a million benefit related to the lease cancellation on the former unocal headquarters building in downtown los angeles 
revenues total revenues from continuing operations were billion in  billion in and billion in the increase in from was primarily due to higher worldwide crude oil and natural gas sales prices and increased natural gas production and agricultural products sales volumes 
the increase in from was largely due to higher agricultural products average sales prices and gains on sales of assets

comparing years and to  the company s continued cost reduction efforts resulted in an average decrease of percent in selling  administrative and general costs 
in  dry hole costs were higher primarily due to increased exploratory drilling in the united states 
reduced worldwide exploratory drilling in resulted in lower dry hole costs 
during  the company reduced interest expense as a result of paying down debt 
the company s interest expense was higher by six percent in due principally to increased borrowing to fund the capital program

during  this business segment reported a percent increase in adjusted after tax earnings primarily due to strong worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices  higher foreign natural gas production and increased demand for fuel during the winter months 
vs increases in the average worldwide sales price for crude oil and condensate contributed significantly to improved earnings 
the average worldwide sales price for crude oil and condensate increased per barrel or management s discussion and analysis continued percent and the average worldwide sales price for natural gas increased 
per mcf or percent above the levels 
in  foreign natural gas production increased percent  principally due to improved production levels in thailand  indonesia and the netherlands 
worldwide crude oil production averaged  barrels per day compared to  in this decrease of percent was primarily due to lower domestic production resulting from the sale of california oil and gas properties and natural production declines 
vs during  the company experienced lower worldwide crude oil production and lower average domestic natural gas sales prices 
worldwide crude oil production in averaged  barrels per day compared to  in the decrease was mainly due to natural production declines and the sale of domestic properties 
geothermal operations this business segment explores for  and produces and sells geothermal resources used to generate electricity 
millions of dollars after tax earnings loss special items impairment of long lived assets asset sales other total special items after tax earnings excluding special items vs during  the company experienced higher development  exploratory and dry hole expenses principally in indonesia 
in addition  earnings were adversely impacted due to a contract dispute between the philippine geothermal  inc subsidiary and the philippine national power corporation 
partially offsetting these negative factors were a percent increase in steam generation  primarily due to the use of discount pricing at the geysers in northern california and electrical generation expansion at mak ban in the philippines 
vs the decrease in adjusted after tax earnings was the result of lower steam production at the geysers in northern california and at the tiwi facilities in the philippines 
the lower production at the geysers was due to seven months of discretionary curtailments by the public utility company that purchases the steam to generate electricity 
the lower production at the tiwi facilities was due to typhoon damage sustained in these negative factors were partially offset by increased production and prices for indonesian operations 
the increased production resulted from a full year of supplying steam from the gunung salak field to operate two megawatt power generating plants 
diversified business group the agricultural products business unit manufactures and markets nitrogen based products for wholesale agricultural and industrial markets supplying the western united states and the pacific rim 
the carbon and minerals business unit produces and markets petroleum coke  graphites  solvents and specialty minerals

in addition  maintenance expenses were lower in than in the higher expenses were the result of the finley plant start up and scheduled maintenance at the kenai  alaska ammonia plant 
partially offsetting these positive factors were lower sales prices for ammonia and urea 
during  the carbon and minerals business unit s adjusted after tax earnings decreased principally due to higher mining expenses and lower solvent margins 
the increased mining expenses were primarily the result of the start up of the questa molybdenum mine 
vs in  the agricultural products business unit benefited from significant increases in ammonia and urea product sales prices because of higher demand in international markets 
this was partially offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs  due to the start up expenses associated with the finley plant  and scheduled maintenance at the kenai plant 
in  the carbon and minerals business unit benefited from higher petroleum coke and lanthanide earnings 
corporate and unallocated corporate expense includes general corporate overhead  the new ventures group and other unallocated costs 
net interest expense represents interest expense  net of interest income and capitalized interest 
the new ventures group pursues foreign business development opportunities 
during  the new ventures group s infrastructure projects included proposed oil and gas pipelines from turkmenistan to pakistan  an equity joint venture in zhangjiagang  china to construct a liquefied petroleum gas terminal  and the acquisition of a percent interest in the transandean oil pipeline

cash flow from operating activities  including discontinued operations and working capital and other changes  was  million in   million in and  million in the amount reflects higher commodity prices and increased natural gas production and agricultural products sales 
these benefits were partially offset by increased working capital requirements 
cash flow from operating activities for included million of proceeds from the sale of trade receivables see note  million from the columbia gas settlement and million for the settlement of federal leases 
these benefits were more than offset by temporary working capital changes 
the operating cash flow reflected decreased working capital requirements and significant income tax refunds received during the year 
these benefits were partially offset by lower operational earnings 
during  the company generated million in pre tax proceeds from sales of assets 
the amount included million in proceeds from the sale of california oil and gas properties  million from the sale of management s discussion and analysis continued geothermal assets  and million from the sale of exploration blocks in the north sea 
proceeds from asset sales in amounted to million  primarily from the sale of miscellaneous oil and gas properties and the company s process  technology and licensing business 
proceeds from sales of assets in totaled million  principally from the sale of oil and gas properties 
in and  the company also generated approximately million and million  respectively  in cash from the sale of its common stock  primarily through the exercise of employee stock options and the dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
in september  the company exchanged  new percent trust convertible preferred securities of unocal capital trust for  shares of unocal s outstanding convertible preferred stock 
on september   the company called the  unexchanged shares of convertible preferred stock for redemption 
all of the unexchanged shares of preferred stock were converted into unocal common stock by the october  redemption date see note 
the company s total debt at year end decreased million from year end  to  million 
the decrease was primarily due to retirement of a million swiss franc bond issue and a reduction of commercial paper borrowings 
funding for debt retirements primarily consisted of proceeds from asset sales 
for  the company expects cash generated from operational earnings and asset sales to be adequate to meet its operating requirements  capital spending and dividend payments 
the company expects to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets to reduce debt by approximately million and to repurchase up to million of common stock 
in addition  the company has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements 
at december   the company had approximately billion of undrawn commitments under various credit facilities with major banks 
the company s foreign operations have limited exposures to foreign currency risks 
in most countries  energy products are valued and sold in us dollars  and foreign currency operating cost exposures have not been significant 
in the philippines and thailand  the company is paid for product deliveries in the local currencies  but at prices indexed to us dollar valuations 
such funds  less amounts required for local currency denominated obligations  are converted to us dollars as soon as practicable and periodically remitted to the us parent 
the company s canadian subsidiary is paid in canadian dollars for its crude oil and natural gas sales 
excess canadian funds generally have been invested in other unocal foreign operations rather than remitted to the us parent 
the company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments 
the majority are debt related and are used to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company also uses futures contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in petroleum commodity prices 
at year end such contracts covered less than one percent of the company s annual oil and gas production 
capital expenditures for continuing operations estimated millions of dollars exploration and production domestic foreign total  geothermal operations diversified business group agricultural products carbon and minerals pipelines corporate and unallocated new ventures other total    management s discussion and analysis continued capital spending in on foreign oil and gas exploration and production increased percent from reflecting increased expenditures in thailand  indonesia  myanmar  and azerbaijan 
capital spending on geothermal energy projects in primarily focused on development work at the salak field on the island of java and exploration drilling on the island of sumatra  in indonesia 
capital spending in will focus on the development of overseas oil  gas and geothermal projects  particularly in myanmar  thailand  indonesia and azerbaijan 
the sale of the west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets will enable the company to shift capital spending to higher return projects  with percent of total planned capital spending directed to asian projects 
in  the foreign exploration and production group s capital spending plan will increase percent from the level 
a major focus of this spending will be the yadana field development offshore myanmar and the related pipeline project 
this natural gas project is expected to be in operation by mid in thailand  the company plans to develop the plamuk gas field  discovered in  and extend development of its existing fields to increase natural gas production when a second pipeline to shore and related facilities become fully operational in the second quarter of in indonesia  the company plans to further develop new oil and gas reserves offshore east kalimantan and to accelerate its successful exploratory drilling program by drilling exploratory wells in known producing basins during other important projects are in the caspian sea  offshore azerbaijan 
unocal is a member of two international consortia that are moving forward with development programs in this oil rich area 
the united states lower accounts for percent of the domestic capital budget  as the company s new business unit  spirit energy  focuses on development of key natural gas projects 
the capital expenditures for the geothermal operations segment are expected to approximate the level  focusing on projects in indonesia 
the company expects to accelerate development of resource production facilities at the salak field and to conduct additional exploration at the sarulla contract area on the island of sumatra 
the company has a percent interest in a joint venture that is building and will operate three power plants at the salak field that will utilize its steam production 
the decrease in the agricultural products business unit s capital spending in reflects reduced expenditures due to the startup of the finley  washington ammonia manufacturing plant in the planned increase in capital spending for the carbon and minerals business unit in is due to capital requirements for its lanthanides operations in mountain pass  california 
the pipelines business unit s capital expenditures in included miscellaneous upgrades to existing facilities and acquisition of a percent interest in the transandean oil pipeline  which transports crude oil from argentina to chile 
environmental matters the company continues to incur substantial capital and operating expenditures for environmental protection and to comply with federal  state and local laws and provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
in many cases  investigatory or remedial work is now required at various sites even though past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under environmental laws and regulations  if any  existing at the time 
management s discussion and analysis continued estimated millions of dollars environment related capital expenditures continuing operations discontinued operations environment related capital expenditures include additions and modifications to company facilities to mitigate and or eliminate emissions and waste generation 
most of these capital expenditures are required to comply with federal  state and local laws and regulations 
the decrease in capital expenditures for discontinued operations reflects the completion of major modifications to the company s refineries to manufacture cleaner burning reformulated gasoline for the california market 
these modifications were performed between and at a cost of approximately million 
amounts charged to earnings for environment related expense were million in  million in and million in environmental expenses include remediation costs and operating  maintenance and administrative costs related to environmental compliance 
these expenses include provisions for future remediation costs that were identified during the company s on going review of its environmental obligations 
in  these provisions consisted primarily of remediation costs for active company facilities  the guadalupe oil field  the avila beach site and sold california oil and gas properties 
the provisions for these sites are discussed in more detail below 
at december   the company s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled million  of which million was included in other current liabilities 
the total amount is grouped into the following five categories year end millions of dollars superfund and similar sites former company operated sites company facilities sold with retained liabilities inactive or closed company facilities active company facilities total reserves superfund and similar sites at year end  unocal received notification from the us environmental protection agency that the company may be a potentially responsible party prp at sites and may share certain liabilities at these sites 
in addition  various state agencies and private parties had identified other similar prp sites that may require investigation and remediation 
of the total  the company has denied responsibility at five sites and at another eight sites the company s liability  although unquantified  appears to be de minimis 
the total also includes sites which are under investigation or in litigation  for which the company s potential liability is not presently determinable 
at another four sites  the company has made settlement payments and is in the final process of resolving its liabilities 
of the remaining sites  where probable costs can be estimated  reserves of million have been established for future remediation and settlement costs 
these sites exclude sites where the company s liability has been settled  or where the company has both no evidence of liability and there has been no further indication of liability by government agencies or third parties for at least a month period 
unocal does not consider the number of sites for which it has been named a prp as a relevant measure of liability 
although the liability of a prp is generally joint and several  the company is usually just one of several companies designated as a prp 
the company s ultimate share of the remediation costs at those sites often is not management s discussion and analysis continued determinable due to many unknown factors as discussed in note the solvency of other responsible parties and disputes regarding responsibilities may also impact the company s ultimate costs 
former company operated sites reserves of million have been established for this category of sites 
of the total  million was for approximately service station sites on leased properties at which operations have ceased and which the company is obligated to remediate before returning them to the owners 
also included was million for approximately service station sites that the company previously owned or leased 
the current owners of such properties are holding the company responsible for environmental remediation costs 
company facilities sold with retained liabilities this category has reserves of million for environmental liabilities related to former company businesses and assets that have been sold 
included are the company s former auto truckstop facilities  a former mine site in wyoming  industrial chemical and polymer sites and agricultural chemical sites 
facilities which were transferred to the uno ven company in in connection with its formation are also in this category 
in each sale  the company retained a contractual remediation or indemnification obligation and is responsible only for certain environmental problems associated with its past operations 
the reserves represent presently estimated future costs for investigation feasibility studies and identified remediation work as a result of claims made by buyers of the properties 
also included in this category are the company s california oil and gas properties and facilities sold in april under the sale agreement the company retained certain environmental liabilities for some of the properties sold 
during the course of the sale  the company also identified environmental liabilities for certain properties that were ultimately excluded from the sale 
as a result  in the company added million to the reserve for estimated future assessment and remediation costs 
additional related costs may be incurred but cannot be determined until further assessments and investigations of the properties are performed 
inactive or closed company facilities reserves of million have been established for these types of facilities 
the major sites in this category are the guadalupe oil field on the central california coast and the avila beach  california site 
also included in this category are the former beaumont refinery in texas  the shale oil project and a chemical facility in colorado 
the guadalupe oil field reserve includes estimated costs for the cleanup of underground releases of a diesel like additive that was formerly used to produce the field s heavy crude oil 
during  million was added to the reserve for estimated assessment and remediation expenses  including implementation of a preliminary draft remedial action plan submitted to the regional water quality control board and the county of san luis obispo 
also included are costs to complete an environmental impact report and for additional studies and investigations 
the company expects to incur additional  but currently indeterminate  expenses for this site 
also included in this category is the avila beach  california  site 
in  petroleum hydrocarbon contamination was discovered under the front street section of the town 
it was determined that the source of the contamination had been leaking pipelines that ran between a tank farm and wharf operated by the company 
during  the company added million to the reserve  primarily for the estimated implementation costs associated with remedial action plans submitted to the regional water quality control board and the county of san luis obispo for the cleanup of the beach and town areas of the site 
the reserve also includes estimated expenses for the completion of an environmental impact report 
the company expects to incur additional  but currently indeterminate  expenses for this site 
active company facilities the company has provided million for estimated future costs of remedial orders  corrective actions and other investigation  remediation and monitoring obligations at certain operating facilities and producing oil and gas fields 
also included in this category is the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico which resumed operations in management s discussion and analysis continued in  the company added million to the reserve for active facilities  primarily for service stations 
some of the remediation is being performed as the company replaces underground storage tank ust systems at these sites 
federal regulations require all ust systems to meet new standards by december the additional reserve also includes remediation to be performed in conjunction with the company s program to upgrade its service stations 
the agreement for the sale of the company s west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets specifies that the company will share in a portion of environmental liabilities arising from operation of the assets prior to the closing of the sale 
the company s liability for environmental costs will expire years after the closing date 
in addition to the costs for service stations described above  the company has accrued its estimate of the probable future costs for known environmental liabilities related to the other assets to be sold 
the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
under these laws  the company is subject to possible obligations to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of certain chemical and petroleum substances at various sites 
corrective investigations and actions pursuant to rcra are being performed at the company s san francisco and los angeles refineries  the beaumont facility  and at the company s closed shale oil project  and washington  pennsylvania facility 
the company also must provide financial assurance for future closure and post closure costs of its rcra permitted facilities 
because these costs will be incurred at different times and over a period of many years  the company believes that these obligations are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the total environmental remediation reserves recorded on the consolidated balance sheet represent the company s estimates of assessment and remediation costs based on currently available facts  existing technology  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
the remediation cost estimates  in many cases  are based on plans recommended to the regulatory agencies for approval and are subject to future revisions 
the ultimate costs to be incurred will likely exceed the total amounts reserved  since many of the sites are relatively early in the remedial investigation or feasibility study phases 
additional liabilities may be accrued as the assessment work is completed and formal remedial plans are formulated 
the company has estimated  to the extent that it was able to do so  that it could incur approximately million of additional costs in excess of the million accrued at december  the amount of such possible additional costs reflects  in most cases  the high end of the range of costs of feasible alternatives identified by the company for those sites with respect to which investigation or feasibility studies have advanced to the stage of analyzing such alternatives 
however  such estimated possible additional costs are not an estimate of the total remediation costs beyond the amounts reserved  since at a large number of sites the company is not yet in a position to estimate any possible additional costs 
both the amounts reserved and estimates of possible additional costs may change in the near term  in some cases  substantially  as additional information becomes available regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  required or agreed upon remediation methods  and other actions by government agencies and private parties
