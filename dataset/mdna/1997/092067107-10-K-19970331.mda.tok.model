additionally  throughout the company expended funds on development efforts required for the jacobs project 
as the company expends funds on other projects  particularly the jacobs project see below  interest income will continue to decline 
other components of the company s revenue  which declined in the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year  were management fees and rental income 
management fee income is computed based upon of the defined volume of the various departments of the casino s operations reduced by defined expenses 
usually as the volume of business of ghv increases or decreases  the management fee earned by the company will fluctuate accordingly 
however  as costs and expenses of the casino for the year ended declined by approximately management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont

the other principal revenue account of the company is the parking fees it receives from ghv for the use of millsites   and  during on an as needed basis  millsite  as parking for the patrons of the casino 
in november  the company agreed to allow the use of millsite for parking  on a trial basis  for a monthly charge of  to determine if the additional parking on millsite was warranted 
ghv utilized millsite during january and february  however  as the company started conducting pre development work on millsite during march  parking has not been available on millsite since that time 
additionally  the business improvement district s bid efforts in the city during caused the company to lose some parking on millsite due to the temporary rerouting of main street onto the company s property 
accordingly  the amount the company charged the casino was reduced by the number of spaces lost to the city for the construction on main street 
the company has not committed to any long term parking arrangements for the use of millsites  and with the casino due to the development efforts currently underway with the jacobs project see discussion below 
costs and expenses total compensation and related costs increased for the year ended december  by approximately  due principally to a negotiated severance package with the company s former general manager of the casino of  compensation for the company s new ceo for one month of  a marketing consultancy agreement of approximately  and other increases of  other general and administrative costs declined by approximately  and interest costs declined by  for an overall decrease in costs and expenses from recurring operations of approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable year of during late and the company incurred approximately  in costs in attempting to secure a gaming concession in mexico 
the company deferred writing off these costs until it became known that the possibility of securing a mexican gaming license was not practical or on the horizon 
the mexican legislature was rumored to be set to approve gaming within mexico at several times during  however this did not occur 
in the fourth quarter of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont 
 the mexican legislature deferred any further decision making until sometime in or later 
the company chose to write these costs off during the fourth quarter of as it does not presently appear that any meaningful value will be realized from these costs in the foreseeable future 
see also item certain relationships and related transactions 
additionally  during the year ended december  the company wrote off the costs of its patented table game known as prospector jackpot poker 
the company incurred approximately  of costs in developing  patenting and test marketing this game during the past two years 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company was unable to secure any approvals for test marketing the game in mississippi as it had previously hoped 
additionally  the company obtained approval for the game in colorado and conducted live play at the casino to determine if a market existed for the game in colorado 
the results of that effort led the company to conclude that the present market for this table game is very limited and accordingly it wrote these costs off during the fourth quarter of the company  may in the future attempt to re introduce the game in new and emerging markets if that opportunity should present itself  however no assurance can be given in this regard 
equity in earnings of gilpin hotel joint venture ghv by virtue of the company s ownership of ghv  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to record its share of the net earnings of ghv  after elimination of intercompany transactions and other adjustments  as equity in earnings of joint venture 
although the company receives other revenue from ghv  as discussed above  equity in earnings of joint venture accounts for substantially all of the company s income before income taxes

general and administrative costs have risen due to the company s increased level of activity as it seeks diversification to other markets 
interest costs are higher than the prior year due to a higher level of debt  resulting primarily from the acquisition of millsite in late december additionally  the company acquired millsite  which was partially financed by  of seller debt  in the third quarter of equity in earnings of joint venture while the casino s total revenues declined only slightly by  the complimentary promotional allowances incurred during as compared to declined by  hence  the casino s net revenues for show an increase of  as compared to the costs and expenses rose by approximately  or  which when combined with the net increase in the net revenues of the casino of  referred to above  accounts for the decline in net income  as compared to  of approximately  or in the opinion of the company  the most significant reason for the increase in the total costs and expenses of the ghv  was the changing environment and the high level of competition within the black hawk central city gaming districts

the third quarter of represented the first quarter for the opening of a plus gaming device casino next door to the gilpin 
the addition of these new facilities  as well as the overall competitiveness within the market place  resulted in ghv incurring higher costs for labor  marketing and operations 
additionally  competitors continued to expand their promotional packages  increase their parking availability and or construct new parking facilities in an effort to compete for ghv s customers 
ghv responded to these marketing challenges through the development of its own marketing strategies and the implementation of new and more aggressive programs as well as hiring additional personnel to improve customer service

the incremental costs of additional personnel to coordinate  manage and operate efforts such as weekly slot machine tournaments did not provide meaningful benefits to revenues 
additionally  early in ghv completed combining the gilpin hotel casino with the pick a dilly casino  which was purchased in november in connection therewith  ghv continued employment of many former pick a dilly employees through the first quarter of  in anticipation of increased activity resulting from the combined structures 
this  however  did not occur and accounts for some of the increase in the payroll costs for over other increased costs during included charges for depreciation and amortization of  due to the acquisition of the pick a dilly casino  interest expense of  due to the debt incurred to acquire the pick a dilly casino  an increase of  in device fees paid to the city of black hawk as a result of approximately additional machines utilized in the pick a dilly casino  utility costs of  property taxes of  parking fees of  legal and licensing costs of  property and casualty insurance of  and an increase in all other costs of approximately  while many costs of ghv increased  ghv realized significant decreases in some costs during compared to specifically  slot rental expenses were reduced by  due to the paid up status of most of ghv s slot machine leases

ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
due to the company s method of accounting for its equity ownership in the ghv  several adjustments are necessary to arrive at ebitda for the company 
the above table  after giving effect to these adjustments  indicate a decline in the company s ebitda during the current year of approximately  as compared to generally  the decline in the current year ebitda is attributable to a decrease in equity of earnings of ghv  excluding the portion of decrease attributable to depreciation and interest 
the impact of ghv s operating results on ebitda was partially offset by a decline in the amount of federal and state income taxes due to a lower amount of taxable income realized in the current year
