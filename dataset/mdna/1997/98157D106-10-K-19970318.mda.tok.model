item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended december  after giving effect to the idb merger  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document 
general the company s emphasis on acquisitions has taken the company from a small regional long distance carrier to one of the largest long distance telecommunications companies in the industry  serving customers domestically and internationally 
the company s operations have grown significantly in each year of its operations as a result of internal growth  the selective acquisition of smaller long distance companies with limited geographic service areas and market shares  the consolidation of certain third tier long distance carriers with larger market shares  and international expansion 
as a result of the mfs merger on december   each share of mfs common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of worldcom common stock or approximately million worldcom common shares in the aggregate 
each share of mfs series a preferred stock was converted into the right to receive one share of worldcom series a preferred stock or  shares in the aggregate 
each share of mfs series b convertible preferred stock was converted into the right to receive one share of worldcom series b convertible preferred stock or approximately million shares in the aggregate 
in addition  each depositary share representing th of a share of mfs series a preferred stock was exchanged for a depositary share representing th of a share of worldcom series a preferred stock 
upon effectiveness of the mfs merger  the then outstanding and unexercised options and warrants exercisable for shares of mfs common stock were converted into options and warrants  respectively  exercisable for shares of common stock having substantially the same terms and conditions as the mfs options and warrants  except that i the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise were divided and multiplied  respectively  by and ii the holders of each then outstanding and unexercised mfs shareworks plus award granted under the mfs stock plan instead received the cash value of such option in accordance with the terms of such plan 
mfs provides telecommunications services and systems for business and government customers 
mfs is a leading provider of alternative local network access facilities via digital fiber optic cable networks that it has installed in and around approximately united states cities  and in several major european cities 
mfs also provides domestic and international long distance telecommunications services via its network platform  which consists of mfs owned transmission and switching facilities  and network capacity leased from other carriers primarily in the united states and western europe 
the mfs merger is being accounted for as a purchase  accordingly  the operating results of mfs are not reflected in the company s results of operations and will be included from the acquisition date 
on august   mfs completed the uunet acquisition 
uunet is a leading worldwide provider of a comprehensive range of internet access options  applications  and consulting services to businesses  professionals and on line services providers 
uunet provides both dedicated and dial up internet access  and other applications and services which include web server hosting and integration services  client software and security products  training  and network integration and consulting services 
the mfs merger has allowed the company to take advantage of the congressional intent behind the telecom act and the fcc interconnect order by bringing together the leading growth companies from four key telecom industry segments long distance  local  internet and international 
the company believes that the mfs merger enhances the combined entity s opportunities for future growth  creates a stronger competitor in the changing telecommunications industry  allows provision of end to end bundled services over a global network  and provides the opportunity for significant cost savings for the combined organization 
on january   the company completed the wiltel acquisition for approximately billion in cash 
through this purchase  the company acquired a nationwide common carrier network of approximately  miles of fiber optic cable and digital microwave facilities 
the company s long distance revenues are derived principally from the number of minutes of use billed by the company 
minutes billed are those conversation minutes during which a call is actually connected at the company s switch except for minutes during which the customer receives a busy signal or the call is unanswered at its destination 
the company s profitability is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to achieve line costs that are less than its revenues 
the principal components of line costs are access charges and transport charges 
the most significant portion of the company s line costs is access charges which are highly regulated 
accordingly  the company cannot predict what effect continued regulation and increased competition between lecs and other ixcs will have on future access charges 
however  the company believes that it will be able to continue to reduce transport costs through effective utilization of its network  favorable contracts with carriers and network efficiencies made possible as a result of expansion of the company s customer base by acquisitions and internal growth 
on february   president clinton signed the telecom act which permits  without limitations  the bocs to provide domestic and international long distance services to customers located outside of the boc s home regions  permits a petitioning boc to provide domestic and international long distance service to customers within its home region upon a finding by the fcc that a petitioning boc has satisfied certain criteria for opening up its local exchange network to competition and that its provision of long distance services would further the public interest  and removes existing barriers to entry into local service markets 
additionally  there are significant changes in the manner in which carrier to carrier arrangements are regulated at the federal and state level  procedures to revise universal service standards  and penalties for unauthorized switching of customers 
the fcc has instituted proceedings addressing the implementation of this legislation 
in the fcc interconnect order  which was released on august   the fcc established nationwide rules designed to encourage new entrants to participate in the local service markets through interconnection with the ilec  resale of the ilec s retail services and unbundled network elements 
these rules set the groundwork for the statutory criteria governing boc entry into the long distance market 
the company cannot predict the effect such legislation or the implementing regulations will have on the company or the industry 
motions to stay implementation of the fcc interconnect order have been filed with the fcc and federal courts of appeal 
appeals challenging  among other things  the validity of the fcc interconnect order were filed in several federal courts of appeal and assigned to the eighth circuit court of appeals for disposition 
the eighth circuit court of appeals has stayed the pricing provisions of the fcc interconnect order 
the circuit justice of the supreme court has declined to review the propriety of the stay 
the company cannot predict either the outcome of these challenges and appeals or the eventual effect on its business or the industry in general 
on december   the fcc released the nprm seeking to reform the fcc s current access charge policies and practices to comport with a competitive or potentially competitive local access service market 
the nprm seeks comment on a number of proposals for a series of reforms to the existing switched access charge rate structure rules that are designed to eliminate economic inefficiencies 
in addition  the fcc proposes to use  either alternatively or in combination  two approaches for addressing claims that access charges are excessive  a transition to economic based pricing of access charges  and  for deregulation of incumbent local exchange carriers as competition develops 
the fcc is evaluating the use of either a market based approach  a prescriptive approach or a combination of both 
such charges are a principal component of the company s line cost expense 
the company cannot predict whether or not the result of this proceeding will have a material impact upon its financial position or results of operations 
in the nprm  the fcc tentatively concluded that information services providers including among others internet service providers should not be subject to existing interstate access charges 
however  the fcc recognized that these services and recent technological advances may be constrained by current regulatory practices that have their foundations in traditional services and technologies 
the fcc issued on december   a notice of inquiry to seek comment on whether it should  in addition to access charge reform  consider actions relating to interstate information services and the internet 
changes in the regulatory environment relating to the telecommunications or internet related services industry could have an adverse effect on the company s internet related services business 
the telecom act may permit telecommunications companies  bocs or others to increase the scope or reduce the cost of their internet access services 
the company cannot predict the effect that the notice of inquiry  the telecom act or any future legislation  regulation or regulatory changes may have on its business 
in december  the fcc adopted a new policy that will make it easier for united states international carriers to obtain authority to route international public switched voice traffic to and from the united states outside of the traditional settlement rate and proportionate return regimes 
in february  the united states entered into a wto agreement that should have the effect of liberalizing the provision of switched voice telephone and other telecommunications services in many foreign countries over the next several years 
as a result of the wto agreement  worldcom expects the fcc  among other things  to reexamine its policies regarding i the services that may be provided by foreign owned united states international common carriers  including carriers owned or controlled by foreign carriers that have market power in their home markets  and ii the provision of international switched voice services outside of the traditional settlement rate and proportionate return regimes 
although the fcc s new flexible settlement rate policy  and the wto agreement and any ensuing fcc policy changes  may result in lower costs to the company to terminate international traffic  there is a risk that the revenues that the company receives from inbound international traffic may decrease to an even greater degree 
the implementation of the wto agreement may also make it easier for foreign carriers with market power in their home markets to offer united states and foreign customers end to end services to the disadvantage of worldcom  which may face substantial obstacles in obtaining from foreign governments and foreign carriers the authority and facilities to provide such end to end services

the charge is based upon a valuation analysis of the technologies of mfs worldwide information system  the internet network expansion system of uunet  and certain other identified research and development projects purchased in the merger 
the company believes that the efforts to complete these projects will consist of internally staffed engineering costs and further development and construction of the network 
these costs are estimated to be approximately billion and will be incurred over the next five years

as a result of the refinancing  worldcom recorded an extraordinary charge of million  net of million in taxes  related to the charge off of the unamortized portion of costs associated with the refinanced debt 
the credit facility has a five year term and bears interest  payable in varying periods  depending on the interest periods  not to exceed six months  at rates selected by the company under the terms of the credit facility including a base rate or the libor  plus applicable margin
