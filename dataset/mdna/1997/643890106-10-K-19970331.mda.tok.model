the consolidated financial statements of necb include the accounts of necb and its wholly owned subsidiaries  nebt and eqbk which became a subsidiary of necb on november  management s discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes of necb presented elsewhere herein 
overview necb reported net income for of  or per share 
this represents a increase over the  earned in on an earnings per share basis  increased over the earnings per share for the earnings and earnings per share for represented an and improvement  respectively  over the  or per share earned in growth in net income and earnings per share during primarily reflects the impact of the company s merger with the equity bank and the acquisition of manchester state bank together the acquisitions coupled with a strong net interest margin 
both transactions were accounted for as purchases and  as such  prior year comparative data were not restated to include information about either entity 
returns on average assets for  and were  and  respectively  while returns on average equity were  and 
these widely used performance benchmarks are illustrative of necb s improving performance during the last three years 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled  for compared to  in the net interest margin for was versus in the increase in net interest income is largely due to the acquisitions together with an improved mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the provision for possible loan losses was  in compared to  in the increased provision recorded in is primarily related to the growth experienced in conjunction with the acquisitions 
noninterest income increased to  in from  in the increase is largely the result of the acquisitions  which provided an additional  of recurring noninterest income in other factors which served to increase noninterest income in included a increase in the gain on sale of loans and a nonrecurring payment from the state of connecticut for the settlement of a class action suit brought by financial institutions concerning the taxability of certain investments 
noninterest expense totaled  in  compared to  in the increase is primarily the result of the acquisitions  net of the cost reductions derived from the elimination of duplicate operations 
total loans at december  amounted to  compared to  at december  while total deposits amounted to  at december  compared to  at december  in both cases  the increases were largely attributable to the acquisition of manchester state bank which provided  in loans and  in deposits 
acquisition summary in november  the company created a second bank subsidiary when it merged with the equity bank eqbk 
at the time of the transaction  eqbk had approximately million in assets and operated out of a single office in wethersfield  connecticut 
in july  the company completed its acquisition of manchester state bank msb which was subsequently merged with and into new england bank nebt 
msb was a million bank headquartered in manchester  connecticut  and operated three branches in the town of manchester 
in an agreement dated february   the company agreed to acquire first bank of west hartford which will  like msb  be merged with and into nebt 
the agreement is subject to the approval of regulators and the shareholders of both necb and first bank and is expected to close in july net interest income net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings  represents the largest component of necb s operating income 
the principal earning asset of the company is its loan portfolio which is comprised of loans to finance operations of businesses located within our market area  mortgage loans to finance the purchase or improvement of properties used by businesses and mortgage and personal loans to individuals 
representing a quarter of the company s earning assets  necb s investment portfolio also plays an important part in the management of the company s balance sheet 
while providing a source of revenue  these funds are used to provide reserves and meet the liquidity needs of the company 
excess reserves are available to meet the borrowing needs of the communities we serve 
for the following discussion  interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis 
fte interest income restates reported interest income on tax exempt loans and securities as if such interest were taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of for all periods presented 
amounts in thousands interest income financial statements    tax equivalent adjustment interest expense    net interest income fully taxable equivalent    in  net interest income on a fte basis was  a increase over the  reported in the  for represented an increase of  or from the  increase in was primarily the result of the acquisitions which together helped serve to increase interest earning assets by approximately  and interest bearing liabilities by  in consolidated average balances interest earned or paid rates amounts in thousands interest interest interest average earned average earned average earned balance paid rate balance paid rate balance paid rate assets interest earning assets federal funds sold    investment securities       loans a       total interest earning assets       allowance for loan losses    cash due from banks    other assets    total assets    liabilities interest bearing liabilities regular savings deposits       now accounts    money market deposits    total savings deposits       time deposits       borrowed funds  total interest bearing liabilities       demand deposits    other liabilities   total liabilities    equity    total liabilities equity    net interest income fte basis    net interest spread net interest margin a average loans include nonaccruing loans 
the net interest margin measures the difference in yield on  and the mix of  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is affected by a number of factors including the volume  pricing and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and interest rate fluctuations 
changes in nonperforming assets  together with interest lost and recovered on those assets also affect comparisons of net interest income 
several factors served to increase the net interest margin to in from in noteworthy was the effect of combining necb s balances with those of the acquired banks 
added to this was a general reduction in market interest rates and changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
each of the acquired banks brought with them an interest rate structure which  when compared to the company s existing structure  generally included higher rates earned and paid 
this had the effect of increasing the average rates of the combined company 
management believes that  absent the general decrease in market rates in  the effect of the acquisitions would have been a modestly reduced net interest margin when compared to the overall decrease in market rates is most evident in the change to the average prime rate which occurred during the prime rate is generally defined as the rate banks charge on loans to their most creditworthy borrowers and other interest rates are frequently indexed to the prime rate 
the prime rate averaged during compared to for source the wall street journal 
finally  the increase in the percentage of earning assets represented by loans coupled with an increase in demand deposits noninterest bearing helped serve to increase the net interest margin 
insert average earning asset mix securities loans other average interest bearing liabilities increased to  in  from  in  primarily due to the acquisitions 
the interest rates paid on these liabilities averaged in compared to in the basis point increase in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities time deposits in particular reflects the generally higher rate structure of the acquired institutions 
overall  the company expects that given the current interest rate environment and the competitive costs of attracting and retaining core deposits the net interest margin will decrease modestly during rate volume analysis changes in net interest income between years is divided into two components the change resulting from the change in average balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities or volume and the change in the rates earned or paid on these balances 
the change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be segregated  has been allocated proportionately to the absolute values of the changes due to volume and rate 
the following table is presented on a fte basis 
amounts in thousands change due to change due to increase change in increase change in decrease rate volume decrease rate volume interest earning assets federal funds sold investment securities   loans      total interest income change      interest bearing liabilities regular savings deposits now account deposits money market deposits total savings deposits time deposits     borrowed funds total interest expense change     net interest income change     as is shown above  the majority of the increase in net interest income in is attributable to changes in volume which is primarily the result of the acquisitions 
noninterest income for  noninterest income increased from and totaled  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
service charges  fees and commissions totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of 
included in service charges  fees and commissions are fees on deposits  loan servicing fees and other fees and charges 
most of the increase in this category can be attributed to the acquisitions which together provided an additional  of recurring fee income in atm usage fees and fee income from the company s debit card program mastermoney together rose from  in to  in gains on sales of loans increased by  and totaled  for compared to  for for  the company increased its production of mortgages originated for sale by  from  in to  in the increase is largely due to the company s expanded market area taken together with the relatively favorable interest rate environment experienced in with fixed rate conventional mortgage rates below for most of  borrowers preference for financing home purchases with fixed rate mortgages remained strong 
as part of its asset liability management process  necb generally sells these mortgages in the secondary market 
correspondingly  the related servicing income increased approximately and totaled  in compared to  in noninterest expense total noninterest expense was  in and  in the increase of  or is primarily the result of the acquisitions 
in  total noninterest expense increased  or to  from  in the largest component of the increase in noninterest expense in resulted from the  increase in salaries and employee benefits which again is primarily due to the acquisitions 
occupancy expense and furniture and equipment rose in response to capital outlays for technological upgrades and improvements in conjunction with the purchase and outfitting of the company s new technology center in east hartford 
the center  which opened in march  was created to serve the changing information and systems needs of the company and its customers and is staffed by professionals drawn from both subsidiary banks 
outside services rose  in due to the integration of the acquired banks and for other initiatives 
reflecting both the improved financial condition of the company and the savings derived from aggregating coverages made possible from the acquisitions  insurance and assessments decreased  or from  in to  in intangible asset amortization amounted to  in  as  of goodwill was recognized in connection with the acquisitions 
management maintains control over noninterest expenses by assigning authority for expense incurring activities to specific managers and by providing these managers with tools for planning and monitoring the performance of their duties 
in working with senior officers  line managers are able to anticipate and minimize the expense of the goods and services needed to perform efficiently 
this ongoing management process coupled with the cost reductions derived from the acquisitions is illustrated by the improvement in the company s efficiency ratio which reached in efficiency ratio income taxes in  the company recognized income tax expense of  an effective tax rate of 
this compares to income tax expense of  in  an effective rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to increased investment in tax exempt securities and a reduction in the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets 
balance sheet analysis total assets increased to  at december  compared to  at december  the  in loans and  in deposits the company acquired in connection with the msb acquisition is primarily responsible for the increased asset size 
balance sheet highlights in thousands change total assets   earning assets   securities   loans   total deposits   equity   necb s securities portfolio increased  or from  at december  to  at december  while the amortized cost of securities available for sale increased from  at december  to  at december   securities held to maturity remained virtually unchanged and totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
the continued emphasis on holding securities available for sale allows the company to increase its commitment to intermediate term loans while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet the continuing needs of its customers 
the unrealized gain on securities available for sale increased to  at december   from  at december  loans the company s loan portfolio inherently includes credit risk 
necb attempts to control this risk in three principal ways i through a thorough analysis of applications for credit  ii maintaining an appropriate level of loan diversification  and iii continuing examinations of both outstanding and delinquent loans 
necb endeavors to identify potential problem loans early  to take charge offs promptly based upon realistic assessment of likely losses and to maintain adequate reserves for possible loan losses 
the company s portfolio is diversified by borrower  industry and product 
loan portfolio composition pie chart commercial and financial real estate construction residential commercial consumer total loans increased  from  at december  to  at december   this increase is largely the result of the msb acquisition 
in addition to the acquisition  necb added to outstanding loans by originating new loans which exceeded repayments and payoffs by  and purchasing loans of  from another lender 
in a market best characterized by moderate loan demand and highly competitive pricing  the company continued to target the small business market for both owner occupied real estate and for commercial and financial loans 
through both aggressive marketing and responsive loan officers  this effort is reflected in the change in the company s loan composition in it is the company s goal to become the preferred small business lender in its service area and thus the percentage of commercial and financial and commercial real estate loans should increase further in nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are assets on which income recognition in the form of principal and or interest has either ceased or is limited  thereby reducing the company s earnings 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned oreo 
generally  loans are placed in nonaccrual status when they are past due greater than ninety days or the repayment of interest or principal is considered to be in doubt 
in addition to nonperforming assets  the asset quality of the company can be measured by the amount of the provision  charge offs and several credit quality ratios presented in the discussion concerning provision and allowance for loan losses 
necb s nonperforming assets at december  through are presented below amounts in thousands years ended december  c 
nonaccrual loans      other real estate owned    total nonperforming assets      nonperforming assets increased  or to  at december  from  at december  at december   nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned and as a percentage of total assets were and  respectively  compared to and at december  the increase in total nonperforming assets in the year ended december  primarily resulted from the acquisitions 
oreo consists of properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings 
these properties are recorded at the lower of the carrying value of the related loans or the estimated fair market value less estimated selling costs 
charges to the allowance for loan losses are made to reduce the carrying amount of loans to the fair market value of the properties less estimated selling expenses upon reclassification as oreo 
subsequent reductions are charged to operating income

provision and allowance for loan losses necb s allowance for loan losses represents amounts available for future credit losses 
management continually assesses the adequacy of their allowances for loan losses in response to current and anticipated economic conditions  specific problem loans  historical net charge offs and the overall risk profile of their loan portfolios 
management allocates specific allowances to individual problem loans based upon its analysis of the potential for loss perceived to exist related to such loans 
in addition to the specific allowances for individual loans  a portion of the allowance is maintained as a general allowance 
the amount of the general allowance is determined through management s analysis of the potential for loss inherent in those loans not considered problem loans 
among the factors considered by management in this analysis are the number and type of loans  nature and amount of collateral pledged to secure such loans and current economic conditions 
based upon these analyses  the company believes that its allowance for loan losses at year end is adequate 
the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for possible loan losses for the years ended december  through the allowance is maintained at a level consistent with identified loss potential and the perceived risk in the portfolio 
it is not considered meaningful to allocate the allowance according to geographic area as necb s market area is homogeneous and limited in size

during  net charge offs increased  to  from  in of this increase  approximately  was from loans acquired from msb 
the majority of these loans had been specifically reserved by msb in anticipation of the need to be charged off 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans increased to in compared to 
in the allowance for loan losses decreased to of total loans at december  from at december  at december   the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming assets and as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was and  respectively  compared to and at december  the following table reflects the allowance for loan losses as of december  with allocations categorized by loan type amounts in thousands allocation of percentage of allowance for loan type to loans by type loan losses total loans commercial financial real estate construction residential  commercial  consumer total  as noted  necb s subsidiaries perform ongoing reviews of loans to determine the required allowance for possible loan losses at any given date 
to facilitate this process  an individual loan rating system is utilized 
in the review process  the subsidiaries assess factors including the borrower s past and current financial condition  repayment ability and liquidity  the nature of collateral and changes in its value  current and anticipated economic conditions and other factors deemed appropriate 
these reviews are dependent upon estimates  appraisals and judgments which can change quickly because of changing economic conditions and management s perception as to how these factors affect the financial condition of debtors 
the loan rating process classifies loans according to the subsidiaries uniform classification system 
the subsidiaries consider performing loans rated as substandard and doubtful to be potential problem loans 
substandard loans are characterized by well defined weaknesses such as deteriorating or inadequate collateral or impaired repayment ability 
a loan is considered doubtful when similar conditions exist but are more severe in nature 
at december   necb considered loans totaling approximately  to be potential problems compared to  at december  included in these totals were loans totaling  and  respectively  which were not classified as nonperforming loans because such loans are performing according to their terms 
deposits total deposits increased  or from  at december  to  at december  this increase is largely attributable to the acquisition of msb which provided  in deposits 
as discussed earlier  the interest rate structures of the acquired banks were frequently at or near the top end of the rates offered throughout their markets 
this often attracted funds from depositors who only sought the highest rates then being offered 
since the need for such funds was less prevalent after the acquisitions primarily due to moderate loan demand and a strong liquidity position  much of these funds did not stay with the company 
as a result  absent the effect of the acquisition  time deposits would have decreased by approximately  from this taken together with the company s focus on small business development helped shift the mix of deposits from higher priced time deposits to noninterest bearing demand deposits and now accounts 
the percentage of noninterest bearing demand deposits to total deposits increased to from at december  and  respectively 
asset liability management asset liability management provides for a structured process for prudently managing the company s liquidity  capital and market risk 
asset liability management is guided by policies reviewed and approved annually by the company s board of directors 
among other things  the policy delegates responsibility for asset liability management to the asset liability committee alco within each subsidiary bank 
the committees guide all the day to day asset liability management activities of the respective subsidiary 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of the company s income to short and long term changes in interest rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management is to control this risk within the limits and guidelines indicated in the company s asset liability policy 
the company identifies and manages its interest rate risk through both simulation models and gap analysis 
the simulation analysis is used to both measure and analyze the company s net interest income sensitivity over one and two year time horizons 
the simulation process involves the modeling of interest income and expense from the company s balance sheet during a specified period of time and under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
the model is used to examine the impact on earnings given an immediate basis point rise or fall in interest rates a shock or a gradual basis point rise or fall in interest rates a ramp as well as other forecasted interest change scenarios 
each model includes assumptions as to the effect of volume changes  prepayment rates and repricing characteristics for both contractual and noncontractual assets and liabilities 
gap analysis provides a point in time snapshot of the maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s balance sheet 
the report is prepared by allocating all assets and liabilities according to either contractual or anticipated maturity or repricing 
the company s policy specifies that the cumulative one year gap should be less than of total assets 
as is shown in the table below  as of december   the company was 
liability sensitive at the cumulative one year gap 
interest rate gap analysis december  cumulatively repriced within amounts in thousands  by repricing date months to to after or less months years years total cash    securities      loans      loans held for sale   other assets   total assets      deposits demand     savings      time     total      short term borrowings   other liabilities   equity   total liabilities and shareholders equity      periodic    cumulative gap   cumulative gap as of total assets through both the modeling process and the complementary gap analysis  management believes that the exposure of the company s income to either a rate shock or gradual change in interest rates is modest 
liquidity risk management s objective for liquidity risk is to ensure the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to meet their obligations 
these obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature and the ability to fund existing and new loan commitments 
accordingly  necb s subsidiaries have liquidity policies which provide flexibility to meet cash needs 
the liquidity objective is achieved through the maintenance of readily marketable investment securities as well as a balanced flow of asset maturities  prudent pricing on loan and deposit products and the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
liquidity at necb is measured and monitored daily  enabling management to identify and respond to trends occurring in the company s balance sheet 
in nebt joined the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb to further enhance its liquidity position 
the fhlbb provides its member banks with credit by accepting as collateral the member bank s mortgage assets 
through its membership  nebt has available a line of credit for  and also has the ability to pledge up to  of its assets to meet its credit needs 
eqbk has available a line of credit for  and has the ability to pledge up to  of its assets to meet its credit needs 
necb has alternative sources of liquidity available including federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
purchases of federal funds and borrowing on repurchase agreements may be utilized to meet short term borrowing needs 
necb believes that its policies will enable it to maintain adequate liquidity and to prudently commit funds to loans or investments  depending upon underlying risk  demand and rate of return 
as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows  necb experienced an increase of  in the amount of cash and cash equivalents at december  compared to december  this compares to a decrease of  in  compared to december  the increase in was largely due to the acquisition of msb coupled with a decrease throughout the year in interest bearing account balances 
capital at december   total shareholders equity was  an increase of  compared to  at december  in july  in acquiring msb   shares of common stock were issued by necb at a value of  also increasing capital in was the retention of  in earned income   from shares issued in conjunction with exercise of stock options and a  increase in the unrealized holding gain on securities available for sale 
during  shareholders equity increased  to  from  at december  in november  capital increased  when the company issued  shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of eqbk 
following the acquisition  eqbk has been operating as a subsidiary of necb 
the company endeavors to maintain an optimal amount of capital upon which an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over the short and long run while meeting all regulatory requirements for minimum levels of capital 
as of december   the company exceeded all regulatory capital ratios and the subsidiaries were categorized as well capitalized 
the various capital ratios of the company for december  and were minimum level total risk based tier risk based leverage recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
