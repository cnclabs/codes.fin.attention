overview of in january  the new jersey board of public utilities bpu unveiled its draft phase ii report of the new jersey energy master plan draft phase ii report for deregulation of the electric utility industry 
the draft phase ii report requires pse g and other new jersey electric utilities to develop rate and service plans to give customers a choice of suppliers 
beginning in october  five percent of retail electric customer load of all classes will be given the ability to directly choose their electric power suppliers 
all customers would be phased in by april see competitive environment

under this order  pse g has provided electric customers with bill credits totaling million and will forego recovery of another million in energy costs that have been deferred 
the december st order resulted in a earnings loss of million  or cents per share 
other factors that decreased earnings were increased operation and maintenance expenses related to the outages at salem and the hope creek nuclear generating station hope creek and increased depreciation expense due to more plant in service 
the earnings per share decrease was partially offset by higher gas sales in early due to favorable weather conditions  the gain on the repurchase of certain of pse g s outstanding cumulative preferred stock at a discount to par  increased investment income from psrc and a one time gain on the sale of edc see note discontinued operations of notes

pse g s share of total operating and maintenance expenses for both salem units for was million and capital costs were million  which includes million for steam generator replacement 
the outage of a salem unit causes pse g to incur replacement power costs of approximately to million per month 
such amounts vary  however  depending on the availability of other generation  the cost of purchased energy and other factors  including modifications to maintenance schedules of other units 
on january   the nuclear regulatory commission nrc staff placed salem units and on the nrc watch list and designated the salem units as category facilities a plant that is authorized to operate  but one that the nrc staff will monitor closely 
the nrc staff noted that this action was not due to any performance problems or decline during this evaluation period but that salem should have been previously designated as a category plant and would not be ready to leave that status until satisfactory integrated station performance at power could be observed 
competitive environment many forces are reshaping how the utility industry meets the needs and expectations of its customers and shareholders 
profound changes in the way the industry is regulated will affect how enterprise conducts business and its financial prospects in the future 
competitive changes in the utility industry continued to occur in and early with the issuance of federal energy regulatory commission ferc order no 
in july and the draft phase ii report issued by the bpu in january  enterprise is now in a better position to identify and develop strategies for addressing the issues that the changing regulatory structure presents 
draft phase ii report on january   the bpu addressed wholesale and retail electric competition in new jersey and proposed the restructuring of the electric power industry 
in  new jersey regulators plan to establish the rules that will eventually enable consumers in all market sectors to choose their providers of energy and energy service in the future 
with the emergence of this competitive marketplace  enterprise has and will continue to take significant steps to meet the challenges posed by this changing environment 
a summary of the draft phase ii report follows beginning in october  of retail electric customer load of all classes industrial  commercial and residential will be given the ability to directly choose their electric power supplier 
all customer load would be phased in  with the percentage increasing to in april  in october  in april  in october and in april beginning october  the rates for bundled electricity services  consisting of power generation  transmission  distribution and auxiliary customer services  such as metering and billing  would be unbundled 
each electric utility  including pse g  would continue to be responsible for providing distribution service to all customers  with price and service quality for distribution service regulated by the bpu 
other customer services would also continue to be offered by each electric utility for a monthly fee  including metering  billing and account administration  which would also be regulated by the bpu 
transmission service would be provided by an independent system operator iso which would be responsible for maintaining the reliability of the regional power grid and would be regulated by ferc 
utilities would continue to pass through the cost of transmission to customers in regulated rates 
metering and billing would also be reviewed in order to make recommendations for the introduction of competition into the customer services area 
a distribution utility would be permitted to offer customer side services  such as equipment repair and service contracts in a competitive marketplace 
the draft phase ii report states that a fully competitive marketplace must exist before the bpu will act to end economic regulation of power supply 
this will require  at a minimum  utility generating assets and functions to be functionally separated and operate at arms length from the transmission  distribution and customer service functions of the electric utilities 
the bpu would reserve final judgment on the issue of requiring divestiture of utility generating assets until detailed analyses of the potential for market power abuses by utilities have been performed 
in addition  the bpu indicated its belief that it is necessary to have a fully independent and operating iso prior to the implementation of customer choice 
the bpu proposes that retail competition in new jersey be introduced approximately to months after the implementation of full wholesale competition as provided by ferc order no 
each electric utility would be required to file  no later than july   complete restructuring plans  stranded cost filings and unbundled rate filings 
review of the filings would be completed by october consumer protections proposed include maintaining the electric utility as a universal service or basic generation service provider  continued funding of social programs now provided by electric utilities  registration of all third party power suppliers with the bpu  establishment of standards of conduct for third party power suppliers  and continued funding for energy efficiency programs 
utilities would have an opportunity for a limited number of years to recover through rates stranded costs associated with generating capacity commitments made prior to the advent of competition 
however  while the draft phase ii report proposes that the quantification of eligible stranded costs and a determination of stranded cost recovery should be undertaken on a case by case basis  recovery of all eligible stranded costs would not be guaranteed 
the opportunity for full recovery of such eligible costs would be contingent upon and may be constrained by the utility meeting a number of conditions  including achievement of the goal of delivering a near term rate reduction to customers of to 
the presumptive cutoff point for electric generation stranded cost recovery for each utility would be its last base rate case with costs incurred after such last base rate case to be subject to a greater burden of proof for recovery  including evidence of a market test to determine availability of cost effective alternatives 
pse g s last rate case was finalized on december   reflecting a test year ended of june  the draft phase ii report states that utilities are obligated to take all reasonably available measures to mitigate stranded costs caused by the introduction of retail competition 
a specific market charge would be a separate component of a customer s electric bill  to provide a mechanism to allow utilities the opportunity to recover stranded costs for a limited number of years  ranging from four to eight 
new jersey is currently studying the securitization of stranded costs as a means of financing these costs at interest rates lower than the utility s cost of capital  thereby helping to mitigate the rate impact of stranded cost recovery 
recovery of securitization may occur over a longer period of time 
the draft phase ii report suggests the need for federal action in a number of areas as an integral part of electric restructuring 
of particular concern is the transport of nitrogen oxides nox and other pollutants to new jersey from power plants located in the midwest and southeast 
new jersey will develop a contingency action plan if federal action fails to mitigate adverse environmental impacts caused by electric restructuring 
pse g is currently assessing the draft phase ii report s proposed findings and recommendations and in accordance with the proceeding requirements and will file formal written comments on february  on february   and   pse g participated in a phase ii public hearings and will work vigorously toward the goal of opening the new jersey marketplace to competition 
pse g also indicated its intent to develop and submit a comprehensive restructuring plan that meets the bpu s and pse g s shared objectives by the july  deadline 
since the phase ii proceeding is still in the proposal phase  pse g cannot predict the outcome of the final phase ii report 
ferc order no 
order no 
order no 
became effective on july  and requires all public utilities owning  controlling or operating transmission lines to file nondiscriminatory open access tariffs that offer others the same transmission service they provide to themselves 
by march   intra pool transactions for power pools must also be under a nondiscriminatory  pool wide open access tariff 
in july  the member companies of pennsylvania new jersey maryland interconnection pjm  including pse g but excluding peco energy company peco  filed a proposal to reorganize pjm into an iso to administer a pool wide open access transmission tariff and to operate a centrally dispatched bid based energy market in response to order no 
peco filed a separate proposal with ferc 
on november   ferc announced that it was rejecting the restructuring proposals of both peco and the other pjm companies due to concerns regarding the independence of the proposed iso and directed pjm to submit a single consensus pool restructuring proposal by december  on december   pjm submitted a pool wide open access transmission tariff and a reformed pooling agreement 
the filing consisted of a pro forma tariff and revised pool agreement that contained some of the same differences with peco as the earlier filings 
these differences were presented as side by side comparisons in the single filing 
ferc has not yet responded to the filing but is expected to do so by march  as a result of open access mandated by order no 
 there is likely to be increased competition from older  dirtier coal fired plants in the midwest that are subject to less restrictive pollution control requirements than utilities in northeastern states and consequently  produce lower cost energy 
these facilities  by increasing their power production in order to sell into the northeast market  will  in turn  increase the release of pollutants that eventually make their way to new jersey and other northeastern states due to the prevailing westerly winds 
pse g  which has to comply with strict new jersey environmental laws  will be at a competitive disadvantage if order no 
is not modified to recognize this issue 
numerous parties  including pse g  have filed requests seeking rehearing and clarification of various aspects of order no 
these filings are currently pending before the ferc 
after exhausting administrative remedies  judicial appeals of order no 
are also possible 
it is possible  therefore  that order no 
will be substantially modified 
njgrt a joint task force of the bpu and the new jersey treasury department has proposed replacing the current njgrt collected by utilities from their customers with a combination of a corporate business tax  state sales and use tax and a transitional assessment which would be phased out over an expected seven year time frame 
after the phase out is completed  the proposal would improve the competitive position of pse g vis a vis non utility energy providers in new jersey who do not collect such tax 
if this tax reform is not adopted  pse g would remain at a significant competitive disadvantage since pse g s rates would be up to higher than non utility energy providers 
pse g cannot predict when or if this proposal will be adopted 
gas unbundling on august   pse g filed its gas unbundling status report 
the filing also contained pse g s proposal for a residential gas unbundling pilot program to be known as selectgas 
if approved  this pilot program will allow certain residential natural gas customers to participate in a competitive marketplace 
the selectgas pilot program would involve four municipalities representing approximately  residential customers 
the review of the pilot program  including formal discovery  has been initiated 
pse g cannot predict when or if this proposal will be adopted 
off tariff rate agreement otra in  the bpu initiated a generic proceeding that would give pse g the ability to offer off tariff negotiated rates to customers 
although these otra s are offered at pse g s sole discretion  they are subject to bpu approval of minimum price  confidentiality of information  contract duration  regulatory filing requirements and other reporting requirements 
these negotiated otra s form part of pse g s overall strategy to retain customers in its service territory 
to date  three otra s have been filed with and approved by the bpu and pse g is currently in negotiations with several other customers 
pse g cannot predict how many customers will leave or stay in this increasingly competitive environment 
competitive transition charge ctc on september   pse g filed a petition with the bpu to establish an interim ctc 
the ctc is designed to recover stranded costs which may result from a customer leaving pse g s system as a full requirements customer 
if approved by the bpu as filed  this charge would apply to customers who  after september   commit to an alternate source of electric power while remaining physically located in pse g s electric franchise area 
further  this interim charge would be limited to customers with present billing demands in excess of kw 
the proposed charge would be interim pending bpu resolution of the draft phase ii report which addresses the stranded cost issue on a generic basis 
pse g cannot predict what action the bpu may take with respect to the ctc petition 
stranded costs recoverability of stranded costs is largely dependent on the transition rules established by regulators  including ferc and the bpu 
stranded costs that could result as the industry moves to a more competitive environment include investments in generating facilities  transmission assets  purchase power agreements where the price being paid under such an agreement exceeds the market price for electricity and regulatory assets for which recovery is based solely on continued cost based regulation 
since the energy master plan proceeding is still in the proposal phase  and recognizing that the issue of securitization and the extent of its application have not been determined  as well as the potential need for legislative action  management cannot predict the level of pse g s stranded costs or the extent to which regulators will allow recovery of such costs 
bond ratings the changes in the utility industry are attracting increased attention of bond rating agencies which regularly assess business and financial matters including how utility companies are meeting competition and competitive initiatives  especially as they affect potential stranded costs 
bond ratings affect the cost of capital and the ability to obtain external financing 
pse g continually updates the rating agencies on all corporate matters 
this minimizes surprises and gives the rating agencies time to comprehend the information 
given the uncertainty of the industry  attention and scrutiny of pse g s competitive strategies by rating agencies will likely continue 
this could result in changes to pse g s bond ratings 
eri on december   enterprise formed eri  which it believes better positions enterprise to enter the rapidly deregulating energy market by marketing products and services to industrial and commercial customers throughout the northeast and mid atlantic states 
eri has consolidated the operations of two former psrc subsidiaries with proven track records us energy partners  which sold natural gas  and enterprise strategic energy solutions  which provided consulting  engineering and repair services 
in addition  the financing of energy savings or demand side management projects  formerly offered by pse g s subsidiary  pscrc  will now be supplied by eri 
eri is expected to draw on enterprise s depth of experience and financial strength by offering a variety of services sales of natural gas and electricity  energy consulting  engineering  equipment installation and repair  inspection and diagnostic services for motors  generators and other energy conversion and use equipment  and up front financing

pse g believes it continues to meet the criteria to account for certain utility revenues and expenses in accordance with sfas however  if future events or regulatory changes limit pse g s ability to establish prices to recover its costs  pse g might conclude that it no longer meets the applicable criteria to defer certain expenses in accordance with sfas if pse g were to discontinue the application of sfas  the accounting impact would be an extraordinary  noncash charge to operations that could be material to the financial position  results of operations or net cash flows of enterprise and pse g 
pse g has certain regulatory assets resulting from the use of a level of depreciation expense in the ratemaking process that is less than the amount that is recorded under generally accepted accounting principles for non regulated companies 
pse g cannot presently quantify what the financial statement impact would be if depreciation expense were required to be determined absent regulation  but the impact on the financial position  results of operations or net cash flows of enterprise and pse g could be material 
statement of position environmental remediation liabilities sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants is effective for the fiscal years that begin after december  sop provides guidance where remediation is required because of the threat of litigation  a claim  or an assessment 
this statement does not provide guidance on accounting for pollution control costs as it applies to current operations  costs of future site restoration or closure that are required upon the cessation of operations or sale of facilities or for remediation obligations undertaken at the sole discretion of management

future outlook one of the most important lessons of was that deregulation is coming sooner  not later 
to meet the challenge of deregulation  enterprise is focusing on three business objectives getting the rules right  investing for growth and achieving operational excellence 
enterprise is seeking to ensure that the new rules on industry restructuring provide customer choice and lower cost without endangering public safety or compromising new jersey s stringent environmental standards 
equally important are the investments that keep the business growing 
to this end  enterprise will rely to a large extent on cea 
because of the substantial opportunities overseas  cea focuses on international markets 
cea is already established and competitive in several international markets 
another way enterprise will grow the business is by providing regional energy services through eri 
eri markets new and existing energy products and services to commercial and industrial business customers throughout the northeast and mid atlantic states 
as the deregulation of the gas and electricity markets increase  enterprise expects eri to play a significant role in its domestic growth 
enterprise is continuing to emphasize operational excellence as a key business objective 
enterprise is looking at all operating areas for opportunities to cut costs and increase efficiency 
as part of its commitment to operational excellence  enterprise is implementing a business integration system which is designed to increase operating efficiencies across all of its business organizations 
enterprise and pse g cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the ongoing changes that are taking place in the utility industry or predict whether such outcome will have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or net cash flows 
however  enterprise and pse g believe that the end result will involve a fundamental change in the way it conducts business
