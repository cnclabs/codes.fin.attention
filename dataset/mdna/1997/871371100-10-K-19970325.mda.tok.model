the new million borrowing arrangement converted previous term debt to revolving credit  reduced amortization requirements and increased the revolving availability by million 
the revolving credit available will decrease in and subsequent years 
at december   unused credit was million 
net cash provided by operations was million for  paced by net income of million 
approximately million of the net income resulted from a nonrecurring litigation settlement gain 
the october settlement required a one time lump sum cash payment of million by sylvan to extinguish postretirement medical benefits liabilities of more than million 
this  coupled with increased investment in inventory and accounts receivable of million  resulted in a million decline in net cash provided by operations  as compared with net cash flow from operations was also below the level of million  an amount which included nonrecurring items including an asset sale of and a nonrecurring benefit from the final collection of trade accounts receivable from the company s former moonlight mushrooms  inc subsidiary

during  spawn product income was enhanced by higher capacity utilization at the netherlands plant and the renovation and expansion of the united kingdom plant  as well as the startup of the new australian plant 
production cutbacks in the company s fresh mushroom operations  due to soft market conditions and a labor organizing effort  resulted in significantly lower operating income levels there 
the organizing effort caused a partial day work stoppage during march  and some continuing  sporadic picketing of customers retail stores 
competitive conditions throughout the us fresh mushroom industry are likely to continue through some  or all  of  resulting in an increasing dependence on spawn product income and income derived from international operations 
the company is evaluating a number of options which could improve income contributions from its fresh mushroom business  including leasing or selling some of the assets it utilizes in the latter stages of mushroom growing 
the alternatives are not expected to require material additional capital expenditures 
working capital requirements in were higher than in trade accounts receivable increased by million  or  as the company increased the proportions of its international sales and its spawn products  both of which have longer normal trade credit terms than mushroom products 
as measured by days of sales outstanding  accounts receivable increased to days for from days in inventory levels increased by million  or  but remained at days when expressed as days of inventory held

for  and  capital expenditures totaled million  of which more than was directed to spawn product operations expansion

funding for these investments will come from a combination of internally generated funds and from borrowings under the company s long term revolving credit facility 
since the closing of the company s moonlight mushrooms  inc subsidiary in  an aggressive effort has been made to settle various moonlight employee benefit liabilities 
settlement efforts generally involve negotiated agreements which result in lump sum cash payments which reduce or terminate future payment obligations 
during  in addition to an ongoing multi year effort to settle self insured workers compensation claims  the company made a one time cash payment of million as a settlement of moonlight s postretirement medical benefit litigation relating to certain retirees eligible for these benefits 
the settlement will reduce cash outlays for future years  with an expected million benefit in additionally  the company will benefit from a lower annual imputed interest expense due to the liability reduction 
cash outlays for self insured workers compensation liabilities are expected to decline to approximately million in these expenditures were million in  million in and million in the reduced cash requirements for employee benefit liabilities improve the company s ability to internally generate funds needed for capital expenditures
