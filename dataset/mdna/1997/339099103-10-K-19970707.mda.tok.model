operating costs in declined slightly to million  and dropped as a percentage of sales from percent in to percent in reductions in rv group costs more than offset increases in housing group expenses 
selling expenses of million were down five percent and were also lower as a percentage of sales  declining from percent to percent

additionally  the company completed the sale of fleetwood credit corp 
in may and received cash proceeds of million  net of income taxes 
cash flow generated from operations totaled million in compared to million in the prior year 
operating cash flow was unusually high in  largely as a result of a reduction in working capital used in the recreational vehicle business 
the company maintained a strong cash position in both years  with cash and investments totaling million at the end of compared to million in cash equivalents in received a boost near year end when the company assumed million in long term debt from its finance subsidiary and received a corresponding cash payment in return

during  four new manufactured housing plants were added and two were substantially completed  one of which will come onstream early in fiscal one new manufactured housing facility was added in improvements were also made at several existing plant locations during and capital expenditures in fiscal are currently estimated to be in the range of to million 
it is anticipated that plant additions will include one new manufactured housing plant that will be a satellite operation located near an existing fleetwood manufacturing center 
in addition  plant modifications are expected at several existing locations  along with the normal replacement of machinery and equipment 
it is anticipated that existing financial resources and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund these expenditures 
during the seasonally slow winter months typically november through february  the company has historically built inventories of recreational vehicles in order to meet the peak demand for these products in the spring 
this is usually accomplished without the use of debt financing  however  there have been occasions when the company has required the use of bank credit lines 
this situation occurred in the third quarter of fiscal which required the company to use uncommitted bank credit lines 
during the month of january  the company borrowed million for several days to meet working capital needs 
all borrowings were paid off during the fourth quarter 
the company has credit lines with its principal bank and another bank which are currently being used only to support letters of credit

with the exception of lumber  prices paid for raw materials and other manufacturing inputs have remained fairly stable throughout this period 
on a longer term basis  the company has demonstrated an ability to adjust the selling prices of its products in reaction to changing costs
