item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations continuing operations overview the company s services are provided to a broad array of governmental and commercial entities predominantly in the us market 
additionally  the company pursues selected international business opportunities on a project specific basis and has made an investment in a taiwan based company see revenues 
the company s business strategy is to provide its environmental services on a full service basis  particularly by focusing on its capabilities to manage complex environmental issues from the initial assessment of the level and extent of contamination through the design  engineering and execution of a solution which minimizes the client s total cost 
in  the company changed its fiscal year to consist of four thirteen week fiscal quarters with the fourth quarter ending on the last friday of march 
previously  the fiscal year ended on march of each year 
international technology corporation results of operations continued revenues revenues for fiscal year declined by compared to a decline of in fiscal year this decline in revenues generally reflected weak demand in both the governmental and commercial markets the company serves as well as a change in the company s approach to the market in de emphasizing smaller lower value projects see restructuring charge 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  however  the company experienced an increase in revenues to  from  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  principally due to consistent funding of dod programs which had been subject to reduced funding in late fiscal year and early fiscal year as a result of delays in the authorization of the federal budget 
although revenue growth in the company s core business is expected to be modest in the near future due to the difficult industry wide conditions  the company is actively seeking revenue growth and diversification through business acquisitions see liquidity and capital resources 
the company took an initial step in this strategy by making a majority investment in a taiwan based wastewater treatment design build firm in november additionally  in may  the company acquired phr environmental consulting  inc  a small consulting firm specializing in environmental and historical investigation 
revenues for fiscal year of  were  lower than the  of revenues for fiscal year effective with the inception of operations for quanterra in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company ceased recording any analytical services revenue 
however  since a portion of analytical services revenue historically was derived from the company s other operations  additional revenue is now being recorded related to analytical services subcontracts performed by quanterra see quanterra for it  similar to other third party subcontracts 
after excluding fiscal year and analytical services revenues other than those provided to the company s other operations  revenues for the company declined for fiscal year  primarily due to the slowdown of awards of federal governmental contract delivery orders caused by the delayed authorization of the federal government budget 
a substantial percentage of the company s revenues during the three years ended march  was earned through executing governmental contracts for various federal  state and local agencies 
revenues from governmental contracts accounted for of the company s revenues in fiscal year  compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
see the table in business operations customers federal  state and local governmental clients for an analysis of the company s revenues attributable to federal  state and local governmental contracts 
federal governmental revenues are derived principally from work performed for the dod and  to a lesser extent  the doe 
the company expects to increase its revenues from the doe over time due to an expected transition by the doe over the next several years to emphasize remediation over studies combined with the company s favorable experience in winning and executing similar work for the dod and the company s experience with doe related to its past performance of doe studies 
in the near term  the company expects that the percentage of total revenues from the execution of federal  state and local governmental contracts will continue to be substantial 
although increasing slightly as a percentage of total revenues  reflecting management efforts to reduce the company s reliance on government contracts  the company s revenues from commercial clients declined slightly in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company believes this is partly due to increased emphasis by commercial clients on cost effective solutions and partly due to commercial clients delaying certain work until final congressional action is taken on the reauthorization of cercla 
the company is focusing more on providing value added consulting service and on negotiating partnering arrangements with clients in an effort to provide commercial clients with more cost effective solutions 
as for cercla  it is uncertain when reauthorization will occur or what the details of the legislation  including retroactive liability  cleanup standards  and remedy selection  may include 
uncertainty regarding possible rollbacks of environmental regulation and or reduced enforcement have led commercial clients to delay projects as well 
contemplated changes in regulations could decrease the demand for certain of the company s services  as customers anticipate and adjust to the new regulations 
however  legislative or regulatory changes could also result in international technology corporation results of operations continued increased demand for certain of the company s services if such changes decrease the cost of remediation projects or result in more funds being spent for actual remediation 
the ultimate impact of any such changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the us economy and customers views on the cost effectiveness of the remedies available 
revenues derived from large  complex thermal remediation contracts utilizing the company s htts thermal treatment technology were approximately  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
incineration as a remedy under cercla continues to come under legislative and regulatory pressures 
because of this issue and the relatively higher cost of incineration  there are very few potential project opportunities in the united states and the company has been forced to seek alternative uses for its htts equipment 
the company is actively pursuing foreign opportunities which utilize the htts equipment 
if alternative uses  such as foreign installations  cannot be found or are uneconomical  there could be a negative effect to the company due to impairment of htts assets as well as lost project opportunities 
at march   the net book value of it s htts equipment was approximately  the company s backlog of contracts which utilize htts equipment was approximately  at march  with such backlog to be performed early in fiscal year the company s total funded and unfunded backlog at march  was approximately   at march  including approximately  of contracted backlog scheduled to be completed during fiscal year and between  and  of additional project work expected to be defined and performed in fiscal year under existing governmental ido contracts 
backlog revenues are expected to be earned primarily over the next one to five years  with a substantial portion of the backlog consisting of governmental contracts  many of which are subject to annual funding and definition of project scope 
the backlog amounts at march  and march  include  and  respectively  of future work the company estimates it will receive based on historical experience under existing ido programs 
in accordance with industry practices  substantially all of the company s contracts are subject to cancellation  delay or modification by the customer 
the company s backlog at any given time is subject to changes in scope of services required by the contracts leading to increases or decreases in backlog amounts 
these contracts subject to such scope changes have led to a number of contract claims requiring negotiations with clients in the ordinary course of business
