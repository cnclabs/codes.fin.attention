item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview chesapeake s revenue  operating cash flow exclusive of changes in working capital and production reached record levels in fiscal however  significant expenditures for acreage acquisition and drilling costs followed by unfavorable exploration and production results  together with increases in drilling and equipment costs and declines in oil and gas prices as of june   resulted in downward revisions in estimates of the company s proved oil and gas reserves and the present value of the estimated future net revenues from these reserves 
such excess caused the company to record a million asset writedown during the fourth quarter of the year and caused the company to report a net loss of million for the year 
chesapeake s strategy during fiscal  and particularly in the third and fourth quarters of the year  was to identify the potential of the various areas of the louisiana trend by exploratory drilling 
in several large areas outside of the masters creek portion of the louisiana trend  this exploration program was unsuccessful 
in these areas significant leasehold and drilling costs were added to the evaluated oil and gas property pool while insignificant quantities of oil and gas reserves were added to the company s proved reserve base 
during fiscal  the company participated in gross net wells  of which wells were operated by the company 
a summary of the company s drilling activities and capital expenditures by primary operating area is as follows in thousands capital expenditures gross net wells wells drilling leasehold total louisiana trend    oklahoma    texas    other    total    the company s proved reserves decreased to an estimated bcfe at june   down bcfe from bcfe of estimated proved reserves at june  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item and results of operations impairment of oil and gas properties 
due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company  there can be no assurance that the company s estimated proved reserves will not decrease in the future 
the company s business strategy in fiscal continued to emphasize the acquisition of large prospective leasehold positions which potentially provide a multi year inventory of drilling locations 
as of june   the company had approximately  gross acres of developed leasehold and million gross acres of undeveloped leasehold 
the fiscal drilling program  particularly in louisiana  consisted of more exploratory drilling than in previous years 
the company s strategy for fiscal is to reduce its capital expenditure program to approximately million  concentrate its louisiana trend drilling activities in masters creek  utilize more d seismic prior to conducting drilling operations  reduce the acquisition of additional unproven leasehold  and selectively acquire proved reserves 
this strategy will likely have the effect of reducing the company s anticipated production growth rate from exploration and development drilling to between and per year 
to assist the company in reducing exploratory risks and increasing economic returns the company has increased its use of d seismic 
the company has conducted  participated in  or is actively pursuing more than d seismic programs to more fully evaluate the company s acreage inventory

depreciation  depletion and amortization 

net wells drilled horizontal wells vertical wells net wells at end of period the company completed an offering of  shares of common stock in december resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
additionally  the company issued million in senior notes in march the company used the net proceeds from these offerings  along with cash flow from operations  to fund its net capital expenditures of million  repay all amounts outstanding under its commercial bank credit facilities  and retire million of senior notes 
results of operations general 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company realized a net loss of million  or a loss of per common share  on total revenues of million 
this compares to net income of million  or per common share  on total revenues of million in  and net income of million  or per common share  on total revenues of million in fiscal the loss in fiscal as compared to significantly higher earnings in fiscal and fiscal was largely the result of a million asset writedown recorded in the fourth quarter under the full cost method of accounting 
see results of operations impairment of oil and gas properties 
oil and gas sales 
during fiscal  oil and gas sales increased to million versus million for fiscal and from the fiscal amount of million 
the increase in oil and gas sales resulted primarily from strong growth in production volumes and significantly higher average oil and gas prices 
for fiscal  the company produced bcfe  at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to bcfe produced in fiscal at a weighted average price of per mcfe  and bcfe produced in fiscal at a weighted average price of per mcfe 
this represents production growth of for fiscal compared to fiscal and compared to fiscal the following table shows the company s production by major field area for fiscal and fiscal for the year ended june  production production mmcfe percent mmcfe percent texas   oklahoma   louisiana trend  all other fields  total production   the company s gas production represented approximately of the company s total production volume on an equivalent basis in fiscal this compares to in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease in gas production as a percentage of total production in fiscal was the result of drilling in the louisiana trend  which tends to produce more oil than gas 
for fiscal  the company realized an average price per barrel of oil of  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the company markets its oil on monthly average equivalent spot price contracts and typically receives a premium to the price posted for west texas intermediate crude oil 
gas price realizations increased from fiscal to from per mcf to per mcf  or  generally as the result of market conditions 
gas prices in fiscal averaged per mcf 
the company s gas price realizations in fiscal were also higher due to the increase in louisiana trend gas production  which generally receives premium prices at least equivalent to henry hub indexes due to the high btu content and favorable market location of the production 
the company s hedging activities resulted in decreases in oil and gas revenues of million  million  and none in fiscal  and  respectively 
oil and gas marketing sales 
in december  the company entered into the oil and gas marketing business by establishing a subsidiary to provide primarily natural gas marketing services including commodity price structuring  contract administration and nomination services for the company  its partners and other oil and natural gas producers in the geographical areas in which the company is active 
the company realized million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in fiscal  with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of million  resulting in a gross margin of million 
this compares to sales of million  expenses of million  and a margin of million in fiscal there were no comparable marketing activities in fiscal oil and gas service operations 
on june   peak usa energy services  ltd  a limited partnership peak  was formed by peak oilfield services company a joint venture between cook inlet region  inc and nabors industries  inc and chesapeake for the purpose of purchasing the company s oilfield service assets and providing rig moving  transportation and related site construction services to the company and others in the industry 
the company sold its service company assets to peak for million  and simultaneously invested million in exchange for a partnership interest in peak 
this transaction resulted in recognition of a million pre tax gain during the fourth fiscal quarter of reported in interest and other revenues 
a deferred gain from the sale of service company assets of million was recorded as a reduction in the company s investment in peak and is being amortized to income over the estimated useful lives of the peak assets 
the company s investment in peak is accounted for using the equity method  and resulted in million of income being included in interest and other revenues in fiscal revenues from oil and gas service operations were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the related costs and expenses of these operations were million and million for the two years ended june  and respectively 
the gross profit margin of in fiscal was up from the margin in fiscal the gross profit margin derived from these operations is a function of drilling activities in the period  costs of materials and supplies and the mix of operations between lower margin trucking operations versus higher margin labor oriented service operations 
interest and other 
interest and other revenues for fiscal were million which compares to million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the company realized million in interest  million of other investment income  million from its investment in peak  and million in other income 
during fiscal  the company realized million of interest and other investment income  and a million gain related to the sale of certain service company assets  offset by a million loss due to natural gas basis changes in april as a result of the company s hedging activities 
during  the company did not incur any such gains on sale of assets or basis losses 
production expenses and taxes 
production expenses and taxes  which include lifting costs and production and excise taxes  increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these increases on a year to year basis were primarily the result of increased production 
on an mcfe production unit basis  production expenses and taxes increased to per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in fiscal and per mcfe in fiscal during fiscal and  a high proportion of the company s production was from the giddings field  much of which qualified for texas severance tax exemptions 
the company expects that operating costs per mcfe will continue to increase in fiscal based on the company s expected production mix and drilling activities in oil prone areas which generally have higher operating costs than gas prone areas and because a higher percentage of the company s production will not qualify for severance tax exemptions as compared to the past 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
the company utilizes the full cost method to account for its investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  certain capitalized internal costs  dry hole costs and tangible and intangible development costs are capitalized as incurred 
these oil and gas property costs along with the estimated future capital expenditures to develop proved undeveloped reserves are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on the ratio of current production to proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by the company s independent engineering consultants and company engineers 
costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the amortization computation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property or whether impairment has occurred 
to the extent that capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and gas properties  such excess costs are charged to operations 
prior to january  the company completed operations on one exploratory well in each of three separate areas outside masters creek in the louisiana trend 
between april and july  the company completed operations on ten company operated exploratory wells located outside masters creek in the louisiana trend that resulted in the addition of only bcfe of proved reserves 
cumulative well costs on these non masters creek properties were approximately million as of june  of the wells  one was completed on april   one on may  and eight after june  based upon this information and similar data which had become available from outside operated properties in these non masters creek areas of the louisiana trend in late june  management determined that a significant portion of its leasehold in the louisiana trend outside of masters creek was impaired 
during the quarters ended march  and june  the company transferred million and million  respectively  of non masters creek louisiana trend leasehold costs to the amortization base of the full cost pool 
oil and gas prices declined from per bbl and per mcf at june  to per bbl and per mcf at june  drilling and equipment costs escalated rapidly in the fourth quarter of fiscal due primarily to higher day rates for drilling rigs  thus increasing the estimated future capital expenditures to be incurred to develop the company s proved undeveloped reserves 
the oil and gas price declines and the increased costs to drill and equip wells caused the company to eliminate gross proved undeveloped locations in the knox field which contained an estimated net bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves 
similar factors combined with unfavorable drilling and production results eliminated approximately bcfe of proved reserves in the giddings  and louisiana trend areas 
in the independence area of the giddings field of texas  a single well completed in late march which the company had estimated to contain bcfe of company reserves at march   was significantly and adversely affected by another operator s offset well which damaged the reservoir and reduced the company s estimated ultimate recovery to bcfe of reserves 
in late june  management reviewed its march  internal estimates of proved reserves and related estimated discounted future net revenues from its proved reserves  and giving effect to fourth quarter drilling and production results  oil and gas prices  higher drilling and completion costs  and additional leasehold acquisition costs and delay rentals incurred in areas subsequently determined to have less reserve potential than had previously been estimated 
after considering all of these factors  management estimated that at june  it would have capitalized costs of oil and gas properties which would exceed its full cost ceiling by approximately million to million and on june   issued a press release which included this estimate 
subsequently  based on the company s final year end estimates of its proved reserves and related estimated future net revenues  which took into account additional drilling and production results  management determined that as of june   its capitalized costs exceeded its full cost ceiling by approximately million 
no such writedown was experienced by the company in fiscal or fiscal oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and gas properties for fiscal was million  million higher than fiscal s expense of million  and million higher than fiscal s expense of million 
the expense in fiscal excluded the effects of the asset writedown 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the company s dd a rate in the future will be a function of the results of future acquisition  exploration  development and production results  but the company s rate is expected to trend upward in fiscal based on projected higher finding costs for the louisiana trend and higher drilling  completing  and equipping expenses throughout the oil and gas industry 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization d a of other assets increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal this increase in fiscal was caused by an increase in d a as a result of increased investments in depreciable buildings and equipment  and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of senior notes in may  april and march the company anticipates an increase in d a in fiscal as a result of a full year of debt issuance cost amortization on the senior notes issued in march and higher building depreciation expense on the company s corporate offices 
general and administrative 
general and administrative g a expenses  which are net of capitalized internal payroll and non payroll expenses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal  and up from million in fiscal the increases in fiscal as compared to fiscal and result primarily from increased personnel expenses required by the company s growth and industry wage inflation 
the company capitalized million of internal costs in fiscal directly related to the company s oil and gas exploration and development efforts  as compared to million in and million in the company anticipates that g a costs for fiscal will continue to increase as the result of wage inflation in the oil and gas industry and legal fees associated with the uprc and shareholder litigation 
interest and other 
interest and other expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in and million in fiscal interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  reflecting the issuance of the senior notes and the senior notes in march in addition to the interest expense reported  the company capitalized million of interest during fiscal  as compared to million capitalized in fiscal and million in fiscal interest expense will increase significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the million senior notes issued in march and reduced levels of capitalized interest expected in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal  before consideration of the million tax benefit associated with the extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt  as compared to income tax expense of million in and million in all of the income tax expense in and was deferred due to tax net operating losses and carryovers resulting from the company s drilling program 
the company s loss before income taxes and extraordinary item of million created a tax benefit for financial reporting purposes of million 
however  due to limitations on the recognition of deferred tax assets  the total tax benefit was reduced to million 
at june  the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million for regular federal income taxes which will expire in future years beginning in management believes that it cannot be demonstrated at this time that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets  comprised primarily of the net operating loss carryforward  will be realizable in future years  and therefore a valuation allowance of million has been recorded in fiscal a deferred tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock options of approximately million was allocated directly to additional paid in capital in  compared to million in and million in fiscal the company does not expect to record any net income tax expense in fiscal based on information available at this time 
hedging 
periodically the company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production 
these strategies include swap arrangements that establish an index related price above which the company pays the counterparty and below which the company is paid by the counterparty  the purchase of index related puts that provide for a floor price below which the counterparty pays the company the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor  the sale of index related calls that provide for a ceiling price above which the company pays the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling  and basis protection swaps 
results from hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the company s oil and gas production 
entered into hedging transactions unrelated to the company s oil and gas production or physical purchase or sale commitments 
as of june   the company had the following oil swap arrangements for periods after june nymex index strike price month volume bbls per bbl july  august  september  october  november  december  january through june  the company entered into oil swap arrangements to cancel the effect of the swaps for the months of august through december at an average price of per bbl 
as of june   the company had the following gas swap arrangements for periods after june houston ship channel index strike price month volume mmbtu per bbl july  august  september  october  the company had entered into gas swap arrangements to cancel the effect of the swaps for the months of july through october at an average price of per mmbtu 
the company has entered into a curve lock for bcf of gas which allows the company the option to hedge april through november gas based upon a negative differential to december gas any time between the strike date and december gains or losses on the crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are recognized as price adjustments in the month of related production 
the company estimates that had all of the crude oil and natural gas swap agreements in effect for production periods beginning july  terminated on june   based on the closing prices for nymex futures contracts as of that date  the company would have paid the counterparty approximately  which would have represented the fair value at that date 
these agreements were not terminated 
periodically  the company s oil and gas marketing subsidiary cemi enters into various hedging transactions designed to hedge against physical purchase commitments made by cemi 
gains or losses on these transactions are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas marketing sales in the consolidated statements of operations and are not considered by management to be material 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities inclusive of changes in components of working capital decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease from fiscal to was significant changes in the components of current assets and liabilities  specifically million of short term investments at june  cash provided by operating activities is expected to be a significant source for meeting forecasted cash requirements for fiscal cash flows from investing activities 
significantly higher cash was used in fiscal for development  exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties as compared to fiscal and approximately million was expended by the company in fiscal net of proceeds from sale of leasehold  equipment and other  as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or approximately 
in fiscal the company expended million net of proceeds from sale of leasehold  equipment and other 
net cash proceeds received by the company for sales of oil and gas equipment  leasehold and other decreased to approximately million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  other property and equipment additions were million primarily as a result of its million investment in the louisiana chalk gathering system and masters creek gas plant as well as the purchase of additional office buildings  improvements and related equipment in oklahoma city 
cash flows from financing activities 
on december   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
approximately million of the proceeds was used to defease the company s million senior notes due  and million of the proceeds was used to retire all amounts outstanding under the company s commercial bank credit facilities 
on march   the company concluded the sale of million of senior notes due the senior notes  and million of senior notes due the senior notes  which offering resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the senior notes were issued at of par and the senior notes were issued at of par 
the senior notes and the senior notes are redeemable at the option of the company at any time at the redemption or make whole prices set forth in the respective indentures 
in april the company terminated its commercial bank facilities 
in fiscal  cash flows from financing activities were million  largely as the result of the issuance of  shares of common stock net proceeds to the company of approximately million and million of senior notes due the senior notes 
the company may  at its option  redeem prior to april  up to million principal amount of the senior notes at of the principal amount thereof from equity offering proceeds 
the senior notes are redeemable at the option of the company at any time at the redemption or make whole prices set forth in the indenture 
financial flexibility and liquidity 
the company had working capital of approximately million at june  during fiscal  the company invested in a number of oil and gas related businesses and projects 
the most significant of these was the company s initial investment made in bayard  consisting of an million subordinated note and million of common stock 
in august  the company entered into an agreement with bayard to invest up to an additional million and convert certain options  warrants and note amounts that will facilitate a potential initial public offering by bayard 
on august  bayard filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of its common stock 
chesapeake  subsequent to the completion of the transaction noted above  will own  shares of bayard common stock of the common stock outstanding and anticipates selling substantially all of its ownership in bayard in the ipo assuming the over allotment option is exercised and receiving repayment of the subordinated note 
if successful  assuming the sale of all of the company s bayard stock  and based on the initial filing price of bayard at per share  the company would receive total proceeds of approximately million net of offering costs and realize a pre tax gain of approximately million 
no assurance can be given  however  that bayard will successfully complete the initial public offering of its common stock  at what price  or that the net proceeds or pre tax gain discussed above will be realized by the company 
the company also made investments in louisiana trend gas gathering and processing facilities which it may sell during fiscal these investments include a interest in the louisiana austin chalk gathering system  and a interest in the masters creek gas plant 
if the company decides to sell these investments  the company expects that the proceeds should exceed the company s cost basis of million as of june  the company currently maintains no commercial bank credit facilities because of its substantial working capital position  anticipated proceeds from the sale of the investments described above  and expected cash flows from operations as compared to the fiscal capital expenditure budget 
although the senior note indentures contain various restrictions on additional indebtedness  based on asset values as of june   the company estimates it could borrow up to approximately million of commercial bank debt within these restrictions 
debt ratings for the senior notes are ba by moody s investors service and bb by standard poors corporation as of september  the company s long term debt represented approximately of total capital at june  there are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the senior notes until june the company s goal is to achieve an equity to capital ratio of at least and to increase its credit ratings  ultimately achieving an investment grade debt rating
