the pursuit of any acquisition opportunities which may become available and the implementation of the company s business plan on a more rapid timetable than the company presently contemplates also may require the company to issue additional debt or equity securities or to consider possible changes in its capitalization or structure

seasonality the business of the company is highly seasonal 
approximately of the company s revenues are generated during the six month period of april through september 
as a result  the company s operating income can be expected to be substantially lower in the first and last three months of the year than the second and third quarters 
furthermore  since many of the attractions at the parks involve outdoor activities  prolonged periods of inclement weather result in a substantial reduction of revenues during such period 
inflation the effects of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the consumer price index  have not had a material impact on the company s revenues or net income in recent years
