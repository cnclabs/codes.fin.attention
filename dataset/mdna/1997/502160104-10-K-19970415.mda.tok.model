in this connection  the company has been concentrating on reshaping the automotive products business by the liquidation of certain of their assets that don t have the potential to earn an acceptable return and focusing on product lines that management believes have strategic advantages within select niche markets 
the company has also recruited new key management people in the automotive products business including marketing  materials control  manufacturing  and financial 
the company continues to explore its alternatives to accomplish these goals 
in addition  the company has been liquidating certain slow moving inventory in the industrial products business in the ordinary course of business 
it is the present intention of the company to limit this business to lines of machine tools which should result in an acceptable return on capital employed 
certain statements contained in this overview are forward looking statements  and the results thereof could differ materially from such statements if the company is unable to liquidate such assets in a reasonable period or on reasonable terms  and if able to liquidate such assets  it may not be able to improve profits in the automotive products business or have an acceptable return on capital employed in these businesses if general economic conditions deteriorate drastically from the environment these businesses currently operate in or these businesses are unable to meet competitive pressures in the market place which restrict these businesses from manufacturing or purchasing and selling their products at acceptable prices 
the following table contains certain of the information from note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements about the company s operations in different industry segments for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands sales chemical    environmental control    industrial products    automotive products    gross profit chemical    environmental control    industrial products    automotive products    in thousands operating profit loss chemical    environmental control    industrial products    automotive products    general corporate expenses  net    interest expense    income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes   identifiable assets chemical    environmental control    industrial products    automotive products    corporate assets    total assets    gross profit by industry segment represents net sales less cost of sales 
operating profit by industry segment represents revenues less operating expenses before deducting general corporate expenses  interest expense  and income taxes 
as indicated in the above table the operating profit as defined declined from million in to million in  while sales increased approximately during the same period 
the decline in operating profit resulted in a loss from continuing operations before income taxes for of million 
this decline in operating profit is primarily due to lower earnings in the chemical business as a result of increased ammonia costs and underabsorbed overhead related to modifications at the company s el dorado  arkansas chemical plant complex and to the lower margins in the automotive products business and foreign sales income recognized in and not repeated in in the industrial products business as discussed in note to notes to consolidated financial statements

the downtime resulted in increases in manufacturing overhead and lower absorption of such costs 
the unabsorbed overhead combined with unexpected increases in the cost of the primary raw material  ammonia  led to higher cost of sales as a percent of sales and lower gross profit margins 
the chemical business purchases approximately  tons per year of anhydrous ammonia 
the cost of ammonia consumed by the chemical business in was per ton compared to in and in in november and december  ammonia prices took an unexpected increase to an average of per ton compared to an average of in november and december this spike had a disruptive effect on the fourth quarter results of operations 
the increased cost of purchased ammonia in was partially passed on to customers in the form of higher prices  but the entire cost increase could not be offset by higher sales prices resulting in lower gross profit margins 
ammonia prices continued to increase in averaging per ton in january and in february 
in march  the price of ammonia began to come down  but not in time to significantly reduce the cost of sales percent in the first quarter of the price for the chemical business purchased ammonia has declined to per ton as of the date of this report 
the chemical business has substantially finalized negotiations with bayer for the chemical business to build and operate on a long term basis a nitric acid plant located on property owned by bayer in baytown  texas
