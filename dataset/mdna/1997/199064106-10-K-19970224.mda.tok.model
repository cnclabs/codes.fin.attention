item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following summarizes the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
liquidity and capital resources columbus financial condition continues to be very satisfactory 
as closed  shareholders equity was  after repurchase of  shares of treasury stock compared to  at november  substantial positive working capital of  plus the company s forecasted future cash flow remains a sufficient source of capital to develop its undeveloped reserves as well as fund a modest exploratory program 
the  bank borrowing base of its credit facility has been designated by management for acquisitions of new oil and gas properties although the loan can be used for any legal corporate purpose 
revenues for without benefit of canada increased by compared to which did include three months of canadian operations while comparative us only revenues increased by 
this was primarily the result of higher natural gas revenues due to price and production increases 
net earnings of  or 
per share primary for compared to a net loss of  or 
per share  in generally  accepted accounting principles gaap require cash flows from operating activities to be presented 
net cash provided by operating activities has ranged from  to  during the last three years 
coupled with the available borrowing base under the company s credit facility this has provided the liquidity required to finance oil and gas capital expenditures and make treasury stock repurchases 
management believes that another measure commonly used in the industry although not gaap of a company s cash flow is one determined before any consideration is given to working capital changes and without deduction of explora tion expenses 
this is generally known as discretionary cash flow dcf for successful efforts companies 
dcf is important to present for successful efforts companies because under the full cost accounting method exploration costs are capitalized and do not affect operating cash flow 
exploration costs can be increased or decreased and dcf would still be comparable to cash flow of full cost companies 
columbus dcf for was  compared to  in which increase reflects higher natural gas and crude oil prices and production attained for the year 
dcf is calculated before debt service 
however  the company s long term debt does not require principal payments before july and interest expense on outstanding debt has been relatively insignificant each of the last three years 
management takes strong exception with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
which directs that operating cash flow should be determined after consideration of working capital changes and reflects its position on this matter in all of its public filings and reports 
such a requirement ignores entirely the significant impact on working capital  including the timing of income received for and expenses incurred on behalf of third party owners in wells  where a company such as columbus serves as an operator of properties with only a small working interest 
both discretionary cash flow and operating cash flow before working capital do not represent cash flows as defined by gaap and are not to be substituted for net income or cash available from operations and do not necessarily indicate that cash flows are sufficient to fund all cash requirements 
the company s us sales volume of natural gas averaged  mcfd during fourth quarter of was up from s average of  mcfd 
management s goal had been to surpass the former record of  barrels of oil equivalent per day benchmark attained for us production during the s third quarter but was unsuccessful although for the month of november   boe per day was reached 
during  columbus hedged natural gas prices by selling a swap of  mmbtu per month for the twelve month period from may through april at an average daily price of per mmbtu 
the swap was matched against the calendar monthly average price on the nymex and settled monthly resulting in an increase in revenues of  for the period from may through november and an increase in revenues of  during fiscal before its expiration in april the company subsequently entered into two new natural gas swaps by selling  mmbtu per month for the period from april through november with one at per mmbtu and a second at per mmbtu 
these volumes represented approximately of columbus gas production at the time 
to partially protect itself against possible escalating gas prices for october and november  the company purchased nymex futures contracts for those two months for  mmbtu of natural gas at and  respectively 
the october call contract was sold for a profit of  in june and the november call option was sold for  in september these partially offset losses from the swaps for those months 
for the eight month period  gas sales revenues were reduced by  as a result of the swaps because the market price at settlement exceeded the contract swap price 
columbus also entered into a swap of crude oil prices by selling  barrels per month for the twelve month period from january through december at an average daily price of per barrel with a cap of as upside protection should crude oil futures soar for an unseen reason 
this volume represented approximately of its then current monthly production 
the difference between the hedge price and the actual daily closing price on the nymex was settled monthly 
through november the swap reduced oil revenues by  with another  deducted for december because the market price at settlement exceeded per barrel 
columbus entered into another crude oil swap by selling a strip of  barrels per month for the twelve month period from november  through october  at an average daily price of per barrel 
this amount represents approximately of columbus current crude oil production 
a loss of  was incurred for the month of november also  columbus entered into a natural gas swap by selling  mmbtu per month for the period from march through october at per mmbtu 
this volume represents about of columbus current natural gas production 
the company s natural gas and crude oil swaps are considered financial instruments with off balance sheet risk which were in the normal course of business to partially reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
as calculated as of november   the company had natural gas and crude oil swaps with a notional value of approximately  and a market value of approximately  the market value changes constantly and over the term of the contracts could even result in a gain for the company 
should the price of crude oil and natural gas futures remain above the swap price each month  then the company revenues would be reduced 
in the case of crude oil for calendar year  the company capped that exposure 
columbus average daily rate of oil production us only for was more than the company s operation and management services segment remains profitable despite divesting the principal source of past profit generated in canada from processing fees 
columbus had outstanding borrowings of  as of november  against its line of credit with norwest bank denver  na having a borrowing base which was lowered in  at the request of the company  to  the credit is collateralized by oil and gas properties 
at the end of  the ratio of bank debt to shareholders equity was and to total assets was 
the debt outstanding used a libor option at an interest rate of 
subsequent to year end through february   the debt was further reduced by  to  the net increase or decrease in long term debt directly affects financing activities cash flow 
this cash flow item also reflects the purchase of treasury stock discussed below and benefits from the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
working capital at year end remained positive at  compared to  at november  this was achieved despite expenditures of  including  for acquisitions for new additions to us oil and gas properties as well as the purchase of  shares of treasury stock for  during the year 
in february a  share repurchase from the market was authorized and was restricted to a maximum price of 
these could be purchased from time to time during  and beyond out of available cash but not using bank borrowings 
through january  the company acquired  shares of that total  including s  shares  at an average price of per share 
during  capital expenditures incurred on oil and gas properties totaled  for acquisitions and development drilling and recompletions primarily in the south texas and gulf coast areas 
this amount differs from the capital expenditure shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows which includes cash payments made during for expenditures incurred but not yet paid as of s year end 
similarly  there have been expenditures accrued in that will not be actually paid until therefore  that statement s reported capital expenditure total is somewhat meaningless and amounts to little more than an accounting for bills paid during a given period 
the cash flows from investing activities benefited in by the  net proceeds received from the divestiture of resources 
results of operations it should be obvious that revenues and expenses are not entirely comparable to because of the aforementioned divestiture of the canadian subsidiary toward the end of the first quarter of total company revenues increased by in and if canadian operations are excluded from  the company s revenues increased by 
higher crude oil and natural gas prices and production are responsible 
the company s revenues decreased by in compared to but only by if canadian operations are excluded 
operating income increased to  in due to improved revenues compared to s loss of  which was affected by the impairment losses discussed below 
the operating loss in was caused by the lower revenues and higher depletion expense 
even without canadian operations and impairment losses included  operating income decreased from the table included below in oil and gas operations reflects the changes in both us and canada for the important areas of revenue  production and prices 
the company had record revenues in but operating income decreased from s results  which itself had been a record 
litigation expenses in were mostly related to two settled lawsuits 
interest expense rose in because of increased interest rates and amounts borrowed compared to which had decreased as rates and average bank borrowings declined 
net earnings in before impairment charge were at their lowest level since net earnings in did not match s for reasons previously discussed but a quick reiteration of those include increased exploration expense  litigation expense  interest expense  depreciation and depletion charge  and a higher effective tax rate 
impairment of long lived assets the company elected to adopt early as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires that an impairment loss be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flow of the asset 
the company reviewed impairment of oil and gas properties using expected prices and year end proved reserves which had been significantly reduced 
four areas in texas  oklahoma  new mexico and north dakota indicated that impairment losses were greater than previously estimated and that it was prudent to elect early adoption 
accordingly  a non cash loss of   after tax was recognized which was equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of each asset group 
as a result of the adoption of sfas future amortization and depletion expenses were expected to be lower since the total carrying value has been significantly reduced 
prior to september   a valuation provision was made if total capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  excluding unproved properties  by country  exceeded the present value of future net revenues from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves using constant prices discounted at less income tax effects related to differences between book and tax basis of the properties 
therefore  no impairment was necessary prior to adopting sfas because total capitalized costs in the us were far less than discounted future net revenues 
during an additional impairment of  was made for the oklahoma area because of abandonment of a new well drilled which caused the capitalized costs to again exceed the fair value in that area 
oil and gas operations the following discussion of the company s oil and gas operations is based upon the tables of production and average prices shown separately for the united states and canada 
see item  oil and gas properties and production 
the changes in the components of oil and gas revenues during the periods presented are summarized as follows production price change quantity change revenue change vs 
gas us gas canada total company gas oil us oil canada total company oil vs 
gas us gas canada total company gas oil us oil canada total company oil natural gas revenues in the us increased despite reductions from swaps for compared to as a result of higher prices and increase in production 
average prices for natural gas rose with increased demand and severely depleted storage levels following an extended winter heating season 
reported natural gas revenues were reduced by  
per mcf from swaps of natural gas while had increased revenues of  
per mcf 
production volumes increased as a result of additional interests from property acquisitions and the effect of newly developed wells 
average prices in the spot market remain quite high during s first quarter due to very cold winter weather and low storage 
oil revenues in the us for were up from last year as a result of a increase in the average price received and higher volumes 
oil revenues and average prices for have been reduced by  per barrel due to hedging losses 
the company had no oil hedges in crude oil production improved because of two new jackson sand oil wells in the sralla road field and a third discovery wi almost one mile southwest which commenced production in november these increases were sufficient to overcome normal production decline elsewhere 
natural gas revenues and production for decreased compared to primarily as a result of lower prices  lower gas production in the sralla road field  and a reversionary interest in the company s most productive gas well in the laredo area which accounted for about one half of the reduced gas production 
these more than offset new production from additional well connections in texas and oklahoma  average prices for natural gas decreased compared to but began to increase toward the end of fiscal oil revenues for the us for were up from as a result of a increase in the average price received 
in low crude oil prices dictated continued deferral of any full scale oil development program of undeveloped oil reserves located in the williston basin 
however  a moderate amount of drilling was planned for as a result of the oil swap 
this at least afforded some protection from previous drastic downturns in prices which had halted drilling plans before anything could be commenced 
us natural gas revenues and production for were significantly higher than because of new gas well completions in texas and oklahoma 
even with the inclusion of the unusual revenue gains from the natural gas swap  the average price realized in still decreased by compared to the company experienced normal decline in oil production in  but a few wells  which had been made uneconomic by oil prices and whose production had been curtailed awaiting improvement in oil prices  were returned to production during fourth quarter of also  the flooding of a river near houston in late  which required shutting in several wells  was primarily responsible for a drop in oil production of barrels per day compared to the average and resulted in a reduction in gas production of  mcfd for the fourth quarter of  compared to s third quarter 
us oil prices have fluctuated for several years with the same wide swings experienced in world crude oil price 
in there was a very slow recovery with the average price for the year about below in crude oil prices declined during mid year months but recovered by year end so that the average annual prices were higher than in the spring of crude oil prices rose quickly to above per barrel  declined briefly  then rose rapidly to almost per barrel by year end 
fluctuations of oil and gas revenues and operations in canada are consistent with the spin off of resources in february  ie vs 
revenues decreased which reflects the fact included only one quarter of canadian activity 
similarly  lease operating costs declined when comparing to lease operating expenses in the us increased in compared to because of incremental working interest acquisitions and several extensive work overs performed in an effort to make some wells more economic 
lease operating costs on a barrel of oil equivalent basis for were up slightly to compared to for lease operating expenses in the us increased in compared to because of a few expensive work overs 
lease operating costs on a barrel of oil equivalent basis for were up to compared to for lease operating expenses in the us had decreased in compared to because of fewer workovers and because several oil wells with high operating costs were shut in due to low crude oil prices 
also  most new well additions in were gas wells which usually have lower operating costs 
operating costs in the us as a percentage of revenues decreased to in due to higher unit prices 
this compares to in and in production and property taxes have approximated of revenues in and and varies somewhat annually based on production in texas where oil production tax rates are lower than gas production tax rates 
in the us the relationship of taxes and revenue is not always directly proportional because some local jurisdiction s taxes are based upon reserve evaluations as opposed to actual revenues or production for a given period 
operating and management services this segment of the company s us business is comprised of operations and services conducted on behalf of third parties and includes compressor rentals 
in  a profit of  was generated from this segment 
prior to the company s divestiture of resources  the company received significant operating service revenue from its share of processing fees at the carbon area liquid extraction plant 
those revenues also included fees from the processing of resources own gas  but no profit was generated from that portion of revenues since it was offset by a commensurate increase in columbus well operating expenses 
operating and management services us revenue has increased each of the last three years 
until divested in  canadian operations had contributed far greater operating margins but revenues in the us improved because of additional billings for operator services related to d seismic testing program and past audit adjustments 
these factors generated a  profit for the us segment compared to a  profit in specific amounts of reimbursed revenues from operating and management services received from formerly operated partnerships are disclosed in note of the notes to the financial statements 
interest income interest income is earned primarily from short term investments whose rates fluctuate with changes in the commercial paper rates and the prime rate 
interest income decreased in to  compared to  in  primarily as a result of a decreased amount of investments and lower short term interest rates 
the increase in interest income in over was primarily the result of an increase in the amount of investments early in the year after divestiture of resources and higher short term interest rates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are considered to be those which relate to the direct costs of the company which do not originate from operation of properties or providing of services 
corporate expense represents a major part of this category although other nonbillable expenses are included herein 
the company s expenses were lower compared to because of salary and staff reductions made in august also  incentive bonuses all non cash totaled only  in compared to  in reimbursement for services provided by columbus officers and employees for managing resources for fiscal had been expected to decrease in anticipation that canadian based management would take over following a business combination with another junior oil and gas company 
however  merger discussions were placed on hold in september due to an indicated oil discovery by resources that could require a substantial evaluation period 
columbus general and administrative expense will increase when resources merger occurs in since no further staff reductions are planned 
reimbursement of  was realized in and  for all of fiscal year for providing these services to resources 
the company s us only expenses for were higher than s because employee salary and staff reductions were offset by higher compensation from cashless stock option exercises  increased fees associated with a regular listing on the amex  shareholder and stock transfer expense  professional services which included the fees of a second petroleum engineering firm and a higher matching percentage contribution to the company s k plan 
expenses for were higher than because of employee salary increases plus incentive bonuses of  that were awarded to all officers based on achievements of the company in also  employees had higher medical claims under the company s self insured plan and the company made a higher matching contribution to its k plan 
overall  the total of general and administrative expenses declined in compared to due to the spin off of resources 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas assets are calculated based upon the units of production compared to proved reserves of each field 
the expense is not only directly related to the level of production  but also is dependent upon past costs to find  develop and recover those reserves 
depreciation and amortization of office equipment and computer software is also included in the total charge 
total charges for depletion expense for oil and gas properties increased in over due to greater production despite the benefit realized from the write down of the carrying value of certain properties upon adoption of sfas during and  depletion expense for oil and gas properties increased by greater percentages than the increase in production 
contributing to the disproportionately higher depletion expense were much lower gas and crude oil prices during and  which tended to reduce reserves  shorten the estimated reserve life and change the economic limits of certain of the company s properties 
the lower carrying values of certain oil and gas properties after the impairment loss with the adoption of sfas effective september  helped to reduce depletion expense for the fourth quarter of for the depletion and depreciation rate for the company was per barrel of oil equivalent compared to per barrel of oil equivalent for fiscal and per barrel of oil equivalent in these amounts are still below the industry average primarily because of historically low finding costs 
however  without including the benefit of lower depletion costs of canadian gas properties for one quarter  the higher cost us additions would have raised the charge to per barrel of oil equivalent 
during the company wrote down us oil and gas properties that had been fully depleted in previous years totaling  as a charge against accumulated depreciation  depreciation and amortization 
there was no gain or loss to the company because the properties had been fully depleted 
exploration expense in general  the exploration expense category includes the cost of company wide efforts to acquire and explore new prospective areas 
until resources was divested in february  the company s exploration expense was primarily attributable to geological consulting work provided in canada plus limited seismic expense in canada and the us the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties requires that the cost of drilling unsuccessful exploratory wells and other exploratory costs be currently expensed 
during two exploratory wells drilled in oklahoma proved noneconomic and  was expensed 
most of the balance of the expense was for geological consulting 
during  seismic survey costs of  were incurred in canada and expensed while undeveloped leasehold costs in north dakota were impaired by  both of which contributed to an exploration expense of  in two unsuccessful exploratory wells were drilled at a net cost to the company of  including one in saskatchewan  canada and one in harris county  texas  about two miles west of the sralla road field 
the texas well also condemned certain leaseholds  while the company allowed other leases to expire 
altogether these resulted in an additional charge of  these exploration expenses reduce reported cash flow from operations  in addition to net earnings  even though they are discretionary expenses  however  these charges are added back for purposes of calculating discretionary cash flow 
retirement and separation expense during a total of  separation expense was paid to employees whose positions were eliminated and a total of  was accrued for retirement compensation for past years service for two employees who reached age and were approved by the board of directors to receive such compensation 
litigation expense the litigation expenses in and related to two lawsuits previously discussed in detail in prior annual reports 
the first  michael mattalino  bruce l 
davis and maris e 
penn vs 
columbus energy corp 
filed on april  was settled by agreement in september the second  porter farrell ii vs 
columbus energy corp 
filed october  had columbus motion for summary judgment granted on april  and the lawsuit was dismissed 
interest expense interest expense varies in a direct proportion to the amount of bank debt and the level of bank interest rates 
the average bank interest rate paid for us debt in  and was   and  respectively 
income taxes the company s income tax position is somewhat complex 
resources income was consolidated with the company s us income until columbus divestiture of resources in also  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards by the company has been complicated by two change of ownership transactions under section of the internal revenue code  one of which occurred on october  and the other on august  only the first of those changes is expected to limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
furthermore  a quasi reorganization occurred on december  which requires that benefits from net operating loss carryforwards or any other tax credits that arose prior to the quasi reorganization be credited to additional paid in capital rather than to income 
only post quasi reorganization tax benefits realized can be credited to income 
as a result of available net operating loss carryforwards  the company s federal income tax obligations have been limited to alternative minimum tax so that the company has had a current federal tax payable of less than of pre tax earnings 
beginning in  the company expects that the only operating loss carryforwards remaining will be from periods prior to the first section ownership change 
utilization of those benefits are limited to  per year so that the company s current federal tax provision and liability may increase in and thereafter unless an active drilling program is maintained 
in addition  the company pays state income taxes and previously  until its divestiture  also included canadian taxes on resources income 
as of november   additional carryforward tax benefits were considered realizable and the post quasi reorganization valuation allowance was reduced by  a deduction of  for disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options was taken and was added to additional paid in capital along with  for the reduction in the pre quasi reorganization valuation allowance 
the effective income tax rate increased because of higher canadian deferred taxes 
no tax credit for us income taxes was available to offset the effect of payment of canadian taxes 
during  the us net deferred tax asset was reduced to  which is comprised of a  current deferred tax asset and a  long term tax liability 
the deferred tax asset increased by an estimated  during the valuation allowance was increased by a net  even after canadian deferred taxes were reduced by  since such a provision was no longer required following the divestiture 
the estimated effective tax rate for was a book benefit 
during  the net deferred tax asset was reduced to  which is comprised of  current deferred tax asset and  long term liability 
the valuation allowance had a net reduction of  from to november  a deduction of  for the benefit of disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options added to additional paid in capital 
effects of changing prices the united states economy experienced considerable inflation during the late s and early s but in recent years has been fairly stable and at low levels 
the company  along with most other us business enterprises  was then and will be affected by any recurrence of such economic conditions 
recently  inflation has had a minimal affect on the company 
in recent years  oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated widely so the company s results of operations and cash flow have been directly affected 
oil and gas prices have also been significantly influenced by regulation by various governmental agencies  by the world economy  and by world politics 
operating expenses have been relatively stable but  when analyzed as a percentage of revenues  may be distorted because they become a larger percentage of revenues when lower product prices prevail 
drilling and equipment costs have risen noticeably in the last year 
competition in the industry can significantly affect the cost of acquiring leases  although in the past decade competition has lessened as more operators have withdrawn from active exploration programs 
inflation  as well as a recessionary period  can cause significant swings in the interest rates the company pays on bank borrowings 
these factors are anticipated to continue to affect the company s operations  both positively and negatively  for the foreseeable future
