item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations first virginia s net income was up in  reaching a record level of million compared to the million earned in as a result of the corporation s share repurchase program  begun in  the lower number of average shares outstanding caused the earnings per share to increase at an even greater rate of to  compared to the earned in over the past five years  first virginia s compound annual growth rate in earnings per share was 
the corporation s return on average assets rose two basis points to and  once again  exceeded the averages of its local and national peer groups  making it one of the top performing banks in the country 
the primary reason for the increase in net income was a million increase in net interest income as the net interest margin widened by six basis points to 
the corporation has achieved a net interest margin of or better every year since the margin increase in was caused by an basis point decline in the cost of funds to  which exceeded the seven basis point decline in the yield on earning assets to 
contributing to the lower rate of decline in the yield on earning assets was a shift in the mix of earning assets toward relatively higher yielding loans 
during  average loans comprised of earning assets compared to in  and by year end  loans comprised of earning assets 
also impacting net income favorably in was a continued reduction in fdic insurance expense  which declined to million 
this included a mandated one time payment of million to the fdic to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund 
the increase in net income produced an increase in the return on average shareholders equity of four basis points in to  compared to the earned in during the year the corporation repurchased and retired  shares of stock at a cost of million 
as a result  total shareholders equity was up nominally to million from the million balance at the end of because total assets were also up nominally for the year  the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets at year end was unchanged at 
the corporation traditionally maintains a higher capital position than its peer group of banks and has one of the highest capital to assets ratios among the largest banks in the country 
this is a direct result of the corporation s strict adherence to its principles of safety  income and growth  in that order 
this policy ensures that the corporation has ample capital to provide a cushion in times of adversity and flexibility to take advantage of expansion opportunities 
it has also permitted the corporation to increase the dividend on a regular basis 
during  the board of directors increased the dividend for the th consecutive year 
it was also the th consecutive year in which the dividend was increased at least twice during the year 
total assets at year end increased slightly to billion although average assets were up at a greater pace to billion 
during  the corporation purchased two in store banking offices with total deposits of million in the tri city area of east tennessee  marking the corporation s first venture into supermarket banking 
by the end of the year  an additional two in store banking offices were opened  and the corporation had commitments to open four additional in store locations in in  several acquisitions caused the increase in average assets over the acquisition of two banks in mid to late and the acquisition of million in deposits from a thrift in richmond  virginia 
average loans increased to billion  while actual loans at year end increased at a greater pace to billion 
loans to consumers secured by automobiles and originated through dealers increased and comprised approximately of the loan portfolio at the end of during  the corporation received the full benefit of loan production offices opened in the last two years and  coupled with some enhancements in product offerings  increased indirect automobile loan production by 
commercial loan activity began increasing late in the year  following a weak performance in  as businesses in the corporation s market area expanded and government contractor activity resumed the pace it lost in following the series of temporary shutdowns in the federal government 
deposits increased on average by during to billion  although the balance at the end of of billion declined slightly from the billion balance at the end of generally lower interest rates and all time high levels in the stock market meant the increased competition for funds from nonbanking areas such as mutual funds and stock brokers continued through year ended december vs vs vs earnings per share prior period net change during the year taxable interest income

statement of income net interest income the tables on pages through detail the increase in earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and demand deposits for the last three years  along with the related levels of fully taxable equivalent interest income and expense 
the variance in interest income and expense caused by differences in average balances and rates is shown on pages and the gradual and modest decline in interest rates begun in continued into the first half of and then slowed as the economy continued to perform well and inflation was held under control 
as a consequence  the federal reserve did not feel compelled to change rates during the last half of the year  and was characterized as a year of relative stability in interest rates 
the economy did not grow as rapidly in as it had in  which meant commercial and consumer loan demand moderated from the very strong levels of in  despite general rate decreases  the competition for funds meant first virginia s deposit costs did not decline as rapidly as the yield on earning assets 
in contrast  in  first virginia s cost of funds declined at a faster pace than its yield on earning assets due to the continued decline in interest rates and the more modest growth rate in loans 
as a consequence  the net interest margin increased six basis points in to  after dropping to its lowest level in since the cost of funds declined basis points to  while the yield on earning assets only declined seven basis points to 
the corporation s interest bearing liabilities are fully cycled at the end of  and further reductions in the cost of funds are not likely unless rates drop further 
the yield on loans should increase slightly during as lower yielding loans originated in previous years mature and are replaced at higher rates 
as a result  the corporation expects a modest increase in the net interest margin in net interest margin the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods net taxable equivalent interest income increased over this was caused by an increase in the net interest margin as a higher proportion of the corporation s earning assets were invested in loans 
interest income from loans increased  despite a basis point reduction in yield stemming from an increase in average loans outstanding 
interest income on securities declined slightly  despite an increase in average outstandings  as the general decline in rates caused the yield to drop three basis points 
the corporation maintains a highly liquid  short term oriented investment securities portfolio that moves quickly with changes in market rates of interest 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased in to million compared to the million recorded in  continuing its steady increase from a low of million in several factors contributed to the increase in the provision for loan losses in  primarily the increase in outstanding loans 
however  net actual charge offs also increased after hitting an unsustainable cyclical low in when net charge offs totaled just 
of outstanding loans 
in  the net charge off rate rose six basis points over to  but it was still below the year average of 
also impacting the provision for loan losses was an increase in the allowance for loan losses of two basis points to recognizing the increases in net charge offs and modest increases in delinquency rates on consumer loans 
the allowance for loan losses covered net charge offs times at the end of  compared to times at the end of  and covered nonperforming loans by 
nonperforming assets represented 
of outstanding loans at the end of  down nine basis points from the 
at the end of  its lowest level in over years 
the corporation has a lower risk exposure to charge offs than many banks because most of its loans are made for small amounts to consumers and are generally well secured by assets such as automobiles or real estate 
these loans also have regular monthly repayment schedules  and their average duration is substantially less than their stated lives 
credit card loans are made primarily to the banks customers located in the corporation s trade area and contain a lesser degree of risk and delinquency than many competitors nationally solicited accounts 
the balance of the corporation s loans are made primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the corporation s trade area and are well secured 
less than of the corporation s loans are for land development and construction and much of that is for residential or owner occupied facilities 
the corporation does not have any international  national or highly leveraged credits  nor does it have any concentration of credit in any one industry that exposes the loan portfolio to adverse risk 
while approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio is comprised of automobile sector loans  the loans are for relatively small amounts to consumers with regular monthly payment schedules  and they are of the highest quality  with very limited risk 
noninterest income noninterest income increased in after rising in first virginia s objective is to increase noninterest income at a faster pace than noninterest expense  and this objective was met in both and the corporation has traditionally been more dependent on net interest income than other banking companies its size and has been actively seeking new sources of noninterest income in order to decrease this historic dependence 
income from trust services increased in  following an even larger increase in as the corporation continued to strengthen its presence in this area 
increased fees and changes in product mix have resulted in higher trust revenues with marginal increases in expense 
enhanced marketing development plans and additional product lines should help this area sustain above average growth over the next several years 
in  the corporation introduced an automobile leasing product through its network of automobile dealers 
income from this source more than doubled in  meeting the corporation s goals  and the product continues to be offered through more outlets 
under this product  leases are originated for a fee for a third party that assumes all credit  servicing and residual risk so that the corporation s exposure is limited 
also added as a new product in was real property title insurance  offered through the corporation s insurance agency 
originally available on consumer residential loans  the corporation extended this offering to commercial properties and in increased commission income from title insurance by 
while income from this source continues to increase  total insurance income in declined after remaining stable in income from credit life insurance continued to decline as a result of legally mandated rate reductions and lower volumes of home equity loan origination 
service charges on deposits increased after rising in income in rose due to the acquisition of farmers national bancorp in late  while income increased as a result of increased commercial account fees 
the corporation has been successful over the past several years in increasing the number of large national accounts with multiple locations to its servicing base 
higher volumes of consumer demand accounts caused return check and overdraft fees to increase in and in credit card fees declined slightly with a decrease in the number of accounts being charged an annual fee 
the corporation promotes a no annual fee card to respond to a more competitive market and to retain existing accounts 
this attractive product has enabled the corporation to increase its outstanding credit card loans and increase interest income  as well as generate higher interchange fees on cardholder activity 
income from electronic banking service fees  primarily interchange income from automated teller machines atms  increased in to million 
rule changes in at a number of atm networks now permit the corporation to charge a fee to noncustomers who use the corporation s atms 
in addition to increasing income from these machines  the changes have made the economics of placing atms in nonbranch locations more feasible 
as a result  the corporation has begun placing atms in high traffic  nonbranch locations such as convenience stores  shopping malls and public facilities 
the corporation currently has atms installed in its network 
income from point of sale terminals increased in and continues to grow as consumers accept electronic payment alternatives 
the corporation s policy is to hold all of its fixed income securities to maturity and  accordingly  there were no security sales producing gains or losses in at the end of  the corporation transferred million in securities to the available for sale portfolio with the intention to sell these securities in in order to take advantage of certain tax loss carry forwards and other benefits 
these securities were sold in early as planned and contributed to a gain of million for the year 
other noninterest income includes gains of million in and million in from the sale of mortgage servicing rights 
the corporation realizes a higher total profit in selling a package of servicing rights each year rather than selling individual loans with servicing released 
also included in other income in are gains of million on the sale of foreclosed real estate compared to a gain of 
million in noninterest expense first virginia s noninterest expense rose in  approximately the rate of inflation in the economy  after declining in excluding the acquisition of farmers national bancorp at the end of 
the corporation achieved an efficiency ratio of in compared to in and has consistently had an efficiency ratio better than its national and regional peer groups 
by strictly managing its expenses in good times and bad  the corporation has avoided the layoffs and restructuring charges common in many corporations today 
the low efficiency ratio is all the more remarkable at first virginia because of the extensive branch network the corporation maintains 
while more expensive to maintain  the branches generate a large portion of the low cost transaction oriented deposit accounts 
as income and sales targets were achieved in  the resulting performance and profit sharing payments caused salaries and employee benefits expense to increase at a slightly higher than inflation rate of 
pension plan benefit related expense increased  due primarily to a decline in the discount rate assumption of basis points to  caused by the decline in interest rates at the end of health care costs moderated as the corporation installed a new managed care health plan and  as a result  health care costs rose less than  after rising in despite an increase in the stock price during the year  expense from stock appreciation rights declined thousand as more officers elected to exercise their rights as options and the previously recorded expense was reversed 
occupancy expense increased in primarily as a result of increases in rent expense for existing locations that contain rent escalation clauses 
occupancy expense in increased  almost exclusively as a result of the acquisition of farmers national bancorp at the end of updating the branch automation system to the current generation of hardware and software caused an increase in equipment expense 
this update will significantly enhance the corporation s service delivery capabilities 
at the end of  the corporation upgraded its mainframe computer  increasing capacity and lowering cost 
full capitalization of the bank insurance fund in mid eliminated the fdic premium rate on banks in this caused a decline in fdic insurance expense in  following a drop in in  the corporation paid deposit insurance on some deposits purchased in prior years from savings and loans 
in the third quarter  a special one time assessment was made to all savings association insurance fund saif deposits that fully capitalized that fund 
as a consequence  the corporation paid a one time fee of million but will benefit in the future from reduced saif premiums now that the fund is fully capitalized 
the reduction in premiums should reduce expense enough to fully recapture the one time assessment within approximately years 
efficiency ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods amortization of intangibles increased 
million in due to the purchase of deposits at a premium for two in store banking offices in and four offices acquired from a savings and loan in intangible amortization increased million in as a result of the acquisition of two banks in accounted for as purchases 
the rise in other operating expense in was caused by a million increase in miscellaneous charge offs and a increase in virginia bank franchise taxes due to greater capital levels 
provision for income taxes income tax expense increased million in  slightly greater than the rate of increase in pretax income 
a lesser portion of the corporation s interest income came from nontaxable municipal securities as income from this source continues to decline 
the increase in income taxes in of million resulted mostly from increases in state income taxes in the state of maryland  a direct result of the acquisition of farmers national bancorp in late the corporation s effective tax rate increased 
to in  due to the decline in tax exempt municipal interest income 
the effective tax rate in increased to because of the increase in state income taxes in the state of maryland 
since  various changes in tax laws have reduced the availability and attractiveness of tax exempt securities for banks 
balance sheet first virginia s lending portfolio is its primary earning asset  generating over of its gross income and funded mostly from the deposits of its customers  which are almost entirely core deposits 
most of the corporation s short term borrowings are related to the commercial account cash management activities and are functionally equivalent to deposits 
the corporation does not rely upon purchased deposits or nondeposit funding sources  nor does it sell or securitize its loan assets 
the corporation s objective is to invest of its total deposits and short term borrowings in loans 
in  the loan to funding liabilities rate was  an increase over the ratio in and the ratio in average loans increased in compared to  following a increase in however  the apparent increase was a result of acquisitions accounted for as purchases in and a carryover into of strong loan growth in  so loan growth in was weaker than indicated and was actually flat compared to total assets increased nominally to billion  compared to billion at the end of  as total deposits declined slightly 
shareholders equity remained stable as a consequence of dividends paid to shareholders and the repurchase of million in common stock under the corporation s share repurchase program 
the table on the following page shows the average balances of the various categories of earning assets as a percentage of total earning assets for the years indicated

other earning assets 




overnight investments loans period end loans advanced in to billion  following a more modest advance in the largest component of first virginia s loan portfolio is in automobile related loans  particularly loans originated through automobile dealerships 
the corporation is a full service provider to the automobile dealership community and makes loans to consumers to finance their purchase of automobiles  loans to dealers to finance their inventory of automobiles called floor plan loans and  to a lesser extent  the dealer s physical plant and facilities 
approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio is automobile related 
loans to consumers for automobiles expanded in  after a expansion in and in gross production increased in as the full impact of new loan production offices  opened in in tennessee and the carolinas  was achieved 
in addition  the corporation enhanced its product offerings in virginia and tennessee to be more competitive  which also contributed to the increase in loan production 
in the past  the corporation marketed its loans through dealers primarily in the areas served by its member banks 
however  in  it began opening loan production offices in other areas  and based on the success of this strategy  it intends to continue expanding this activity in the future 
first virginia concentrates on the highest quality of automobile loans  primarily a and b credits 
most of these loans are made to consumers and are secured by new cars with a maximum life of the loan of five years 
the loan portfolio s high quality means net charge offs are significantly below industry averages and servicing costs are low 
each loan in first virginia s portfolio is individually reviewed by an experienced loan underwriter  and credit scoring models are not used 
this allows the corporation to give highly personal service and quick approval to the dealer originating the loan 
the portfolio contains an almost equal distribution between domestic and foreign automobiles  with no concentration in any particular make of car 
the corporation also makes loans directly to dealers to finance their sales inventory  which are fully secured by specific automobiles 
average floor plan loans in declined after increasing in  as sales volume increased and dealers moved to lower their inventory balances 
in early  a leasing product was introduced for consumers that is offered through the corporation s extensive dealer network  and income from this source increased in first virginia offers its leasing product in conjunction with an outside third party that assumes all of the financing and residual risk 
first virginia is committed to the automobile market  regardless of the economic cycle  and it devotes its primary lending resources to this area 
home equity loans declined in and in  after advancing in at the end of  home equity loans comprised of the loan portfolio  making them the second largest component of the portfolio 
as it does with automobile loans  first virginia pursues the highest quality home equity loans  with high underwriting standards that enable the corporation to show a nominal net charge off rate 
for example  the corporation typically requires a maximum loan to equity ratio of no more than 
these loans are originated through the banks branches and through first general mortgage company  a home equity mortgage loan company that operates in areas outside the corporation s banking markets 
a weakness in the economy of the corporation s primary market  the metropolitan washington  dc area  in late and early  led to corresponding weak lending volume 
faced with strong competition  new home equity loan volumes remained weak at the end of some competitors offered loans containing extremely low interest teaser rates and terms  with loan to equity ratios exceeding 
residential real estate loans advanced  after declining in  and comprise approximately of the loan portfolio 
the corporation s consumer real estate portfolio is mostly composed of year fixed rate mortgages and longer term mortgages with interest rates that adjust every three to five years 
these types of loans are more stable  with rates that equal market rates of interest and without the same level of prepayment risk 
revolving credit loans  primarily credit cards  increased over the end of after advancing at the more rapid rates of and  respectively  in and growth slowed in as fewer new account solicitations were mailed out 
first virginia promotes its card by offering one of the best low fixed rate  no annual fee card products in its market and generally has eschewed low teaser rates 
the corporation limits its solicitation efforts primarily to the geographic area of its member banks 
these practices have resulted in a more stable cardholder base  an increased penetration rate in acquiring new accounts and accounts that have a much lower charge off rate than national averages 
commercial loans declined at december   after increasing in the previous year 
the primary reason for the decline was the previously mentioned decline in floor plan loans to dealers that comprise of commercial loans 
loan activity was weak in due to the increased competition for high quality commercial loans  but it began strengthening in late as economic activity in the corporation s market area increased 
the corporation makes its loans to small and medium sized businesses in the communities served by its member banks  including loans to government contractors  high tech companies  hospitals  churches and country clubs 
these loans are typically in amounts between to million  generally up to a maximum amount of million 
construction and land development loans increased at the end of after declining in after several years of relatively little activity in this area  a consequence of the overbuilding in the late s  occupancy rates for commercial properties rose and home sales increased  leading to a rise in development activities in commercial real estate loans increased  following a rise in  and loans to tax exempt and industrial development authorities increased 
these loans  made for owner use properties  carry primarily floating or adjustable interest rates and reflect an increase in confidence and increased economic activity in the corporation s market area 
loans december in thousands consumer automobile      home equity  fixed and variable rate      revolving credit loans  including credit cards      other      real estate construction and land development      commercial mortgage 
     residential mortgage 
     other  including industrial development authority loans      commercial      loans  net of unearned income      loans and other assets that are not performing in accordance with their original terms are discussed on pages to investment securities the average outstanding held to maturity investment portfolio decreased nominally in to billion compared to billion during by year end  the portfolio had declined to billion from the previous year end balance of billion 
increases in loan growth exceeded deposit growth and the investment portfolio was permitted to mature to fund the loan growth 
the corporation has constructed its portfolio in a laddered approach so an approximately equal amount matures each month 
the corporation has classified virtually of its investment portfolio as held to maturity because it has both the ability and the intention to hold these securities to their stated maturity 
at the end of  approximately million in securities were reclassified out of the held to maturity category and into the available for sale category as permitted by a transition provision of sfas this was done for various tax purposes with the intention to sell the securities in consequently these securities were sold in the second quarter of and a million gain was realized 
the reclassification was not a change in the corporation s policy to hold all securities to maturity but simply a one time event enabling the corporation to take advantage of available tax incentives 
the corporation places primary importance on safety and liquidity in its investment portfolio 
accordingly  the majority of the portfolio is invested in us government and agency securities with a maximum life of approximately five years 
at the end of and  the average life of the portfolio was months and months  respectively 
at december   us government and agency securities comprised of the securities portfolio 
this percentage has been gradually increasing since when changes in federal income tax laws reduced the tax benefits derived by banks for investments in municipal securities 
the limited availability of bank qualified municipal securities and the reduction in yield caused by the loss of tax benefits has generally made municipal securities less attractive to the corporation 
first virginia has generally limited its investments in municipal securities to publicly issued municipal securities with a rating of a or better or to unrated  general obligation securities of municipalities in its market areas with which it is familiar 
in and  the corporation placed a higher portion of its portfolio in us government agency securities 
at the end of  approximately of the investment portfolio was comprised of agency securities compared to at the end of  and the corporation intends to maintain them at approximately that level 
the majority of the securities were in callable securities with stated lives of approximately five years  although their actual lives are generally shorter 
these securities give the corporation a higher but more variable yield and a higher level of potential liquidity 
the corporation generally does not invest in mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  structured notes or other types of derivative securities 
money market investments money market investments  consisting primarily of federal funds sold and securities repurchase agreements  are generally governed by the size of normally anticipated deposit swings and loan demand 
in  average money market investments increased to million after a temporary decline in to fund loan growth 
average money market investments were relatively unchanged in  rising to million 
deposits as in  deposit growth was modest  with average deposits increasing only 
interest rates declined modestly throughout  and interest rates paid on deposits declined after increasing in the competition for funds was most acute from nonbanking areas  as the stock market s record high advances in both and sparked strong growth in mutual fund sales 
the decline in rates reduced the corporation s overall cost of funds by basis points to 
average deposits millions of dollars noninterest bearing    interest checking    savings    money market consumer cds    large denomination cds there was a movement out of lower yielding categories of deposits such as consumer savings  and into the relatively higher cost certificates of deposit 
average consumer savings declined in  after dropping in  and have been in a steady decline since peaking in money market accounts increased in  but they too have generally been in a decline since peaking in in contrast  certificates of deposit advanced in  with most of the growth coming in the more liquid categories with month or less maturities 
large denomination certificates of deposit increased in and in and are comprised primarily of certificates from high net worth consumers and bear rates comparable to the corporation s smaller denomination certificates of deposit 
the corporation does not purchase brokered deposits nor does it solicit deposits outside of its primary market areas 
average demand deposits increased in  while interest checking plans declined a modest 
the increase in demand deposits of was a direct result of the december acquisition of farmers national bancorp 
with first virginia s stress on service and convenience  supported by an extensive network of convenient neighborhood branches  its deposits tend to be less susceptible to changes in interest rates 
during  the corporation opened four in store banking offices  a low cost alternative to full size branches 
these locations have higher sales potential and deposit growth as they offer further convenience to consumers 
the corporation has traditionally obtained a higher proportion of its deposits from low cost transaction accounts compared to its peers  and in  demand deposits and interest checking plans comprised of total average deposits  while consumer savings and money market accounts comprised 
maturity ranges for certificates of deposit with balances of  or more on december   are as follows in thousands one month or less  after one month through three months  after three through six months  after six through twelve months  over twelve months  other interest bearing liabilities short term borrowings consist primarily of commercial paper issued by the parent company and securities sold by the member banks with an agreement to repurchase them on the following business day 
these short term obligations are issued principally as a convenience to customers in connection with their cash management activities 
average short term borrowings from these sources increased in and in  and reflect the increase in the number of commercial customers using cash management services 
long term debt is comprised of capitalized lease obligations on branch office facilities that are not subject to prepayment and on one equipment note for the purchase of the corporation s mainframe computer 
a shelf registration for the issuance of million of senior notes was filed with the securities and exchange commission in moody s has indicated that the notes  when and if issued  will have a rating of a the corporation s commercial paper is rated p by moody s  and the lead bank s certificates of deposit are rated a a by standard poor s and aa by moody s  the highest rating of any bank s deposits in the corporation s market area 
shareholders equity first virginia has historically been one of the most highly capitalized banking companies in the nation  a reflection of its principles of safety  income and growth  in that order 
at the end of  the ratio of shareholders equity to total assets was unchanged from the at the end of the previous year and compared favorably to the maintained by similar banks in the corporation s peer group of to billion asset sized banks 
the tier leverage ratio increased by six basis points to due to a reduced level of intangible assets 
each of the corporation s individual banks maintains capital ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and all qualify as well capitalized banks  allowing them the lowest fdic premium rate and freedom to operate without restrictions from regulatory bodies 
the board of directors has approved several plans to repurchase the corporation s common stock since in  the corporation completed a million program initially approved by the board in the board approved a new program in to purchase million shares  which was later increased to million shares in connection with the announced acquisition of premier bankshares corporation 
during  the corporation purchased  shares under these programs and retired million in equity 
first virginia and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
the corporation exceeded the regulatory risk based capital requirements by wide margins  due in part to the high level of capital and the conservative nature of the corporation s assets

each member bank s internal loan monitoring system also provides a detailed monthly report of production  delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans 
this careful monitoring has resulted in a consistent record of low delinquencies and charge offs as well as few nonperforming loans in relation to the entire loan portfolio 
the corporation has no foreign or highly leveraged transaction loans  and loans are only made within the trade areas of the member banks or in adjacent states where the corporation maintains loan production offices generating high quality consumer installment loans 
loans are generally not participated with nor purchased from banks outside of the first virginia system 
in addition  participations between banks within the first virginia system must first be participated with the corporation s lead bank where a second comprehensive loan review process is performed 
approximately of the corporation s loans are made to consumers and are normally secured by personal or real property 
first virginia has no significant concentrations of credit to a single industry or borrower and its loans are spread throughout its market area 
the corporation s legal lending limit to any one borrower is approximately million  however  it generally limits its loans to any one borrower and related interests to million 
in special cases the corporation may exceed its internal guideline from time to time 
one of the corporation s specialty loan areas is the automobile finance area  and loans are made to consumers both directly in the branches of the member banks and indirectly through automobile dealerships 
roughly of the total loan portfolio is comprised of consumer automobile loans but because the loan amounts are relatively small and spread across many individual borrowers  the risk of any major charge offs is minimized 
the automobile loans produced by the corporation consist primarily of the highest quality loans  commonly referred to in the industry as a and b quality loans 
these loans contain substantially less risk characteristics than lower quality c and d subprime loans and have lower delinquency  charge off and collection costs 
during periods of economic weakness  the subprime loan categories generate very high delinquencies and charge offs 
however  the high quality loans the corporation specializes in experience only modestly higher delinquencies and charge offs in recessions compared to periods of strong economic growth 
the corporation also makes loans directly to high quality automobile dealers to finance their inventories 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets declined million in and represented

at the end of these levels of delinquencies are significantly below industry averages and reflect the high overall quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
a loan generally is classified as nonaccrual when full collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  when repossession  foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated  or when other legal actions are taken 
in the case of installment loans  a loan is placed in nonaccrual if payments are delinquent days  and for other loans after payments are delinquent for days 
credit card loans are charged off if they are days past due 
if collateral on a loan is sufficient to ensure full collection of principal and interest  an exception to the general policy might be made 
loans may also be placed in a nonaccruing status at any time prior to that indicated above if the corporation anticipates that interest or principal will not be collected

management s methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  and the growth and composition of the loan portfolio 
every commercial loan is reviewed and rated at least annually  and trends in the total portfolio are examined for potential deterioration in overall quality 
the corporation reduced the allowance steadily from the approximate level maintained at the time of the last recession to the current level of as credit quality in the portfolio improved and net charge offs declined 
the allowance increased two basis points in as a result of a six basis point increase in net charge offs to 
and an increase in loans past due days or more 
offsetting this was a decline in nonperforming assets of nine basis points and a decline in loans past due days or more 
the allowance covered net charge offs times at the end of compared to times at the end of and covered nonperforming loans by 
most of the corporation s loan portfolio consists of small  homogeneous loans to consumers with regular monthly repayment schedules  and accordingly  none of the allowance has been allocated to specific credits 
the corporation constantly monitors the level of the allowance considering its long term experience and short term individual loan requirements 
the allowance is charged when management determines that the prospect of recovery of the principal of a loan has significantly diminished 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when collected 
if asset quality and loan charge offs remain at the current level  the corporation intends to maintain an allowance for loan losses in the to range 
management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb any potential unidentified losses 
net charge offs declined to unsustainably low levels in and and have increased in and to near normal levels 
an increase in bankruptcies caused credit card loan net charge offs to increase in and in to the current level 
they are still below national peer group statistics  however  and credit card loans comprise only of the total loan portfolio 
losses in the corporation s largest loan component  indirect auto loans  increased in to million  however  this represents a charge off rate of only

liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates the primary functions of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of the corporation s loan and deposit customers 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation does not hedge its position with swaps  options or futures  but maintains instead a highly liquid  short term position in all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
one of the primary ways the corporation meets its liquidity needs is by scheduling the maturity of its investment securities so that approximately an equal amount will mature each month 
the weighted average life of the securities portfolio at the end of was months  only a slight increase from the approximately months at the end of because the corporation views its securities portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and safety  it does not necessarily react to changes in the yield curve in an attempt to enhance its yield 
accordingly  the average life of the portfolio does not fluctuate significantly as the corporation maintains a constant approach to its portfolio and invests primarily in us government and agency securities with a life generally no greater than five years 
municipal securities are also generally limited to lives of no more than five years  but availability and other factors mean they are occasionally purchased in serial issues with longer lives 
a cash reserve consisting primarily of money market investments is also maintained by the parent company to meet any contingencies and to provide additional capital  if needed  to the member banks 
most of the corporation s loans are fixed rate installment loans to consumers and mortgage loans with maturities longer than the deposits by which they are funded 
a degree of interest rate risk is incurred if the interest rate on deposits should rise before the loans mature 
however  the substantial liquidity provided by the monthly repayments on these loans can be reinvested at higher rates that largely reduce the interest rate risk 
home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates that are tied to the prime rate 
many of the loans not in the installment or mortgage categories have maturities of less than one year or floating rates that may be adjusted periodically to reflect current market rates 
these loans are summarized in the table on the following page

   total    first virginia s asset liability committee reviews the corporation s liquidity requirements and maximizes the corporation s net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
liquidity requirements are reviewed in detail for each of the corporation s individual banks  however  overall asset liability management is performed on a consolidated basis to achieve a consistent and coordinated approach 
one of the tools the corporation uses to determine its interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to examine the volume of interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the difference between the two is the interest sensitivity gap  and it indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income 
regardless of whether interest rates are expected to increase or fall  the objective is to maintain a gap position that will minimize any changes in net interest income 
a negative gap exists when the corporation has more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time period than interest sensitive assets 
under this scenario  if interest rates were to increase it would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   the corporation was liability sensitive in the short term under six months by approximately of earning assets  which declined to in months 
technically  the corporation may reprice interest checking  savings and insured money markets at any time and  accordingly  they have been classified in the day sensitivity category in the accompanying table 
while these accounts have been somewhat more subject to repricing in the last two years than in prior years  the degree and frequency of movement is limited  and they are much less sensitive than contractually possible

x x x first virginia also uses simulation analysis to monitor and manage interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  changes in interest rates and volumes are used to test the sensitivity of first virginia s net interest income 
simulation analysis uses a more detailed version of the information shown in the table above that includes adjustments for the expected timing and magnitude of changes in assets and liabilities that takes into account changes in assets and liabilities that may change at rates different from their contractual rates 
a large part of first virginia s loans and deposits come from its retail base  and they do not automatically reprice on a contractual basis in reaction to changes in interest rate levels 
accordingly  first virginia has not experienced the earnings volatility its interest sensitive gap position indicates it might 
due to the relatively larger proportion of lower cost core deposits  such as demand  interest checking  savings and insured money market accounts  the corporation will tend to do better in a higher interest rate environment than a low one since these deposits can be invested in higher yielding loans and investments 
however  the corporation has been able to maintain a net interest margin in excess of every year since  regardless of whether rates were high or low  and has been able to maintain adequate liquidity to provide for changes in interest rates and in loan and deposit demands 
quarterly results the results of operations for the first three quarters of have been analyzed in quarterly reports to shareholders 
the results of operations for each of the quarters during the two years ended december   are summarized in the table on pages and the results of operations for the fourth quarter are highlighted below 
net income of million was up compared to the million earned in the prior year s fourth quarter and represented a increase compared to the million earned in the third quarter 
a reduction in the average number of shares outstanding caused earnings per share to increase at a greater rate of to 
in the fourth quarter  compared to the 
earned in the net interest margin increased basis points to in the fourth quarter compared to the low of registered in the prior year s fourth quarter 
the increase in the net interest margin can be attributed almost entirely to a reduction in the cost of funds  which dropped basis points to as the steady decline in interest rates begun in the fourth quarter of continued throughout in contrast  the yield on earning assets dropped by only one basis point to as the yield on investment securities increased two basis points to and a higher proportion of earning assets was shifted out of investment securities and money market investments to relatively higher yielding loans 
noninterest income increased compared to the prior year s fourth quarter  led by a increase in income from trust services and a increase in income from other customer services  particularly electronic banking activity 
other income increased to million as the corporation recognized million in gains on sale of foreclosed real estate compared to 
million in the prior year s fourth quarter 
noninterest expenses increased compared to the fourth quarter of salaries and benefits expense increased 
this was slightly in excess of inflation because incentive based compensation rose as higher sales and income targets were met in upgrading branch automation equipment to provide an even higher level of customer service and sales opportunities caused a increase in equipment expense 
fdic insurance declined in the fourth quarter as bank deposits were not assessed a deposit premium 
also  a rebate was received for saif deposits following the special assessment in the third quarter that brought the saif fund for thrift related deposits to a full funding level 
nonperforming assets declined million to million and represented 
of outstanding loans compared to 
of loans at the end of the prior year s fourth quarter 
this marked the lowest level as a percentage of outstanding loans in over years 
net charge offs increased slightly to 
of outstanding loans compared to the 
in the prior year s fourth quarter 
the provision for loan losses during the fourth quarter was million compared to million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of it was up primarily as a result of the increase in outstanding loans and  to a lesser extent  the increase in net charge offs 
at the end of the quarter  the allowance for loan losses represented of outstanding loans compared to at the end of the prior year s fourth quarter
