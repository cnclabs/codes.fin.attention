this improvement of  is a result of increased oil and gas production and improved commodity prices 
gross natural volumes increased from  mcf to  mcf 
the increase in oil production was from  barrels to  barrels 
combined with strong oil prices  this improvement resulted in gross oil revenue increasing by from  in to  in the combined oil and gas revenue for was  as compared to  in earnings before interest  depletion  depreciation  amortization and income taxes ebitda increased to  or per share as compared to  in or per share 
the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of earnings for the year and for ebitda was  shares whereas the calculations are based on  shares 
the primary reason for this difference is the  shares from the roxbury plan of arrangement which were issued in september  and shares issued from treasury in operating expense oil and natural gas operating expenses increased from  in to  in on a boe basis  operating expenses fell to in from in an improvement of 
canadian operating costs fell from per boe in to in although operating expenses in the us varied slightly  per boe in versus per boe in  the increase in canadian gas production accounts for the differential

the calculation of depletion and depreciation is based on the evaluation reports as at december   prepared by the independent engineering consultants 
these reports assure unescalated pricing and do not recognize the results of subsequent drilling and completion between december  and the filing date of this annual report 
the amortization expense of  is derived from the costs of the roxbury plan of arrangement in these deferred charges are being amortized on a straight line basis over months from the date of acquisition

gross natural gas volumes increased from  mcf to  mcf whereas oil production almost doubled to  barrels from  based on a barrel of oil equivalent basis boe of to barrel equals mcf which in our opinion reflects the comparative financial value of oil and gas  production increased from  boe in to  in  an increase of 
gross revenue increased by from  in to  in whereas of the company s production is in the form of natural gas  the decline in the average gas price resulted in the rate of increase in revenue to lag behind in the increase in production

the calculation of depreciation and depletion is based on the evaluation reports as at december  which assumes unescalated commodity pricing and does not recognize the results of subsequent drilling and completion between december  and the filing date of this k annual report 
the amortization expense of  is derived from the costs of the plan of arrangement with roxbury capital corporation 
these deferred charges are being amortized on a straight line basis over months from the date of acquisition 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense of  in is an increase of  over  a change of 
the increase is due to a combination of consultants expense and office rent absorbed in a plan of arrangement with roxbury as well as on an increase in the level of remuneration

depreciation and depletion expense was  for as compared to  for the fiscal year 
the increase in these non cash expenses is due to the combination of increased production and the capital expenditures program which was focused on leasehold acquisition  seismic  geological and geophysical expenditures  specifically significant land acquisition at wildhay  the texas meridian joint venture and the drilling of the vermillion state lease well 
liquidity and capital resources twelve months ended december  to twelve months ended december  working capital as at december  was  as compared to  a year earlier

additional capital may be required if our planned drilling program results in a major discovery which would necessitate a major development program 
it is the company s intention to utilize cash flow from its production base  combined with cash reserves and bank lines to fund the capital expenditures 
in management s opinion  the company currently has sufficient cash available and financing resources available for it to fund ongoing operations
