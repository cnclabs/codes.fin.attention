acquisitions and operations the company continued to implement its strategy of growth and diversification through acquisition during fiscal two acquisitions were completed early in the fiscal year 
acquisitions completed in fiscal and in prior years were more fully integrated into the operations of the dames moore group of affiliated companies 
the most significant events affecting the comparability of fiscal results with those of the prior year were the acquisition of brw group brw and decisionquest  inc dq 
brw provides project planning  design and construction phase engineering services for transportation and infrastructure projects 
dq specializes in litigation support services for corporate clients and individuals  including strategy consulting  development of case themes  juror analysis and selection  preparation of demonstrative trial graphics  and witness preparation 
these two acquisitions serve unique markets and  in combination with other group companies  will facilitate further access to both public sector and private sector markets served by the company 
in fiscal  the combined revenues of brw and dq represented approximately and other smaller acquisitions approximately of the company s total net revenues 
o brien kreitzberg ok and walk haydel wh were acquired by the company near the beginning of fiscal  and completed their second year of operations in fiscal ok  which provides project and construction management services  experienced stable revenues but profitability was negatively impacted by overstaffing due to delayed start up on certain major projects 
in fiscal  the company initiated a restructuring which reduced ok staff levels and closed offices that are not actively involved in projects 
wh  which provides process engineering and design services  took advantage of increased activity in the oil and gas  petrochemical  and pulp and paper industries  to substantially increase its revenue base and profitability 
together  ok and wh produced approximately of the company s fiscal total net revenues 
the business units of the company  which account for the remaining of fiscal revenues  provide environmental and specialized engineering services through a worldwide network of offices 
these business units continued to be affected by constraints on environmental expenditures by both private sector clients and government agencies in the united states 
while business volume continued at essentially the same level as in the previous two fiscal years  two trends affecting the company s business also continued 
environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies remained essentially unchanged during fiscal  including further deferral of congressional reauthorization of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of superfund act 
the outlook for congressional action on superfund legislation in fiscal remains unclear 
a second factor was the continued modest decline in the percentage of revenues derived from us government projects 
as a percentage of the company s total business  net revenues attributable to us government projects were in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal a portion of the decline was attributable to three newly acquired companies  ok  brw and dq  whose us government revenues are relatively minor 
offsetting these trends in domestic markets  the company s international revenues grew by approximately in fiscal  continuing the strong growth of the previous two years 
this sustained growth trend reflects increased worldwide demand for engineering and environmental services related to major capital investment projects  as well as increased opportunities in developing countries 
the company s partially owned international affiliates generally performed well 
one such affiliate  an agricultural consulting group in australia  became totally owned through the company s acquisition of the majority owners shareholdings 
in spite of the growth in business volume  the profitability of international operations declined due to the inability to efficiently match staffing levels with project staffing needs in certain international venues 
in fiscal  the company initiated a restructuring which included employee reductions to bring staff levels in line with current project requirements 
the restructuring also included the closing of a small number of international offices 
as a means of diversifying its business interests while drawing upon the skills of the core business  the company established a new subsidiary in fiscal dames moore ventures dmv was formed to make equity investments related to the company s areas of expertise 
one of dmv s interests is a interest in dames moore brookhill llc dmb  which was formed with the intent of identifying environmentally distressed properties  acquiring an equity position in selected properties  undertaking on site remediation  and developing or selling the remediated properties 
dmb acquired a portfolio of contaminated real estate consisting of assets located throughout the united states 
dames moore expects to remediate the properties  after which they will be offered for resale 
the purchase of the contaminated properties was financed through a credit facility available to dmb 
the company intends to pursue further activities of this type in fiscal and beyond 
dmv s other activity was its minority equity participation in glencoe insurance  ltd  a company formed to offer earthquake insurance in california 
dmv revenues were insignificant in fiscal on march   the company acquired the bank debt of cleveland wrecking company cwc  a demolition contractor 
it is the company s intent to foreclose on the assets of cwc and to combine the operations of cwc with its own demolition contracting unit aeci previously known as aman environmental construction  inc to provide site demolition  decommissioning  cleanup  closure and redevelopment services on a nationwide basis 
in calendar year  the gross revenues of cwc were approximately million 
the company believes that it has continued to position itself to address existing and emerging markets 
its continuing investment in strategic growth initiatives  combined with the complementary services offered by recently acquired companies  future acquisitions  new ventures  and limited restructuring should produce increased earnings in fiscal and the years ahead 
however  the ultimate demand for the company s services will be dependent on a continuation of economic growth  private and public sector investment  enforcement of environmental regulations  and the company s ability to meet the competitive demands of the market for full service engineering  environmental  construction management  and litigation support services 
dames moore has a worldwide network of offices located in countries 
the company is staffed by over  employees
