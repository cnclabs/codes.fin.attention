in addition  there was a favorable change in mix as sales of backplane connection systems and circuit board test systems  whose product margins are generally lower than those of semiconductor test systems  were lower as a percentage of total company sales 
engineering and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  declined from in to in  as these expenses did not increase at the same rate as sales 
the dollar amount of these expenses grew million in as a result of increased investment in new product development of semiconductor test systems 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in compared with of sales in  as the dollar volume of these expenses grew by while sales increased 
interest income increased in to million due to an increase in the company s average invested balances and higher interest rates 
interest expense increased from million in to million in as a result of increased borrowing at megatest prior to the merger 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared with in the company utilized certain tax credit and operating loss carryforward amounts in to operate below the united states statutory rate of 
in  the effective rate increased as the tax credit and operating loss carryforwards were no longer available and certain merger expenses were nondeductible for income tax purposes

cash was used to fund additions to property  plant and equipment of million in and million in in  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of the company s stock on the open market 
cash of million was utilized in to purchase million shares under the buyback program 
the company believes its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance of million  together with other sources of funds  including cash flow generated from operations and the available borrowing capacity of million under its line of credit agreement  will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements in inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
if there were inflation  the company s efforts to cover cost increases with price increases could be frustrated in the short term by its relatively high backlog 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k and the company s annual report to shareholders may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in item business relating to the company s delivery time of unfilled orders  and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and planned capital expenditure  and stock repurchase requirements may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for test equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
the most recent downturn contributed to a decline in semiconductor test system orders 
there can be no assurance that any future increase in semiconductor test systems bookings for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
also  the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
from time to time the company is notified that it may be in violation of patents held by others 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights  or assertions of patent infringement against the company which are ultimately successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
lengthy and expensive defense of the company s rights to technology used in its products could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into products  and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to the company s success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including new product selection  development of competitive products by competitors  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
the company faces substantial competition throughout the world  primarily from electronic test systems manufacturers located in the united states  europe and japan  as well as several of the company s customers 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
certain of the company s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those currently offered by the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company derives a significant portion of its total revenues from customers outside the united states 
international sales are subject to significant risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and policy changes affecting the company s markets  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  the timing and provision of pricing protections and returns from certain distributors  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its competitors products  potential retrofit costs  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  and the timing of investments in engineering and development 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price
