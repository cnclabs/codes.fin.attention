inflation also increases the company s interest costs and the cost of labor and materials

inflation did not have a material impact on fiscal or results 
in  delays experienced in obtaining required permits resulted in increased construction costs on the fixed price homeowner contracts which made up the company s sales backlog 
these increased costs  in turn  contributed to the decline in profit margins in both the and periods 
the company s project development schedule was changed in to ensure that communities are not open for sale as early in the development process as in the past which should minimize the potential for delays after the opening and thus the likelihood of delays in delivery once the house is sold

failure by the company to cure these defaults  revise the terms of the loan agreement or negotiate a replacement facility on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations

the company believes that the current facility as revised or replaced with a similar facility together with its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund projected near term requirements and any relevant market opportunities as well as its plans to expand its inventory of developed land
