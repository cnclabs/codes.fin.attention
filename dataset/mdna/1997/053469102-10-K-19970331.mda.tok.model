overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
the company s operations consist of the development  construction  acquisition and operation of apartment communities in the mid atlantic and northeast regions of the united states 
as of march   the company owned completed and operating communities including avalon at ballston quincy and vermont towers which were purchased on january   a general partnership interest in another community falkland chase  a equity interest including a cash flow interest in another community avalon run  a interest in a senior participating mortgage note secured by another community avalon arbor and ownership interests in communities under construction 
in total  operating communities including avalon arbor are included in the company s operating results presented herein 
in addition  the income category equity in income of joint ventures contained in the consolidated statements of operations includes income attributable to the company s share of operating income from the general partnership interest through which it holds one community falkland chase  the company s interest in avalon run  the company s effective equity interest in town close associates and of the operating income from the anticipated avalon grove joint venture to be formed upon completion of construction a development community 
the company s investment in the senior participating mortgage note relating to the avalon arbor community is presented as an investment in real estate in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
results of operations the changes in operating results from period to period are primarily the result of increases in the number of apartment homes owned due to the development and acquisition of additional communities 
where appropriate  comparisons are made on a weighted average basis for the number of occupied apartment homes in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes 
for stabilized communities  all occupied apartment homes owned are included in the calculation of weighted average occupied apartment homes for each reporting period 
for communities in the initial lease up phase  only apartment homes that are completed and occupied are included in the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes calculation for each reporting period 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  the company s principal markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and restrictive zoning regulations and it often requires several years to obtain entitlements to build an apartment community 
for this reason  little new rental product has been added in the company s principal markets in recent years 
for the markets north of maryland  management is not aware of any significant level of planned apartment construction starts 
for the washington  dc metropolitan area  permitting activity has increased  with  apartment homes in planning for delivery over the next month period 
estimated absorption during this period totals  apartment homes  which would create a supply demand balance that would be favorable for owners of multifamily apartment communities 
at december   management had positioned the company s portfolio of stabilized communities to a physical occupancy level of and for the year ended december   these communities achieved an average economic occupancy of 
average economic occupancy for the portfolio in was 
this high occupancy was achieved through aggressive marketing efforts combined with limited and targeted pricing adjustments 
this positioning has resulted in overall growth in rental revenue from stabilized communities 
it is management s strategy to maximize total rental revenue through management of rental rates and occupancy levels 
if market and economic conditions change  management may adopt a strategy of maximizing rental rates  which could lead to lower occupancy levels  if management believes that this strategy will maximize rental revenue 
given the currently high occupancy level of the portfolio  management anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  rental revenue and net income gains from stabilized communities will continue primarily through higher rental rates and enhanced operating cost leverage provided by high occupancy  rather than through occupancy gains 
although management believes the current occupancy levels can be sustained for the foreseeable future at current rental rates  no assurance can be given in this regard 
income before gain on sale of communities and extraordinary items increased  from  in to  in the principal reasons for this increase are additional operating income from newly completed and acquired communities during and as well as growth in operating income from existing communities resulting principally from increases in rental revenue 
property level ebitda for established communities increased by  to  from  as a result of a increase in total revenue and a increase in operating expenses 
the notable reasons for these increases are discussed in the following paragraphs 
rental income increased  to  in from  in of this increase   relates to established communities and  is attributable to newly completed or acquired apartment homes 
overall portfolio the  increase in rental income is primarily due to increases in the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes as well as an increase in the weighted average monthly rental income per occupied apartment home 
the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased from  apartment homes during to  apartment homes during as a result of the development and acquisition of new communities 
weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased from in to in average economic occupancy decreased 
from in to in established communities weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased from in to in average economic occupancy decreased 
from to 
accordingly  rental revenue from established communities increased  from  in to  in when combined with other income from established communities  total revenue from established communities increased by  in  a increase from management fees decreased  to  in from  in the decrease is primarily due to a decline in the number of apartment homes managed for third party owners in this decline is due to the sale and cancellation of management contracts of some third party communities in and as well as the acquisition of two current communities in the third quarter of and one current community in the second quarter of that were previously managed by the company for third party owners prior to their acquisition 
management has decided not to aggressively pursue new fee management business at this time 
new fee management business will be accepted in cases where it is profitable and where it presents a possible acquisition opportunity 
this creates a very selective environment under which new fee management business will be added  which the company anticipates will result in an overall decline in this revenue source in the future 
operating expenses including write off of deferred development costs increased  to  in from  in overall portfolio this increase is due to the acquisition of new communities as well as the completion of development communities whereby maintenance  property taxes  insurance and other costs are expensed as such communities move from the initial construction and lease up phase to the operating phase 
the increased costs of snow removal and other weather related expenses as a result of the severe winter during the first quarter of also contributed to the increase 
established communities operating expenses increased  to  from  in this increase was concentrated in the maintenance category partially due to the severe winter weather throughout the northeast and mid atlantic regions during the first quarter of as well as increases in the property taxes for newly stabilized development communities and marketing expenses 
interest expense decreased  to  in from  in this decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of  shares of the company s common stock  the sale of  shares of the company s series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock and the sale of  shares of the company s series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock in  as the net cash proceeds from the sales were used principally to retire indebtedness under the company s unsecured facilities  variable rate construction loans and to repay the mortgage note encumbering the avalon at carter lake community 
lower short term interest rates under the unsecured facilities due to negotiated rate reductions achieved as well as lower libor rates also contributed to the decline 
finally  an increase in capitalized interest expense due to an increase in the number of apartment homes under construction and lower interest and credit enhancement costs in connection with the completion of the tax exempt  credit enhancement facility with fannie mae are other reasons for the overall decline 
depreciation and amortization increased  to  in from  in this increase reflects additional depreciation expense for recently acquired and developed communities and the amortization of the costs related to the issuance of tax exempt custodial receipts in may as well as the costs related to the closing of the unsecured facility and the issuance of  of unsecured senior notes in september  offset by lower amortization expense due to the new fannie mae credit enhancement facility 
general and administrative increased  to  in from  in this increase is primarily due to the introduction of the restricted stock grant program under the amended and restated equity incentive plan and related legal and proxy costs as well as staff additions related to growth in the company s portfolio and the implementation of the company wide systems enhancement program 
equity in income of joint ventures increased  to  in from  in this increase is principally the result of non recurring income from the anticipated avalon grove joint venture in which the company is allocated of the lease up period income 
increased net income from the falkland partners joint venture due to an increase in rental revenue as well as the income from the town close associates joint venture that was formed in june also contributed to the increase 
gain on sale of communities totaled  during as a result of the sale of two apartment communities near hartford  connecticut 
extraordinary items totaled  during and reflect the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of tax exempt bonds in conjunction with the completion of the new credit enhancement facility with fannie mae 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  income before gain on sale of communities and extraordinary items increased  from income of  in to income of  in the principal reasons for this increase are increased operating income from newly completed or acquired communities during and as well as growth in operating income from existing communities 
property level ebitda for established communities increased by  to  from  as a result of a increase in total revenue  and a increase in operating expenses 
the notable reasons for these increases are discussed in the following paragraphs 
rental income increased  to  in from  in of such increase   related to established communities and  was attributable to newly completed or acquired apartment homes 
overall portfolio the  increase in rental income was primarily due to increases in the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes as well as an increase in the weighted average monthly rental income per occupied apartment home 
the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased from  apartment homes during to  apartment homes during as a result of the development and acquisition of new communities and increased overall occupancy from established communities 
weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased from to average economic occupancy increased 
from in to in established communities weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased from in to in average economic occupancy increased to from 
increased rental rates and occupancy combined to generate a total revenue increase from established communities of  in  a increase from management fees decreased  to  in from  in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of apartment homes managed for third party owners due to the cancellation of management contracts as well as the acquisition of three current communities that were managed by the company prior to their acquisition 
operating expenses including write off of deferred development costs increased  to  in from  in overall portfolio this increase was due to the acquisition of new communities as well as the completion of development communities whereby maintenance  property taxes  insurance and other costs are expensed as such communities move from the initial construction and lease up phase to the operating phase  and increased costs of maintenance as communities stabilize and mature 
operating expenses including the write off of deferred development costs as a percentage of total revenue declined to in from in  reflecting favorable operating cost leverage and cost containment 
established communities operating expenses increased  to  from  in this increase was concentrated in the maintenance  property taxes  and payroll categories and was partially offset by decreases in insurance and utilities costs 
interest expense increased  to  in from  in the increase was primarily attributable to higher average outstanding balances and interest rates under the unsecured facility  higher weighted average interest rates on floating rate tax exempt debt and incremental interest on the issuance of  and  of tax exempt debt and  of unsecured senior notes in july  may and september  respectively 
depreciation and amortization increased  to  in from  in the increase reflects additional depreciation expense for recently acquired and developed communities and the amortization of the costs related to the issuance of tax exempt bonds in july  tax exempt custodial receipts in may as well as the costs related to the closing of the unsecured facility and the issuance of  of unsecured senior notes in september general and administrative increased  to  in from  in this increase reflects staff additions necessary to manage growth in the company  the cost of one additional independent director and the introduction of the equity incentive plan and related legal and proxy costs 
equity in income of joint ventures decreased  to  in from  in the decrease was principally the result of non recurring income from the avalon run joint venture during in which the company was allocated of the lease up period income 
interest income increased  to  in from  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in average interest rates earned on invested cash balances between years  offset by lower average cash balances 
extraordinary items totaled  during and reflect the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of the secured revolving credit facility 
discussion of capitalized community improvements and expensed turnover make ready costs the company maintains a policy with respect to capital expenditures that generally provides that only non recurring expenditures are capitalized 
improvements and upgrades are capitalized only if the item exceeds  extends the useful life of the asset and is not related to making an apartment ready for the next resident 
under this policy  virtually all capitalized costs are non recurring  as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred  including costs of carpet and appliance replacements  floor coverings  interior painting and other redecorating costs 
the application of this policy in resulted in capitalized expenditures for established communities of approximately per apartment home plus an additional per apartment home that was revenue generating 
for the year ended december   the company charged to maintenance expense  including carpet and appliance replacements  a total of approximately million for established communities 
management anticipates that capitalized costs per home will gradually rise as the company s portfolio of communities matures 
the following is a summary of expenditures for both recurring make ready costs expensed and community upgrades capitalized for expenditures for community and corporate upgrades capitalized and community maintenance expensed dollars in thousands  except per home data maintenance capitalized upgrades expensed number balance at balance at community of homes total per home total per home stabilized avalon park    avalon at ballston washington towers   avalon at gayton   avalon at symphony glen    avalon at hampton i    avalon at hampton ii   avalon at dulles    avalon knoll    avalon lea   avalon at fairway hills i    avalon ridge    longwood towers    avalon farm   avalon glen    avalon pavilions   avalon view    massachusetts ave

excludes falkland chase and avalon run  apartment homes owned by joint ventures in which the company holds a interest and interest  respectively 
represents renovation costs incurred 
sold in liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
a primary source of liquidity to the company is cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows have historically been determined by the number of apartment homes  rental rates  occupancy levels and the company s expenses with respect to such apartment homes 
the company regularly reviews short term liquidity needs and the adequacy of funds from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
the company believes that its principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring operating expenses  debt service requirements and the minimum distribution required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the code 
the company anticipates that these needs will be fully funded from cash flows provided by operating activities 
any short term liquidity needs not provided by current operating cash flows would be funded from the company s unsecured facilities 
cash flows used in investing activities and provided by financing activities have historically been dependent on the number of apartment homes under active development and construction during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents increased  from  at december  to  at december  due to the excess of cash provided by financing and operating activities over cash flow used in investing activities  primarily due to the issuance of  of equity and debt securities in and the sale of two communities in the fourth quarter of net cash provided by operating activities increased  from  to  primarily due to an increase in operating income from newly developed and acquired communities and established communities 
net cash flows used in investing activities increased  from  to  due to an increase in the number of apartment homes under development from an average of  in to  in and the acquisition of six communities for  in compared to the acquisition of seven communities for  in  offset by the net proceeds of  from the sale of two apartment communities in net cash provided by financing activities increased  from  to  primarily due to the net proceeds received from the completion of the sales of  shares of the company s common stock and the sale of  shares of the company s series a and series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock in and increased borrowings under the unsecured facilities  offset by an increase in dividends paid 
cash and cash equivalents decreased  from  at december  to  at december  due to the excess of cash used in investing activities over cash flow provided by operating and financing activities  primarily due to the acquisition and development of new communities as more fully described below net cash provided by operating activities increased  from  to  primarily due to an increase in operating income from newly developed and acquired communities as well as established communities 
the transfer of previously segregated resident security deposits for communities located in virginia provided a  increase in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
the company determined that security deposits related to assets owned in virginia need not be maintained in restricted accounts 
the release of these funds was used to repay balances outstanding under the unsecured facility 
cash flows used in investing activities increased  from  to  due to an increase in the number of apartment homes under development from an average of  in to  in net cash provided by financing activities increased  from  to  due to the excess net proceeds received from the issuance of  in unsecured tax exempt custodial receipts and  in unsecured senior notes in over the proceeds received from the completion of the company s second public offering and the refunding of tax exempt bonds in  offset by an increase in dividends paid and deferred financing costs 
at december   permanent mortgage indebtedness will require balloon payments of principal amounts of indebtedness coming due over the years through  including  in and  in additionally  bonds and related interest reserves requiring remarketing or that have expiring credit enhancements total  in certain of these payments may be accelerated upon the termination of credit enhancements if such credit enhancements are not renewed or replaced 
since management anticipates that only a small portion of the principal of such indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity and the company may not have funds on hand sufficient to repay such indebtedness  it may be necessary for the company to refinance this debt 
such refinancing could be accomplished through additional debt financing  which may be collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
capital resources 
to sustain the company s active development and acquisitions program  continuous access to the capital markets is required 
management intends to match the long term nature of its real estate assets with long term cost effective capital 
historically  the company has demonstrated regular and continuous access to the capital markets since the initial offering  raising approximately million in six offerings over a twenty month period and over million during these offerings include date description of offering july million tax exempt bond offering august million public offering of common stock may million tax exempt unsecured custodial receipts offering september million unsecured senior notes offering january million direct placement of common stock to certain institutional investors february million series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock offering october million series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock offering december million public offering of common stock management intends to operate in a manner that will permit future access to the capital markets and intends to follow a focused strategy to help ensure uninterrupted access to capital 
this strategy includes hire  train and retain associates with a strong resident service focus  which should lead to higher rents  lower turnover and reduced operating costs  manage  acquire and develop institutional quality communities with in fill locations that should provide consistent  sustained earnings growth  operate in markets with growing demand as measured by household formation and job growth and high barriers to entry 
these characteristics combine to provide a favorable demand supply balance  creating a favorable environment for future rental rate growth while protecting existing and new communities from new supply 
this strategy is expected to result in a high level of quality to the revenue stream  maintain a conservative capital structure largely comprised of equity and modest  cost effective leverage 
secured debt should generally be avoided and used primarily to secure low cost  tax exempt debt 
such a structure should promote an environment for ratings upgrades that can lead to a lower cost of capital  timely  accurate and detailed disclosures to the investment community  conservative accounting practices that provide a high level of quality to reported earnings 
management believes that following these strategies provides a disciplined approach to capital access that is expected to ensure that capital resources are available to fund portfolio growth 
the following is a discussion of specific capital transactions  arrangements and agreements that are important to the capital resources of the company 
unsecured facilities in january  the company arranged a year  supplemental unsecured facility provided by first union national bank in the amount of  in september  pricing on the company s unsecured facilities was reduced 
the consortium of banks providing the company s unsecured facility lowered the interest rate charged under the facility to libor plus from libor plus 
pricing under the supplemental credit facility was reduced to libor plus 
from libor plus 
current pricing level under the unsecured facility is 
interest rate protection agreements the company entered into an interest rate protection agreement in the form of an accreting  swap transaction the swap with a triple a counterparty the counterparty on may  the swap serves to fix the floating component of the company s total interest rate at on notional amounts which increase over time 
on the th day of each month during the term of the agreement  the company will pay to the counterparty interest equal to on the then principal amount in effect  divided by twelve months 
the principal amount in effect during ranged from million in january to million in december 
the counterparty will pay to the company interest equal to the actual day libor rate on the then principal amount in effect  divided by twelve months 
payments made by the company under the swap totaled  for the year ended december  the swap terminated in february the company was not a party to any long term interest rate agreements in  other than the swap described above 
the company intends  however  to evaluate the need for additional long term interest rate protection agreements as interest rate market conditions dictate and has engaged a consultant to assist in managing the company s interest rate risks and exposure 
financing transactions completed on january   the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock to certain institutional investors under its existing shelf registration statement at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  the net cash proceeds from the sale approximately  were used to retire indebtedness under the company s unsecured facility

the gross proceeds of the offering totaled  the net cash proceeds from the sale approximately  were used to retire indebtedness under the company s unsecured facility  variable rate construction loans and for general corporate purposes 
on august   the company completed a new tax exempt credit enhancement facility with fannie mae that provides a long term  cost effective credit enhancement source for the company s current and future tax exempt bond debt 
in connection with this facility  the company completed the refinancing of approximately  of its tax exempt bond debt 
the facility involves eleven communities  seven that are financed with tax exempt bonds and four unencumbered communities that are pledged as additional collateral 
on october   the company completed an offering of  shares including  shares sold in connection with the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option of series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
the net cash proceeds from the sale approximately  were used to retire indebtedness under the company s unsecured facilities 
on december   the company completed a public offering of  shares including  shares sold in connection with the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the net cash proceeds from the sale approximately  were used primarily to repay amounts outstanding under the unsecured facilities  to fund the acquisition and development of additional apartment communities and to use for general working capital purposes 
registration statements filed in connection with financings on january   the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering up to  of securities 
the registration statement provides for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock  and was used in connection with the february  and october  offerings of preferred stock and the december  offering of common stock 
the remaining amount available under this registration statement was carried forward into the registration statement filed on february  and accordingly  no capacity remains under the registration statement filed on january  on february   the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering up to  of securities 
the registration statement provides for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock 
financing commitments the company has received a commitment for tax exempt financing on the avalon fields development community 
the community development administration of maryland has issued million of thirty year fixed rate bonds related to avalon fields  at an all in rate of 
management expects to complete documentation and receive funding of approximately million in march future financing needs substantially all of the capital expenditures to complete the communities currently under construction will be funded from proceeds of permanent and construction financing commitments already in place or by the unsecured facilities  and little  if any  additional capital sources are needed to complete the communities 
except for longwood towers  the company has no present plans for any major capital improvements to any of the current communities 
the renovation of longwood towers is being funded by advances under the unsecured facilities  operating cash flow or other financing sources over a three year period 
management expects to continue to fund deferred development costs related to future developments from funds from operations and advances under the unsecured facilities 
the company believes that these sources of capital are adequate to take each of the proposed communities to the point in the development cycle where construction can commence 
management anticipates that available borrowing capacity under the unsecured facilities and funds from operations will be adequate to meet future expenditures required to commence construction of each of the development rights 
in addition  the company currently anticipates funding construction of some but not all of the development rights under the expected remaining capacity of the unsecured facilities 
however  before the construction of a development right commences  the company intends  if necessary  to issue additional equity or debt securities  arrange additional capacity under the unsecured facilities or future credit facilities or obtain additional construction loan commitments not currently in place to ensure that adequate liquidity sources are in place to fund the construction of a development right  although no assurance can be given in this regard

funds from operations management generally considers funds from operations to be an appropriate measure of the operating performance of the company 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the operating results of the company  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with the net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report
