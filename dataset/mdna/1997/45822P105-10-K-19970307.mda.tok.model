item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  at page  for a discussion of accounting developments 
the staff of the u 
s 
securities and exchange commission has questioned certain of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition  measurement  and classification of nuclear decommissioning costs for nuclear generation facilities in the financial statements of electric utilities 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board has agreed to review the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs 
if current electric utility industry accounting practices for such decommissioning are changed  the annual provisions for decommissioning could increase and the estimated cost for decommissioning could be recorded as a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation 
wpsc does not believe that such changes  if required  would have an adverse effect on results of operations due to its current and future ability to recover decommissioning costs through customer rates 
the pscw certified new straight line depreciation rates which became effective january  and remain in effect 
the pscw s february rate order also provided for the accelerated funding of kewaunee decommissioning costs and the accelerated recovery of the remaining investment in the plant such that both would be complete by the end of the year this treatment of kewaunee expenses recognizes the uncertain future of nuclear generation 
see part i  item b  electric matters kewaunee nuclear power plant  at page  for an extended discussion of this development 
regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs which will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process 
regulatory liabilities represent costs previously collected that are refundable in future rates 
at december   regulatory assets and liabilities amounted to million and million  respectively 
based on prior and current rate treatment of such deferred charges  management believes it is probable that wpsc will continue to recover these regulatory assets from ratepayers 
pursuant to a pscw rate order  effective february   wpsc will recover approximately million of deferred regulatory costs over the next five years 
dividend restrictions 
wpsc is restricted by a pscw order to paying normal common stock dividends of no more than of the previous year s common stock dividend without prior notice to the pscw 
also  wisconsin law prohibits wpsc from making loans to the company and its non regulated subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations 
on january  and january   special common stock dividends of  and  respectively  were declared by wpsc to be paid to the company 
the special dividends allowed wpsc s equity capitalization ratio to remain at approximately  the level approved by the pscw for ratemaking 
the dividends were paid in january and january g 
capital requirements the company s subsidiary  wpsc  requires large investments in capital assets 
most of the company s significant capital requirements relate to wpsc construction expenditures 
anticipated construction expenditures for wpsc are million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the expenditures includes million for electric construction  million for nuclear fuel  million for gas construction  and million for other construction expenditures 
included in these expenditures is million for wpsc s share of the kewaunee steam generator replacement 
anticipated investment expenditures for non utility subsidiaries could be as high as million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
although the company has no plans for permanent financings during  issuance of up to million of bonds and debentures and million of common stock sales may be necessary in and to cover wpsc s expenditures  maturing bonds  and currently forecasted non regulated projects

approximately and of the company s revenues and assets  respectively  are derived from wisconsin public service corporation wpsc  an electric and gas utility 
compared to revenues at the company increased from million in to million in net income at the company decreased from million in to million in earnings per share decreased from in to in the most significant reasons for the decrease in earnings at the company were increased operating expenses at the non regulated subsidiaries  decreased gas margins at wps energy services  inc esi  a loss on an industrial processing facility investment  and increased operating expenses at wpsc 
revenues at wpsc increased from million in to million in earnings on common stock at wpsc increased from million in to million in electric utility operations electric margins increased million see table below  or  due primarily to increased sales volumes and decreased purchased power costs 
electric margins revenues    fuel and purchased power    margins    sales kwh    the public service commission of wisconsin pscw allows wpsc to pass on to its customers  through a fuel adjustment clause  changes in the cost of fuel and purchased power within a specified range 
wpsc is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annual basis 
electric operating revenues remained relatively stable between and electric production fuels and purchased power decreased million  or  as a result of million lower purchased power costs  million lower generation costs at the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee due to an extended outage for maintenance  and million lower combustion turbine generation costs due to increased generation at wpsc s coal fired plants 
offsetting these decreases was a million increase in generation costs at coal fired plants 
gas utility operations gas margins increased million see table below  or  due to customer growth at wpsc and colder weather 
the weather was colder in than in  based on degree days 
gas margins revenues    purchase costs    margins    volume therms    the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause pgac 
gas operating revenues increased million  or  due to increased volumes as a result of customer growth and higher gas costs 
gas purchased for resale showed a net increase of million  or  due to increased volumes as a result of customer growth and higher gas costs 
non regulated operations non regulated energy and other operating revenues increased million  or 
non regulated energy revenues primarily represent the electric and gas sales of esi  an energy marketing subsidiary which began operations in the increase in non regulated energy revenues was due primarily to increased gas sales at esi from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
such increased gas sales resulted from esi s acquisition of a gas marketing company in the fourth quarter of  additional customer growth in the wholesale market  and higher unit prices due to gas commodity market conditions 
other operating revenues increased million  or  and are comprised of consulting and construction revenue from esi and wps power development  inc pdi  a company organized to participate in the development of electric generation projects and to provide services to the non regulated electric power generation industry 
non regulated energy cost of sales increased million  or  due primarily to increased gas purchases and increased gas costs at esi from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
negative gas margins on esi sales were due primarily to the volatile gas commodity market experienced during in which esi was not fully hedged for its customer commitments and esi s decision to honor customer contracts  despite defaults by certain gas suppliers  during a period of exceptionally high demand 
other expenses other operating expenses increased million  or 
at esi and pdi  there was a million increase in expenses reflecting the expansion of their businesses and the development of infrastructure including personnel and systems 
included in other operating expenses at wpsc was an increase of million related to expansion of certain operating activities in anticipation of more competitive markets and an increase in gas operating expenses of million as a result of customer growth 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in employee benefit costs of approximately million due to a reduction in post retirement benefit expenses 
maintenance expense decreased million  or  due to lower maintenance activity at wpsc s coal fired plants of million 
this decrease was partially offset by increased maintenance expense at kewaunee of million 
other income decreased million  or  reflecting a million loss on an industrial processing facility investment which had been made in anticipation of energy sales opportunities 
compared to earnings per share increased from in to in the most significant reasons for this change were higher electric margins due to burning less expensive low sulfur coal and increased sales volume 
electric utility operations electric margins increased million  or  due primarily to increased sales volumes and decreased coal costs which were partially offset by a wisconsin retail rate reduction effective january  electric operating revenues increased million  or 
electric revenues were higher due to a increase in kilowatt hour kwh sales 
this was partially offset by a decrease in wisconsin retail rates that took effect on january  residential kwh sales and commercial and industrial kwh sales increased and  respectively  due to warmer summer weather and customer growth 
wholesale kwh sales decreased 
due primarily to lower demand by wpsc s largest wholesale customer 
electric fuels and purchases decreased million  or 
coal related costs decreased million  or  due to burning less expensive low sulfur coal 
however  this was partially offset by increased coal fired generation expenses of million  or  and higher purchased power expense of million  or  due to warmer weather and increased plant outages resulting from maintenance at certain plants 
gas utility operations gas margins increased million  or  due to customer growth at wpsc and colder weather 
gas operating revenues decreased million  or  due to lower gas costs 
gas purchased for resale showed a net decrease of million  or  due to lower gas costs 
non regulated operations non regulated energy and other operating revenues increased million  or  due to increased sales at esi and increased consulting  construction  and investment revenue of 
million from esi and pdi 
non regulated energy cost of sales increased million or due to increased gas purchases at esi 
other expenses other operating expenses increased million  or 
the majority of this increase is attributable to increased operating expenses at esi and pdi 
depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million or 
there were two primary reasons for this increase 
the first factor was an increase in decommissioning funding of million that was reflected in customer rates which became effective january  the second factor was additional decommissioning expense recorded to offset a million gain on the decommissioning portfolio discussed below and higher trust earnings of million 
there were three significant non recurring items impacting other income in first  a pretax gain of million was realized on the decommissioning portfolio from the sale of certain investments 
second  insurance proceeds of million were received as the result of the death of a retired wpsc executive 
third  these gains were partially offset by a million loss resulting from cancellation of the rhinelander energy center project 
balance sheet compared to nuclear decommissioning trusts increased million due to continued funding and favorable investment returns 
customer receivables and accounts payable increased million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of business growth at esi 
gas in storage increased million as a result of an increase in the cost of gas at both wpsc and esi 
regulatory assets decreased million due to amortization of deferred conservation expenses and final amortization and recovery of the retail portion of deferred coal contract buyouts 
net non utility and non regulated plant increased million due to increased non utility assets at wpsc and the purchase of a merchant generating facility by pdi 
investments and other assets increased million as a result of increased prepaid pension assets 
short term notes payable and commercial paper increased million and million  respectively  due to increased operational cash needs at esi and refinancing million of wpsc s first mortgage bonds  series  due in  with short term borrowings 
gas refunds decreased million as wpsc has returned the majority of these refunds to its customers 
other long term liabilities increased million due to reduced funding of the post retirement medical liability and increased customer advances for construction at wpsc 
in connection with its purchase of the stoneman power plant  pdi recorded a long term liability to the seller 
financial condition wpsc wpsc requires large investments in capital assets used to deliver electric and gas services 
as a result  most of the company s capital requirements relate to wpsc s construction expenditures 
wpsc maintains good liquidity levels and a financial condition considered to be strong by analysts 
internally generated funds closely approximate the utility s cash requirements 
no external funding difficulties are anticipated 
pre tax interest coverage was times for the year ended december  wpsc s bond ratings are aa standard poor s  aa moody s  and aa duff phelps 
wpsc is restricted by a pscw order from paying normal common stock dividends of more than of the previous year s common stock dividends without pscw approval 
also  wisconsin law prohibits wpsc from making loans to the company and its subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations 
a special common stock dividend of million was paid by wpsc to the company in january the special dividend allows wpsc s average equity capitalization ratio to remain at approximately  the level approved by the pscw for ratemaking 
anticipated construction expenditures for wpsc are million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the expenditures include million for electric construction  million for nuclear fuel  million for gas construction  and million for other construction 
included in these expenditures is million for wpsc s share of the kewaunee steam generator replacement 
anticipated investment expenditures for the non regulated subsidiaries could be as high as million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
although the company has no plans for permanent financing in  up to million of bonds and debentures and million of common stock sales may be necessary during and to finance wpsc s expenditures  maturing bonds  and currently forecasted non regulated projects 
in the second quarter of  wpsc repurchased million of first mortgage bonds  series  due in this repurchase was funded through short term borrowings 
in early  wps leasing  inc  a subsidiary of wpsc  purchased an additional unit train for approximately million 
this purchase was partially funded with a long term note from the company 
as of december   the loan balance was million and it carried an interest rate of 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  became effective in march this statement imposes a stricter criterion for regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date 
the company adopted this standard on january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations based on the current regulatory structure 
sfas no 
may impact the company in the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in the electric and gas industries and as regulatory policy regarding recovery of stranded investment is developed 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  became effective in this statement permits  but does not require  companies to change their accounting for stock based compensation 
the statement also requires additional disclosures 
the company has adopted only the disclosure provision of the statement and currently does not provide significant stock based compensation 
plans to construct the rhinelander energy center were cancelled in as a result of this cancellation  wpsc signed a year agreement in november to purchase power from polsky energy corporation polsky  an independent power producer proposing to build a plant adjacent to the nicolet paper company mill in de pere  wisconsin 
polsky is in the second stage of a two stage certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn permitting process prescribed by the pscw 
construction of the polsky project is contingent upon a pscw determination in stage two of the cpcn process that wpsc will need the electric capacity which would be provided by the proposed plant 
a recent wpsc load forecast suggests the capacity may not be needed 
a final decision is expected in if the pscw approves the polsky project  it will be accounted for as a capitalized lease 
this would result in the recording of a plant asset of approximately million  with an offsetting amount of long term debt 
in  wpsc entered into a competitively priced contract with a new wholesale customer to provide fixed price power over a ten year period 
the pscw did not agree with establishing contract pricing based on anything other than fully allocated costs 
subsequently  wpsc entered into an arrangement with an outside party to fulfill most of the customer s requirements for this contract and thereby mitigate any regulatory exposure 
the pscw did not recognize the subsequent agreement and  as part of the rate decision which will become effective in  has assumed full cost allocation pricing that ignores the outside party s sales to the customer when determining new wisconsin retail rates 
if the pscw continues to take this position  the impact over the next years could be a reduction in wisconsin retail revenues of up to a maximum of million 
management does not agree with the pscw decision and plans to work with the pscw to demonstrate that the pscw method of allocating costs for this wholesale customer should be changed so that there is no negative impact on wisconsin retail revenues 
trends wpsc follows sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating the utility 
these include the pscw  of revenues  the michigan public service commission mpsc  of revenues  and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  of revenues 
in addition  kewaunee is regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
environmental matters are primarily governed by the environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources 
in  the company received marketer status from the ferc which gives wpsc  esi  and pdi the flexibility to sell electric energy and capacity to wholesale customers at market rates 
the single most important development in the electric utility industry is the continuing trend toward increased competition brought about by a combination of new legislation  changing regulation  new technology  and market forces 
transmission access  mandated by the energy policy act of  and increased competition in the wholesale power segment of the business have put pressure on profit margins 
certain segments of the industry could become deregulated 
low cost energy producers  such as wpsc  are in a position to benefit from competitive markets 
in april  the ferc issued order no 
which addresses both open access and stranded cost issues 
a second rule  order no 
 also issued in april  requires utilities to establish electronic systems to share information about available transmission capacity and establishes standards of conduct 
as a result of these orders  wpsc has developed and implemented strategies to deal with transmission access and potential stranded investment 
wpsc has developed a separate internal transmission group to fulfill the ferc s requirement for functional unbundling 
wpsc has also filed comparable transmission access tariffs which have been accepted for use  subject to refund 
comparable transmission access tariffs  as defined by the ferc  provide transmission access to other parties on the same terms and conditions that wpsc provides transmission service to itself 
wpsc is participating in the midwest independent system operator iso initiative  a group of midwestern utilities who are designing an iso concept for transmission service in the region 
in december  the pscw outlined its plan for restructuring the electric industry in wisconsin 
the plan includes steps in a year process concluding with retail competition by the year certain aspects of the plan will require state legislative changes 
the wisconsin legislature is expected to consider electric restructuring in in the meantime  the pscw  utility companies  various advocacy groups  and utility customers will continue to dialogue in an effort to reach a consensus on when and how to comply with the pscw introduced plan for restructuring the electric industry 
changes in the regulation of the natural gas business on the federal level prompted the pscw to examine the future regulation of the natural gas distribution business in wisconsin 
in  the pscw issued orders defining the level of interruption testing required for interruptible gas customers  modifying the presently required pgac which allows total recovery of gas supply and capacity costs to allow for other gas supply and capacity cost recovery mechanisms  determining whether utilities and their affiliated marketers should be required to have separate resources for gas purchases and sales  or if allocation of common resources between these two entities is adequate  and defining a generic set of standards of conduct for the state s utilities and their affiliates 
the pscw also opened a docket to determine the definition of a competitive market  as well as the steps necessary to mitigate barriers to competition in wisconsin 
wpsc has historically recovered gas costs through a pgac 
the pscw is examining the appropriateness of the pgac and issued an order in november concluding that the majority of state gas utilities must use either an incentive gas cost recovery mechanism or a modified pgac mechanism 
wpsc is evaluating its options and will adjust its gas cost recovery mechanism accordingly 
the mpsc initiated a similar process to address gas industry restructuring by forming a committee of interested parties to consider changes in the gas cost recovery mechanism  service unbundling  curtailment issues  and storage issues 
the mpsc issued a final document indicating consensus on the identification of the issues but not on the resolution of the issues 
as a result of the changes occurring in the electric industry  several mergers have been announced in the region and are in various stages of the regulatory approval process 
wpsc is currently investigating the need for environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites which it previously operated 
wpsc engaged an environmental consultant to develop cleanup cost estimates for the seven sites at which either a phase i or phase ii site investigation had been completed 
the consultant has yet to perform a detailed investigation of the eighth site  and comparable information on this site is not available 
the range of future investigation and cleanup costs for all eight sites is estimated to be from million to million 
minimal amounts have been spent to date 
remediation expenditures would be made over the next years 
wpsc has recorded a liability with an offsetting regulatory asset deferred charge which represents wpsc s current estimate of cleanup costs for all eight sites 
based on discussions with regulators and a rate order in wisconsin  management believes that these costs net of any insurance recoveries  but not the carrying costs associated with the expenditures  will be recoverable in future customer rates 
as remedial feasibility studies and initial remedial actions are completed  these estimates may be adjusted and these adjustments could be significant 
other factors that can affect these estimates are changes in remedial technology and regulatory requirements 
the estimates presented above do not take into consideration any recovery from insurance carriers or other third parties which wpsc has obtained or is pursuing 
insurance recoveries are deferred as an offset to the regulatory asset 
due to the regulatory treatment  neither adjustments to the estimated liability nor insurance recoveries have an immediate impact on net income 
currently  wpsc has insurance settlement agreements of approximately million which it expects to receive in the pscw has authorized recovery of  per year for gas site cleanup effective with the rate order which is expected to become effective in february in addition  wpsc has been notified that it is a minor participant in a number of waste disposal site cleanup efforts 
however  no significant costs are anticipated to clean up these sites 
federal clean air act amendments the act were enacted in the act establishes stringent sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission limitations 
wisconsin previously had enacted laws to limit sulfur emissions 
wpsc currently meets the sulfur dioxide emission standards scheduled to take effect in the year as a result of switching to lower sulfur fuels 
however  some additional capital expenditures related to nitrogen oxide emissions will be required to upgrade existing equipment and to monitor emission levels 
these expenditures are estimated to be in the range from million to million between and in  wpsc initiated a new demand side management dsm program which involves loans and shared savings 
the new program provides that those who participate and directly benefit from energy saving programs will pay for the cost of the programs 
prior to  dsm expenditures were recovered from all customers through their electric and gas retail rates 
as of december   wpsc had million of deferred dsm expenditures which will be recovered in future customer rates 
kewaunee was taken out of service on september  for scheduled refueling and maintenance 
inspection of previously repaired steam generator tubes disclosed more extensive tube degradation than had been anticipated 
repair of the tubes using laser welding was undertaken 
as of december   it was anticipated that repairs would be completed sometime during the first quarter of welding was completed late in january subsequent testing indicated that repair of a number of the tubes was not effective 
the return of kewaunee to service will be delayed while additional repair efforts are undertaken 
nrc approval of the process is needed to restart the plant 
it is unknown how long steam generator repairs and nrc approval of the steam generator repair process will take 
it is uncertain when kewaunee will return to service with repaired steam generators 
if for any reason the steam generators cannot be repaired  the ability of the kewaunee owners to reach consensus on steam generator replacement and to secure the approval of the pscw for such replacement would become critical factors affecting the duration of the current outage because  in that case  replacement of the steam generators would be essential for the continued operation of kewaunee 
the elapsed time from placing a firm steam generator order to receiving delivery of replacement steam generators is months 
even if the repairs are successful and the plant restarts  the tube repairs are expected to last only a few years 
therefore  kewaunee would be retired significantly prior to the expiration of the operating license in unless the steam generators are replaced 
if kewaunee returns to service  it would be shut down at mid cycle within one year after being returned to service for tube inspection 
if significant further tube degradation would be discovered during the mid cycle shutdown  the nrc may not permit kewaunee to continue to operate without replacement of the steam generators 
since the earliest date by which the steam generators could be replaced is sometime in  a mid cycle shutdown and subsequent requirement that the steam generators be replaced before startup could result in an extended outage 
an extended kewaunee outage subjects wpsc to the possibility of increased fuel and purchased power costs 
wpsc could incur up to million in the first quarter of for its share of kewaunee steam generator tube repair costs 
in addition  the cost to use other generating units or to purchase replacement power is expected to exceed the cost of kewaunee generated power by approximately  a day 
the effectiveness  timing  and cost of repairs and the cost of replacement power are subject to a number of uncertainties including the duration of the outage 
wpsc anticipates receipt of a rate order in the wisconsin jurisdiction effective in february the order is expected to provide a million per month surcharge on customer bills to cover the additional costs to be incurred by wpsc for acquiring power from other sources while kewaunee remains out of service 
wpsc anticipates that it will have sufficient capacity to meet its customers energy requirements during the outage 
the joint owners of kewaunee continue to evaluate the economics of whether or not to invest approximately million to replace the steam generators 
replacement must also be approved by the pscw 
wpsc favors replacing the steam generators  while the other two joint owners do not favor replacement 
wpsc requested and was granted regulatory approval to accelerate the recovery of the wisconsin retail portion of the current undepreciated kewaunee plant balance and the unfunded estimated costs to decommission the plant over a six year period beginning in if kewaunee is retired early  wpsc believes it would be granted regulatory approval to recover from customers the net carrying amount and the estimated costs to decommission kewaunee in excess of the trust assets 
at december   the net carrying amount was approximately million 
the current cost of wpsc s share of the estimated costs to decommission kewaunee  assuming early retirement  exceeds the trust assets at december  by million 
if kewaunee is retired early  wpsc believes that it will be able to meet its commitments to supply energy to its customers through either possible investments in new generating units  contracting for additional purchased power  or changes in commitments to serve its customers if the generation business is deregulated 
if wpsc increases its investment in kewaunee and the steam generators are replaced  wpsc believes kewaunee costs would be recoverable in a competitive generation market 
wpsc anticipates receipt of a rate order in the wisconsin jurisdiction effective in february the impact is approximately a million decrease in electric revenues and a million increase in gas revenues on an annual basis 
the new rates will be effective for and a brief summary of the more significant rate case decisions and their estimated impacts follows 
wpsc will be granted a million per month surcharge on customer bills to cover the additional costs to be incurred by wpsc for acquiring power from other sources while kewaunee remains out of service 
the pscw is also expected to reaffirm its decision to allow wpsc to accelerate the funding of decommissioning and the recovery of investment for kewaunee assuming a year shutdown 
the total dollar impact of this acceleration results in an million annual increase in wpsc s customer rates 
wpsc will be granted an return on equity for and the pscw has also agreed to allow wpsc to file a rate case should wpsc experience severe detrimental financial conditions as a result of the constraints placed on it by the rate order 
impact of inflation the company s current financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
they provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wpsc s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because forecasts are prepared assuming inflation  the majority of inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wpsc is only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation
