such factors include  but are not limited to  the following customer concentration  strategic alliance with igt 
the company s strategic alliance with igt has increased the company s dependence on igt as a customer and as a distributor of the company s products 
failure by igt to meet the company s expectation for sales or payment could have a material adverse effect on the company 
proprietary games 
the creation of proprietary games and the deployment of those games into casinos on a revenue sharing basis is a key part of the company s business plan and its strategic alliance with igt 
the company may not be able to develop successful proprietary games or convince casinos to implement such games on a revenue sharing basis 
government regulation  potential restrictions on sales 
the company is subject to gaming regulations in each jurisdiction in which its products are sold or are used by persons licensed to conduct gaming activities 
the company s products generally are regulated as associated equipment  pursuant to which gaming regulators have discretion to subject the company  its officers  directors  key employees  other affiliates  and certain shareholders to licensing  approval and suitability requirements 
in the event that gaming authorities determine that any person is unsuitable to act in such capacity  the company would be required to terminate its relationship with such person  and under certain circumstances  the company has the right to redeem its securities from persons who are found unsuitable 
products offered and expected to be offered by the company include features that are not available on products currently in use 
these new features may  in some cases  result in additional regulatory review and licensing requirements for the products or the company 
compliance with such regulatory requirements may be time consuming and expensive  and may delay or prevent a sale in one or more jurisdictions 
in addition  associated equipment generally must be approved by the regulatory authorities for use by each licensed location within the jurisdiction  regardless of whether the company is subject to licensing  approval  or suitability requirements 
failure by the company to obtain  or the loss or suspension of  any necessary licenses  approvals or suitability findings  may prevent the company from selling or distributing its product in such jurisdiction 
such results may have a material adverse effect on the company 
from time to time  the company enters into contracts that are contingent upon the company and or the customer obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to sell or use the company s products or to operate a casino 
failure to timely obtain such approvals may result in the termination of the contract and the return of amounts paid pursuant to such contract 
changes in business and economic conditions generally and in the gaming industry 
the strength and profitability of the company s business depends on the overall demand for bonusing products and growth in the gaming industry 
gaming industry revenues are sensitive to general economic conditions and generally rise or fall more rapidly in relation to the condition of the overall economy 
in a period of reduced demand  the company may not be able to lower its costs rapidly enough to counter a decrease in revenues 
product concentration  competition  risks of technological change 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from the sale of bonusing products and the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to continue to generate sales of these products 
a decline in demand or prices for the company s bonusing products  whether as a result of new product introduction or price competition from competitors  technological change  or failure of the company s bonusing products to address customer requirements or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive and subject to frequent technological changes and one or more of the company s competitors may develop alternative technologies for bonusing or game promotions 
the company s future results of operations will depend in part upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
while the company expends a significant portion of its revenues on research and development and on product enhancement  the company may not be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products  or technological developments may cause the company s products to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company and the company may not be able to compete successfully with them 
patents and trademarks 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark law  nondisclosure agreements and technical security measures to protect its products 
the company has received a us patent on certain features of its bonusing product line  has applied for additional us patents and may in the future apply for other us patents and corresponding foreign patents 
the company may also file for patents on certain features of products that the company may develop in the future 
notwithstanding these safeguards  it is possible for competitors of the company to obtain its trade secrets and to imitate its products 
furthermore  others may independently develop products similar or superior to those developed or planned by the company 
while the company may obtain patents with respect to certain of its products  the company may not have sufficient resources to defend such patents  such patents may not afford all necessary protection and competitors may develop equivalent or superior products which may not infringe such patents 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may fluctuate significantly in the future  due to a number of factors  including  among others  the size and timing of customer orders  the timing and market acceptance of new products introduced by the company  changes in the level of operating expenses  technological advances and new product introductions by the company s competitors  competitive conditions in the industry  regulatory approval and general economic conditions 
product development and marketing costs are often incurred in periods before any revenues are recognized from the sales of products  and gross margins are lower and operating expenses are higher during periods in which such product development expenses are incurred and marketing efforts are commenced 
at its current stage of operations  the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations may be materially affected by the receipt or loss of any one order and by the timing of the delivery  installation and regulatory approval of any one order 
the company may not be able to maintain profitable operations on a consistent basis 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
fluctuations in operating results may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
management of growth  liquidity 
the company has recently experienced significant growth in its business  which has placed  and if sustained will continue to place  a substantial burden on its operational  administrative and financial resources 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth would require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage its employees 
any failure by the company to implement and improve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  sufficient funds to maintain new product development efforts and expected levels of operations may not be available and additional capital  if and when needed by the company  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company
