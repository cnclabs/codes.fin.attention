item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
dollar amounts are expressed in thousands 
company overview throughout  titan continued to pursue its strategy of strengthening its core defense businesses and investing in its early stage commercial businesses 
investment dollars were provided from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debentures  proceeds of which were used to repay borrowings under its bank credit facilities and to fund working capital requirements 
significant accomplishments achieved by titan s emerging commercial businesses this year included the award of a million purchase agreement for delivery of additional conditional access system equipment and set top box decoders to a us company and a million award for a similar system in thailand  the initial shipments on the company s rural telephony development contract in indonesia  the award of a million contract to provide a communications network in bangkok  and the opening of the san diego medical sterilization facility 
these accomplishments marked significant progress for titan 
however  the need to complete product development and realize positive profit contributions from the commercialization process has heightened the challenge of internally funding these start up activities 
titan s strategic plan focuses on the pursuit of various financing alternatives including  but not limited to  public and private offerings of minority interests in certain of its subsidiaries and the sale of non core businesses  in order to provide additional funding for the development and commercialization of new products and services 
the company is currently involved in a number of early stage businesses  most notably commercial satellite communications  broadband communications  and medical device sterilization 
certain investments made in these early stage businesses have been capitalized and are included in the balance sheet  primarily within the captions of inventories  property and equipment  and other assets  which includes capitalized software costs 
at december   these capitalized investments aggregate approximately million 
these early stage businesses are in various growth stages and have not yet generated sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
the capitalized investments in these businesses are substantially complete 
however  significant sales and marketing efforts related to the commercialization process are expected to continue 
management intends to carefully monitor its return on investment from all of its early stage businesses 
the company has been pursuing a process to identify potential strategic investors for the broadband communications business 
to date  an appropriate strategic investor has not been identified 
the company intends to reduce its investment in this area in  and has taken actions to significantly reduce the broadband communications business operating costs 
an essential element of the company s long term strategy is the growth associated with its core defense systems segment 
as part of this strategy  titan acquired eldyne  unidyne  and diversified control systems the acquired companies in may the acquired companies provide the department of defense and other government customers with systems research  development and prototyping  and integration and life cycle support of electronic  information and control systems 
the services and systems provided by the acquired companies are complementary to those provided by the existing defense systems businesses 
during  achievements in this segment included the exercise of an additional million production option and additional orders aggregating million for mini dama satellite communications terminals  and a million contract with nato to provide hardware and software products  as well as systems integration 
subsequent to year end  the company received a million task order contract to provide communications systems integration support for the us government 
in addition  titan received new awards from the us navy  with an initial value of million in and a total potential value of million over the next five years for electronic systems  support and equipment for submarine undersea warfare 
operating results the table below sets forth titan s consolidated revenues  operating profit loss  net interest expense  income tax provision benefit and net income loss for each of the three years ended december  revenues    operating profit loss    interest expense  net   income tax provision benefit    net income loss    titan s consolidated revenues were   and  in  and  respectively 
the revenue growth in was attributable to the defense systems segment  primarily reflecting the revenues generated by eldyne  unidyne and dcs from the date of acquisition  offset by revenue declines in the communications systems  software systems and emerging technologies segments 
excluding revenues from titan s applications group  which was sold in april  titan s pro forma revenues were  increased revenues in over pro forma were generated in all segments 
titan s consolidated operating profit loss has been significantly impacted by a number of factors in each of the three years shown above 
combined selling  marketing  and research and development expenses were   and  in  and  respectively  reflecting titan s efforts to expand commercial applications of its technologies and to continue developing certain defense communication technologies 
general and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant over the year period  with savings from cost cutting actions offset by increased investment in the company s emerging commercial businesses  primarily the communications systems segment 
restructuring charges were recorded in both and reflecting management s efforts to adapt to both internal and external forces impacting titan s long term operating strategy 
the charge was offset by a  pre tax gain resulting from the sale of titan s applications group 
net interest expense has fluctuated significantly over the three year period ended december  generally  the principal component of interest expense is the company s borrowings under its bank lines of credit 
in addition  the interest expense includes the interest related to the convertible subordinated debentures issued by the company in november borrowings from the company s bank lines of credit averaged   and  at weighted average interest rates of  and during  and  respectively 
also affecting interest expense is interest on the company s deferred compensation and retiree medical obligations 
interest expense related to these items was  and for  and  respectively 
interest on the deferred compensation obligation will continue to increase as the total obligation increases  while interest on the retiree medical obligation is expected to decrease 
income taxes reflect effective rates of  and in  and  respectively 
the difference between the actual provision and the effective provision based on the united states statutory tax rate in was due to the alternative minimum tax and to permanent differences between financial statement income and taxable income 
business segments communications systems the communications systems segment contains two business units  both targeting rapidly growing commercial markets 
the first business unit is satellite communications  which develops and sells satellite earth station networks and related systems which address the demand for telephony services 
the second business unit  broadband communications  specializes in providing complete turnkey security for television delivery systems  with applications for delivery of television programming via wireless  satellite  coaxial cable and fiber optics 
revenues in this segment were   and  in  and  respectively 
the composition of the revenues was significantly different over the three year period 
revenues in the satellite communications business unit were approximately  in   in  and  in however  in early  titan sold its transceiver manufacturing division which was part of this business unit 
on a pro forma basis  excluding the sold division  the satellite communications revenues were approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in pro forma revenues to  in from  in was principally due to delays in shipments on the company s rural telephony contract 
the increase in pro forma revenues from to resulted primarily from obtaining and performing on a contract to develop and integrate a satellite communications network in thailand 
revenues in included approximately  of broadband communications revenues from the completion of the company s first contract in this business area and revenues from a follow on order with this same customer 
the decrease in revenues from to was due to delays in receiving the follow on order mentioned above 
the segment revenues included approximately  of broadband communications revenues from the company s first contract in this business area 
there were no broadband communications revenues in the segment s operating loss was  in compared to  in and  in the losses in and reflect the start up nature of this segment s businesses which requires significant selling  marketing and research and development activities disproportionate to the level of revenues generated 
the company has been pursuing a process to identify potential strategic investors for the broadband communications business 
to date  an appropriate strategic investor has not been identified 
the company intends to reduce its investment in this area in  and has taken certain actions to significantly reduce the broadband communications business operating costs 
the loss in includes approximately  of losses and restructuring charges associated with titan exiting its transceiver manufacturing business 
software systems the software systems segment provides custom software products and services to assist customers in moving from older mainframe systems to distributed computing systems utilizing client server  object oriented software 
revenues in this segment were  for   in  and  in one customer accounted for approximately  of this segment s revenue in and  of this segment s revenue in both and in the second half of  this segment experienced reduced demand from this customer and this trend continued in excluding the revenues from this customer  there was moderate growth in other custom software business 
segment operating loss was in  compared to operating income of  in and  in the results were due primarily to reduced sales from the previously mentioned customer  the timing of corresponding decreases in selling  general and administrative expense  and additional costs associated with a negotiated conclusion of certain programs with this customer 
the decrease was principally due to the effect of restructuring charges for severance and other reorganization costs and the impact of reduced sales volume mentioned previously 
defense systems the defense systems segment includes two business units  information and communications systems  which provide systems solutions primarily to us and allied government and defense customers 
the defense information systems business supports high priority government programs by providing information systems engineering services  development and integration of systems and specialized products  as well as systems research  development and prototyping 
the defense communications business develops and produces advanced satellite terminals and associated voice data processing modems 
these products are specifically tailored to meet defense requirements  provide highly secure communications and are produced in relatively small quantities 
revenues in this segment were   and  for  and  respectively 
however  excluding revenues attributable to the company s applications group  which was sold in  pro forma segment revenues were  in revenues increased in principally due to  revenues generated from the acquired companies eldyne  unidyne and dcs 
revenue growth from the mini dama production contract also contributed to the revenue increase in this segment 
revenues in  and included approximately   and  respectively  for work subcontracted to the buyer of the applications group 
there was no operating profit associated with these revenues 
this contract was substantially completed in revenues and operating profit for included approximately  recovered from a termination for convenience claim with the us government for work performed in prior years 
segment operating income in was  compared with  in  and  in the operating income increase in is attributable to the revenue growth discussed previously  and certain non recurring credits resulting from the reevaluation of estimates of certain allowable contract costs based upon favorable developments with certain government audit agencies  as well as changes in the carrying value of assets being disposed of 
operating results for include  of profit resulting from a favorable settlement and from improved contract performance on the company s mini dama fixed price development contract 
this profit was offset by a charge of approximately  for restructuring costs related to the electronics division 
emerging technologies emerging technologies contains a group of mature businesses generally involved in department of defense dod funded research and development contracts and various early stage commercial businesses  involved in medical product sterilization services and systems and environmental consulting services 
the company s strategy is to use the research and development activities as a source for developing additional dod and commercial products  systems and services 
revenues in this segment were   and  in  and  respectively 
approximately  of and  of revenue was generated by the segment s early stage businesses 
substantially all remaining revenue for all periods presented was derived from the various established business lines 
the decline in revenue is primarily attributable to the sale of the company s shaped charged munitions business in september and the completion of certain pulsed power systems contracts with the french government 
this segment s operating profit loss has not been material in relation to the company s consolidated operating results 
generally losses experienced by the start up operations have offset profits contributed by the segment s other lines of business 
liquidity and capital resources during  titan used  cash for operating requirements 
in addition to funding the net loss  other significant cash uses included an increase in inventories of  principally related to commercial rural telephony products and to government satellite communications  funding requirements for certain accrued compensation obligations of  and funding of  of restructuring activities 
cash was provided primarily by collection of receivables in the defense systems segment of  the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated debentures  net of issuance costs and the repayments of borrowings under the company s revolving lines of credit  of  the refinancing of the company s denver scan facility for  and proceeds from the sale of the company s electronics division of  in november  the company issued  of convertible subordinated debentures due the net proceeds of approximately  were used to repay the borrowings under the company s revolving lines of credit 
the remaining funds were used to fund working capital requirements and other general purposes 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the company s  bank line of credit  and the company had available cash of  the company had commitments under letters of credit at december  of  which reduced availability under the line of credit to  the maturity date of the line of credit is may  subsequent to december   the company received a commitment from the bank to renew the facility through may  in connection with the company s acquisition of eldyne  unidyne and dcs in may  the company s eldyne and unidyne subsidiaries assumed and renegotiated a separate credit agreement with a lender which provides  among other things  for a working capital line of credit facility of up to  for eldyne and unidyne 
the actual borrowing base is limited for each of eldyne and unidyne to the sum of various percentages of billed and certain unbilled government and commercial receivables 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
the company had commitments under letters of credit at december  of  which  in addition to borrowing base limitations  reduced availability under the line of credit to  the company has guaranteed up to  of indebtedness under this line of credit 
the maturity date of the line of credit is may  the company intends to renegotiate this line of credit with the lender and or other banks 
cash requirements for are expected to continue to be significant 
investments in product development within the communications systems segment were substantially complete in  however  the company plans to continue aggressive sales and marketing efforts 
the company has been pursuing a process to identify potential strategic investors for the broadband communications business 
to date  an appropriate strategic investor has not been identified 
because there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining outside funding  the company will continue to reassess its investment in all its early stage businesses  in relation to the availability of funding sources  both internal and external 
as part of this assessment  the company has taken certain actions in early to reduce operating costs in the broadband communications business 
forward looking information certain cautionary statements certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition that are not related to historical results are forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements 
further  certain forward looking statements are based upon assumptions of future events which may not prove to be accurate 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those referred to below 
entry into commercial business 
prior to  the company s revenues had been derived principally from business with the department of defense and other government agencies 
since that time  the company has pursued a strategy of using the technology from its defense business to build commercial businesses 
this strategy presents certain significant risks for the company 
many of the company s commercial businesses  such as satellite communications  broadband communications  and medical sterilization  remain in an early stage 
as such  the company is subject to all the risks inherent in the operation of a start up venture  including the need to develop and maintain marketing  sales and customer support capabilities  to secure appropriate third party manufacturing arrangements  to respond to the rapid technological advances inherent in these markets  to secure the necessary financing to support these activities and  ultimately  to design and manufacture products or provide services acceptable to buyers in its target markets 
certain of the company s new products  including products for which the company has contracts for delivery  are still in the testing stage 
there can be no assurance that such tests will be completed satisfactorily or that the company will be able to satisfy all of the requirements for delivery of and payment for these products 
in addition  many of the opportunities in the satellite communications and broadband communications businesses are large  international projects which involve lengthy sales cycles 
the company s efforts to address these risks have required  and will continue to require  significant expenditures and dedicated management time and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing these risks or in developing these commercial businesses 
reliance on major software customer 
the company s software systems business is substantially dependent on business from a major telecommunications company to develop and support access carrier client server software applications 
revenues from this customer totaled approximately million  million  and million or   and of total company revenues in   and  respectively 
in the second half of  the company experienced reduced demand from this customer and this trend continued in the loss of this customer  or a substantial delay or continued decrease in the amount of its business  could have a material adverse effect on the software systems segment s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on defense spending 
the company s defense systems segment is dependent upon continued funding of us department of defense programs 
titan  like other companies doing business with the us department of defense  has been affected by declining defense budgets and has experienced increased competition in certain of its defense business areas 
the size and scope of any reductions in future defense budgets is uncertain  and management anticipates that competition in most defense related areas will continue to be intense
