construction the value of construction completed  which includes in addition to revenue  construction costs incurred by owners on construction management and similar projects  increased million to billion in  the highest level of activity since the company s revenue from construction contracts and costs of construction contracts both increased by from to billion and billion  respectively 
the value of new contracts secured in was billion  up from the billion secured in the anticipated earnings associated with these new contracts represents an increase of million from this increase in construction activity enabled the company to increase its year end backlog of work to be completed by million to billion at december  estimated earnings associated with this backlog also increased from to million  its highest level in five years 
these factors reflect the emphasis the company has placed on its marketing activities  as well as the continued growth of the company s traditional non residential construction markets 
approximately of the earnings backlog and of the value of construction backlog relates to work to be performed in and beyond 
estimated earnings from construction backlog should not be used as a basis for predicting future operating results 
earnings from construction contracts improved in over from million to million 
as a percentage of revenue  earnings from construction contracts showed a slight increase from to  but were below the level of achieved in the earnings included the recognition of million of additional losses on a contract in minneapolis  and losses on construction contracts of million incurred by the company s caribbean operations 
the caribbean operations  had losses from construction contracts of million and million in and  respectively 
as a result of this performance over the past several years  the company does not intend to actively pursue additional construction contracts in the caribbean 
in  earnings from construction contracts included the recognition of a million loss on the minneapolis project  and the write down of a million account receivable regarding a project in egypt completed in the write down was the result of a ruling against the company in february in its effort to collect this receivable 
work under construction management contracts as a percentage of value of construction completed continued to decline  from in to in construction management contracts normally involve lower risk  and therefore carry lower fees  than other types of contracts 
the trend away from less profitable construction management work has therefore contributed to the improvement in construction earnings 
the company s sureties limit the annual amount of new payment and performance bonds available to the company 
each year this limit has increased commensurate with the company s growth in revenues 
while the limitation did not restrict the company s ability to secure new work in  there could be circumstances where the limitation might influence the selection of prospective projects 
construction operating and general and administrative expenses operating expenses directly in support of construction operations increased to million in from million in the increase is due primarily to increased levels of construction activity 
the increased level of activity includes the company s emphasis on its marketing activities 
as a direct result of these marketing efforts the company secured more new contracts in than it had in any of the prior eight years 
additionally  an increase in employee benefit costs most notably medical premiums contributed to expenses being higher than in previous years 
general and administrative expenses  which include corporate overhead expenses  increased to million from million in this increase is most attributable to expenses related to management changes  and the write off of million of goodwill associated with two subsidiaries acquired in the mid s

until conditions in the real estate market improve to the point that will permit the company to readily conduct real estate transactions  the company will continue to review the asset value of the properties for impairment and make adjustments as necessary 
management believes the timing of future sales for developed properties may be accelerated as more stable market conditions begin to prevail 
for undeveloped land parcels  however  a prolonged period of time will be required to achieve reasonable values 
interest expense and other income interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due primarily to lower debt levels in interest expense associated with real estate debt declined by due primarily to debt paydowns from the sale of properties

income taxes the company had a substantial provision for income taxes in even though it had a loss before income taxes 
this was primarily attributable to state income and other taxes and the non deductibility of certain operating costs  primarily the write off of goodwill 
the company has recorded million of deferred tax assets that resulted principally from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
management believes that no valuation allowance is required for these assets because they result primarily from timing differences  which will be reversed in the future

the excess tax reserves resulted from the planned liquidation of one of the company s inactive foreign subsidiaries 
construction operating and general and administrative expenses increased from to this increase is a result of an increase in construction activity and heavier than usual legal costs

the balance of the accrued liability of  associated with the restructuring reserve set up in was absorbed by the end of  according to the program previously established

during the company sold one developed property with an adjacent land parcel and a number of condominium units  all at their approximate carrying value

exclusive of the cumulative foreign translation adjustment other income would have amounted to million 
financial condition at december   the company had cash of million  compared with million at the end of cash provided by operating activities amounted to million and is a reflection of the continuous improvement in cash management procedures at the domestic construction level 
a significant portion of this cash will be disbursed in the first quarter of to fund outstanding trade accounts payable 
the cash generated from operations was sufficient to satisfy all the company s cash requirements during the year 
the increase in construction activity  and the continued shift away from construction management contracts were also factors contributing to the improved cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by investing activities amounted to million and was due primarily to the sale of two developed real estate properties  two land parcels and the sale of marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities amounted to million and is primarily attributable to the excess of debt paydowns over borrowings 
funds provided by the sale of real estate properties were used to pay down associated debt 
in addition  the company paid down the outstanding balances on certain loans and lines of credit used for general operating purposes 
management believes the company s current cash position  in addition to cash flows from construction activities  its million revolving credit facility and amounts available from overnight credit facilities  will be sufficient to support the company s short term and foreseeable long term activities 
debt maturing in will be paid from funds generated from operations or will be refinanced before its actual maturity date 
inflation inflation and changing prices during the current fiscal year did not significantly affect the major markets in which the company conducts its business 
in view of the moderate rate of inflation  its impact on the company s business has not been significant 
earnings per share the financial accounting standards board has issued a new pronouncement which would establish new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share as well as new standards for disclosing information about an entity s capital structure 
this statement will eliminate the presentation of primary earnings per share and would require presentation of basic earnings per share  in addition to diluted earnings per share 
the principal difference between primary and basic earnings per share is that common stock equivalents are not considered in the computation of basic earnings per share 
this statement is effective for years ending after december  the company will conform with the new standard in which will require the restatement of prior years earnings per share 
management believes that the impact upon adoption will not be material to the financial statements
