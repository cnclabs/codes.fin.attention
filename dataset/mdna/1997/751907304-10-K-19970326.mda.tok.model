item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater details of the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information under item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere herein 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under the reform act which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to i the timely completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s new edram and fram products  ii broader customer acceptance of its edram products and low density fram products  iii acceptance of new high density fram products  which may be developed  iv the company s and its alliance partners ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis in the company s own facility and through its alliance foundry operations  v the company s ability to perform under existing alliance agreements and to develop new alliance relationships  vi the availability and related cost of future financing  vii the retention of key personnel  viii the outcome of the company s patent interference proceedings  and ix factors not directly related to the company  such as competitive pressures on pricing  marketing conditions in general  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general 
for additional information concerning these and other factors  see expected future results of operations in this item since its inception  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of ferroelectric technology and the design  development and commercialization of fram products and of edram products 
the company has generated revenue under license and development agreements entered into with a limited number of established semiconductor manufacturers and involving the development of specific applications of the company s technologies 
revenue has also been derived from the sale of the company s fram and edram products beginning primarily in  and  prior to  from royalties resulting from the sale by a licensee of products incorporating the company s conventional dram technology 
accordingly  fluctuations in the company s revenues have resulted primarily from the timing of the signing of license and development agreements and the achievement of related performance milestones  and  to a lesser extent  upon the timing of significant product orders and royalty payments 
the company generated minimal revenue from fram and edram product sales prior to for  and  fram product sales represented approximately  and of total product sales revenue  respectively  while edram product sales accounted for  and  respectively  for the same periods 
during such periods  product sales revenue accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenues  the remainder of which were generated principally from license and development fees and royalties earned on conventional dram product sales by nippon steel 
as a result of the company s limited revenues as compared to its substantial ongoing product research and development costs and high manufacturing costs  the company has incurred losses in each fiscal year since its inception and  prior to  required substantial capital infusions from its principal stockholders in the form of debt and equity financing 
the company has entered into development and licensing arrangements with several major semiconductor manufacturers  namely hitachi  rohm  toshiba  fujitsu  nippon steel and ibm  to advance the development of both its fram products and edram products and to provide the company with access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and capacity for such products 
in addition to these licensing arrangements  in december  the company entered into a license agreement with samsung  although such arrangement does not include any development activities between the company and samsung or the availability of manufacturing capacity to the company from samsung 
results of operations revenues 
in  product sales revenues increased by approximately over product sales revenues in to a total of million  consisting of sales of million of fram products and million of edram products  compared to total product sales revenues during of million from the sale of million of fram products and million of edram products 
the increase in product sales revenue in as compared with resulted primarily from an increase in the availability of the company s edram products from its manufacturing source during the increase in edram product availability enabled the company to fulfill during the first two quarters of a substantial customer backlog that existed at the end of increases in the volume of edram products shipped during to new and existing customers was tempered by a decrease in product average selling prices during the year 
increases in fram product revenue during resulted from the increased availability of fram products and increases in volumes of fram products sold associated with the company s kilobit fram products and rf id fram products 
the reduction in product sales revenue in as compared with the same period in resulted primarily from a shortage of edram product caused by a cessation in edram production from nippon steel  the company s only edram manufacturing source at that time 
the company ceased production of its edram products in april in response to excess inventory levels 
this earlier cessation of production together with increased customer demand and the reluctance of nippon steel to manufacture products for the company due to the company s weak financial position at that time  resulted in shortages of product availability in and a shortfall in expected sales revenues 
product revenues in were million consisting of sales of million of fram products and million of edram products 
fram product revenues in were primarily attributable to fram product sales to a major video game manufacturer 
the transition in video games from game cartridges to compact discs from to reduced the demand for such game cartridges and subsequently led to the decrease in fram revenue from to in  and  the company recognized license and development fee revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
the company s license fee revenues during resulted from the achievement of milestones pursuant to existing license arrangements  the granting of a new license for the use of the company s ferroelectric technology and the granting of fram product designs to an existing licensee 
revenues from licensing activities during were recognized from hitachi  rohm  toshiba  fujitsu and samsung 
the company s license fee revenue for resulted from the grant of licenses in the company s ferroelectric technology to toshiba  fujitsu  hitachi and rohm  and to racom and intag for use in certain rf id applications 
in  license fee revenue resulted from the company s grant of licenses to the company s ferroelectric technology to hitachi and rohm 
in the company recorded no royalty revenues 
in and  the company recorded royalty revenues of million and million  respectively  from nippon steel s sales of conventional dram products designed and developed by the company 
the royalty revenue recognized during  represents the payment of all royalties payable by nippon steel on sales of conventional megabit and megabit dram products subsequent to that payment was made in connection with the may sale to nippon steel of the company s equity interest in united memories  inc umi  the joint venture company formed by ramtron and nippon steel to design and develop advanced semiconductor memory products 
under the terms of the umi sale agreement  the company will not receive additional royalty revenue from nippon steel for periods subsequent to in  customer sponsored research and development revenues totaled 
million and were primarily attributable to design and development agreements with a number of companies  of which the company recorded not more than  of revenue from any one company 
in  customer sponsored research and development revenues totaled 
million primarily attributable to joint research and development agreements with racom  intag and hitachi  as compared to 
million for the same period in  which was primarily attributable to joint research and development agreements with racom  intag and matsushita 
cost of product sales 
in  and  cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues were  and  respectively 
the improvement in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues in over the same period in relates directly to the company s edram products 
increased sales volume  favorable average selling prices and lower supply costs for the company s edram products were the primary reasons leading to the improved cost of product sales percentage for cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for edram products is expected to continue to improve during as the company s production costs decrease 
the expected improvement in the cost of edram product sales is directly related to the company s ability to maintain reasonable average selling prices at levels comparable or slightly under the average selling price levels which existed at the end of  although there can be no assurance the company will be able to maintain such average selling prices during the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s fram products was approximately for each of  and the overall cost of product sales has remained high due primarily to the company s introduction of new fram and edram product designs  low volume of manufacturing and changes in the manufacturing processes 
furthermore  the low manufacturing volume of fram products has resulted in higher costs associated with the company s cmos underlayer supply and external packaging and testing services 
slight improvements in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for fram products are expected during as manufacturing efficiencies are achieved at the company s facility and through the use of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and facilities of the company s foundry alliances  assuming successful completion of development and product qualification 
the expected improvement in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s edram products is expected to occur as a result of an overall cost improvement from the company s foundries as their prices to the company are adjusted downward in relation to standard dram pricing 
research and development 
in  research and development expenses increased by million as compared with the same period in  due primarily to the expensing of a non recurring  non cash employee incentive program approved by the company s stockholders in december and terminated in december such research and development incentive expense totaled approximately million in  the absence of which would have resulted in a decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to the same period in of approximately 
million 
approximately 
million of such incentive expense was recorded in the decrease in research and development costs is primarily related to a decrease in manufacturing volumes associated with the company s research and development activities 
research and development expenses are expected to increase during  absent the incentive expense referred to above  as the company develops new products and processes and supports its existing and expected new alliance partners in continued fram and edram product development 
in  research and development expenses decreased by million as compared with the same period in  primarily due to decreases in costs associated with the purchase of semiconductor wafers used for production of fram products and decreased manufacturing volumes associated with research and development activities 
customer sponsored research and development expenses 
in  customer sponsored research and development expenses were primarily related to design development services with eleven different customers  of which expenses decreased by  as compared with the same period in customer sponsored research and development expenses for  related primarily to the joint research and development efforts with racom  intag and hitachi  which expenses decreased 
million as compared to sales  general and administrative 
in  sales  general and administrative expenses increased by 
million as compared with the same period in  due primarily to the expensing of a non recurring  non cash employee incentive program approved by the company s stockholders in december and terminated in december such sales  general and administrative incentive expense totaled approximately million in  the absence of which would have resulted in a decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses in as compared to the same period in of approximately 
million 
approximately 
million of such incentive expense was recorded in such decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses in as compared to the same period in relates primarily to a decrease in withholding taxes associated with the company s licensing and royalty arrangements 
increases in product sales commissions paid to distributors and reps during associated with increased product sales revenues partially offset such decreases in sales  general and administrative expenses mentioned above 
in  sales  general and administrative expenses remained flat as compared with interest expense 
in and  interest expense  related parties decreased by million and 
million  respectively  as compared with and  respectively 
such decreases were primarily due to the conversion of debt to equity of approximately million of related party notes payable and associated accrued interest  pursuant to a debt conversion agreement 
gain on disposition of equity investments 
in  the company recorded a gain of 
million on the disposition of its equity investment in umi 
in may  the company entered into an agreement with nippon steel whereby the company sold to nippon steel for million all of ramtron s voting and nonvoting common stock in umi 
expected future results of operations the company is continuing its efforts to improve and increase commercial production and sales of its edram products and low density fram products  decrease the cost of producing such products and develop and commercialize new high and low density fram products and enhancements to its existing fram and edram products 
the company expects revenues will continue to be sporadic in the foreseeable future until the company s products gain wider market acceptance  new license arrangements are entered into and milestones under the company s existing and any new license and development agreements are achieved 
the company s ability to significantly increase product sales and achieve profitability will depend on several factors  including i the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s high density fram products  ii the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s edram products with densities both greater than and less than its existing megabit density  iii wider customer acceptance of its edram products and low density fram products  iv market acceptance of new high and low density fram products which may be developed  v the company s ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis in its own facility and through alliance foundry operations  vi the availability and related cost of future financing  and vii factors not directly related to the company  including market conditions  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general 
to gain access to advanced cmos manufacturing processes and facilities  ramtron has entered into manufacturing alliances and licensing agreements for fram products with companies having or constructing advanced memory products manufacturing capability  including rohm  hitachi  toshiba and fujitsu 
since the purchase or construction of an advanced manufacturing facility capable of mass producing memory devices would require a capital outlay well beyond the company s current capital resources  the company believes that the most suitable alternative is this strategic alliance approach which the company believes will enable it to develop  manufacture and sell fram products more rapidly and cost effectively than any other available alternative 
ramtron s intention is to utilize current and future alliance relationships as foundry sources for fram products in order to provide the company with low cost  high volume  high quality fram products for resale to customers 
the company is also exploring opportunities with potential licensing partners to have such partners update the company s existing fabrication facility in colorado springs  colorado by providing state of the art manufacturing equipment in lieu of license payments and then sharing manufacturing output of such facility 
the company signed a memorandum of understanding mou with sgs thomson incorporating terms similar to these  but no definitive agreement concerning such facility upgrade exists at this time and there can be no assurance that a final agreement incorporating such terms will be entered into 
see pursue strategic development and manufacturing alliances above 
the company intends to produce edrams through strategic alliances with major semiconductor companies and to expand the market for edrams by making edram products available from multiple sources 
this approach avoids the high capital costs associated with dram manufacturing that would have otherwise been incurred by the company if it had chosen to manufacture these products with company provided resources 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has relied on its stockholders  and particularly  since  on oren l 
benton and the national electrical benefit fund  to provide working capital for its operations 
throughout   and  in the case of the fund  through the first four months of  mr 
benton and the fund financed the company s operations through a series of equity investments and loans  most of such loans were subsequently converted into equity 
in february  mr 
benton filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of mr 
benton s personal bankruptcy  the company could no longer continue to rely on mr 
benton as a source of financing  nor on the fund under terms that would have been available had mr 
benton and the fund continued to fund the company together 
in september  the company successfully completed a debt conversion plan which provided for the conversion of a significant portion of its outstanding debt into equity  and in connection therewith  the company received a new million credit facility from the fund 
the company has been successful in financing its working capital requirements from its operations since may and has not required any additional financing from the fund or any other outside resource since that time 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared with million provided by operations in the million increase in net cash used in operations in when compared with resulted primarily from a significant increase in accounts receivable and inventories during the last half of accounts receivable increased in by million over primarily as a result of a new license agreement signed in late december the first payment pursuant to the terms of that license agreement in the amount of million was received in early january inventories increased as of the end of by million resulting from production decisions made during the third quarter of pertaining to the company s edram products 
manufacturing starts have since been slowed to bring edram inventories to an optimum level to maximize the company s inventory turns and cash flows from product sales and yet provide product to the company s customers in a timely manner 
a major source of cash provided by operating activities during resulted from the company applying edram production security deposits of million held by nippon steel at the end of  to purchase edram products during as of december   nippon steel no longer required a deposit to secure production of such edram products and the amount left on deposit with nippon steel at the end of was negligible 
net cash provided by operating activities in of million increased by million from net cash used in operating activities in of million 
the million increase in cash provided by operations in when compared to resulted primarily from a million improvement in the company s net loss for the year and from the prepayment of license fees from certain license partners which was recorded as deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was 
million in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in the million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in when compared with resulted primarily from a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of assets 
in  the company entered into an agreement with nippon steel under which the company sold its interest in umi  a jointly owned dram design resource  to nippon steel for million 
no such transaction occurred in the purchase of capital equipment and facility modifications increased by 
million in when compared with and was primarily related to the addition of new test equipment  the improvement of existing manufacturing equipment and the purchase of computer related equipment used primarily in research and development activities 
net cash provided by investing activities of million in  increased by million from net cash used in investing activities in of 
million 
the million increase in cash provided by investing activities in when compared to resulted primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of a jointly owned dram design resource of million as well as a reduction in the purchase of capital equipment by million 
net cash provided by financing activities was 
million in compared with million in the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in when compared with resulted primarily from the company s ability to cash flow its operations with internally generated cash flows and therefore requiring no additional outside funding 
in  the company received approximately million in outside funding pursuant to a million line of credit with the fund  one of the company s principal shareholders 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in  increased by million from net cash provided by financing activities in of million 
the million increase in cash provided by financing activities in when compared to resulted primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of the company s stock associated with the exercise of employee stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in  decreased by million from net cash provided by financing activities in of million 
during  the company received approximately million in cash relating to milestone achievements  license expansion agreements and product design programs with existing fram technology license partners 
milestone payments pursuant to these agreements are expected to create additional cash flows during and subject to the fulfillment of certain milestone conditions 
the company also recorded an increase in product sales of approximately million in creating an additional source of cash flow for the company 
an increase in product sales activity and new license arrangements are anticipated in no additional draws on the company s million credit facility with the fund were made during leaving an available balance of million as of december  during  the company intends to finance its operations by relying on its existing cash resources at december  of approximately million  expected cash receipts from new license agreements  cash receipts from the sale of the company s products  and license and milestone payments to the company on existing license agreements of approximately million 
the company received million of such license and milestone payments in january the remaining million of license payments are payable in part upon i the first sale of product by a certain licensee or in december  whichever occurs first  and ii the completion of two preliminary designs for a certain licensee 
if certain of these development milestones are not met during  the resulting loss of license revenues to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
if required  the company also has amounts available to it under its credit facility with the fund of approximately million as of december  such credit facility agreement does not contain any special requirements for the company to satisfy any performance criteria or specific financial covenants other than those typically found in standard commercial credit agreements in order for the company to borrow amounts pursuant to the credit facility 
the company anticipates that during  the level of the company s operating expenses will increase to support anticipated sales growth and to further the research and development efforts associated with internal product development and to support existing and potential new licensing partners 
the company anticipates an increase in capital equipment expenditures during to fulfill certain manufacturing requirements for both fram and edram products 
the company will pursue leasing arrangements to finance such capital equipment purchases  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to arrange such financing  or if financing is available  if it will be on terms acceptable to the company 
based on the company s capital resources as of december  and amounts available to the company under its credit facility with the fund and based on expected near term revenues and operating costs  the company expects to be able to fund its operations through at least the company s future capital requirements include financing the growth of working capital items such as accounts receivable and inventory and the purchase of equipment 
the company is continuing to pursue additional license and development arrangements with third parties and will continue to seek reasonable sources of capital to satisfy its future operating and working capital requirements  but it has not yet identified any specific new sources of capital
