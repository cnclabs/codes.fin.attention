average balances are also provided for non earning assets  non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity 
net interest income also depends on the rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities 
the net interest margin represents net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
the net interest margin increased to in from in  and in the most significant reason for the ongoing improvement in net interest margin was the shift in asset mix toward loans

the following table presents information regarding the company s interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated 
the table presents the change in interest income or interest expense which is attributable to the change in the average balance volume and the change in interest income or interest expense which is related to change in rates 
changes in balances were responsible for an increase in net interest income of  during as asset balances shifted from the securities portfolio to the loan portfolio and changes in rates resulted in an increase of  in net interest income as declines in pricing on deposits more than offset lower rates on loans and investments

trust fees increased both in and   and   respectively 
the increase in revenue from the trust and investment management group is reflective of the continuing sales effort and the increased focus on growth 
management believes that the trust investment management group possesses a competitive advantage by offering customers local service and management of customers funds 
service charges on deposit accounts and other retail related fees increased  to  during compared to an increase of  during fee income increased for a variety of services 
fees charged to customers for overdrawn accounts were up in  as were fees charged to business customers who did not maintain significant balances but utilized a variety of cash management related services 
peoples bank trust company provides free access to automated teller machines to customers who maintain checking accounts with the bank  but implemented a fee for non customers who use peoples bank automated teller machines 
this new fee produced  in revenue during mortgage banking revenues included net gains and losses realized when mortgage loans were sold into the secondary market  service fee revenue earned from servicing those loans after they are sold and  in  a gain on the sale of loan servicing rights 
mortgage banking revenue  as reflected in the company s financial statements  has not been reduced by the associated costs  such as compensation expense  which is shown elsewhere within non interest expense 
mortgage banking revenue was  in   in  and  in this reflects a decrease in of  and an increase in of

the company does not engage in the purchase and sale of securities with the intent to generate gains

this reflects a decrease of  in compared to an increase of  in the decrease in non interest expense  which was accomplished while net interest income was growing  was an important contributor to the increase in net income for more than half of total non interest expense is comprised of salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and employee benefit expense decreased  in compared to an increase of  in during the third quarter of  peoples developed new procedures and reorganized certain operations with a goal of improving process efficiency and lowering overall non interest expense 
the improvements were based on recommendations from staff members throughout the organization  and were a major driver of lower non interest expense 
advertising expense decreased  in following a decrease of  in during  the company conducted an image campaign to increase local awareness and to support its sales efforts 
since that time  advertising had been targeted to selected audiences and growth has continued at strong rates 
fdic insurance expense was  during  down from  during and  during this decline occurred due to a significant reduction in the assessment rate during and however  that rate will be increased in and fdic insurance expense will increase  though it is anticipated to be less than s level 
income taxes the company s income tax expense was affected primarily by the level of pre tax income 
as income increased  tax expense did as well 
tax expense for increased  in following an increase of  during the company can and does purchase tax free securities and originates tax free loans as a means of generating tax free income  effectively mitigating tax expense

net deferred tax assets at december  and  were  and  deferred tax assets result  primarily  from book bad debt deductions in excess of those deductible for tax purposes 
the asset will be realized as loans are charged off in future periods 
based on the company s historical levels of taxable income and the relatively small size of the deferred tax assets recorded  management does not believe a valuation allowance for those assets was needed at december  asset and liability management the company engages in a formal process of measuring and defining the amount of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the effect on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
the goal of the asset and liability management process is to maintain a high  yet stable  net interest margin by identifying the degree of interest rate risk and developing tactics and strategies to mitigate the extent to which net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
the following tables illustrate the repricing opportunities  or rate sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a repricing may occur if the rate on the asset or liability changes as interest rates change  or  when the rate is fixed  at the time they mature 
the gap is the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities within a specific time frame 
gap is considered an indicator of the effect a change in interest rates may have on net interest income 
as of december   the company s rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive assets through one year 
this would indicate that when rates increase  net interest income may decline 
in order to accurately determine the effect of changes in interest rates  the repricing effect of each type of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability must be measured 
assets and liabilities have different characteristics and the magnitude of change differs for each 
management continually monitors the changes to net interest income which may result from changing interest rates 
at december  repriceable or maturing within months to to to to after months months year years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans       available for sale securities       total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities transaction accounts   time deposits      short term borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities      assets liability gap       cumulative asset liability gap      cumulative gap to total assets 
a significant assumption that creates the large negative gap in the to month category is that all interest bearing demand and savings accounts are subject to immediate repricing 
while it is true that contractually  those accounts are subject to immediate repricing  the rates paid on those accounts are not generally tied to specific indices and are influenced by market conditions and other factors 
accordingly  a general movement in interest rates  either up or down  may not have any immediate effect on the rates paid on these deposit accounts 
the foregoing table illustrates only one source of information about sensitivity to interest rate movements 
the core of the company s asset and liability management process consists of simulations that take into account the time that various assets and liabilities may reprice and the degree to which various categories of such assets and liabilities will respond to general interest rate movements 
interest rate risk can only be represented by a measurement of the effects of changing interest rates given the capacity for and magnitude of change on specific assets and liabilities 
liquidity liquidity refers to the availability of funds to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan commitments and pay expenses 
the company s loan portfolio  excluding loans held for sale  increased to  at december  from  at december   an increase of  or 
increases in deposits provided funding for loan growth in total deposits at december  were  an increase of  from balances of  at december  a common measure of liquidity is the loan to deposit ratio 
as of december  the loan to deposit ratio was in  and in increasing this ratio was an important goal for the company s management during  and significantly added to the company s profitability by shifting assets from lower yield securities to higher yield loans 
loan commitments include unfunded portions of lines of credit and commercial letters of credit 
these unfunded commitments may or may not require funding 
at december  and  such commitments totaled  and  respectively 
loan commitments generate fee income for the company 
loan quality the company has maintained a high level of quality in the loan portfolio 
non performing loans are those loans which are past due more than days and still accruing interest and those loans on which the company no longer accrues interest 
as of december  and  non performing loans totaled  and  respectively 
as a percent of total loans  including loans held for sale  non performing loans were 
at december  and 
at december  the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to provide for potential future loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  in   in  and  in the increase in the provision for loan losses in had a negative impact on profitability  but was considered necessary by management to maintain the allowance at a desirable level and provide for the substantial loan growth during the year 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated at least quarterly by management based upon a review of identified loans with more than a normal degree of risk  historical loss percentages  and present and forecast economic conditions affecting borrowers 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was  for  and  for as a percent of total loans  including loans held for sale  the allowance for loan losses was at december  and at december  management s analysis indicates that the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate to cover potential losses on identified loans with credit problems and on the remaining portfolio based on historical percentages 
gross loan charge offs in  and  were   and  respectively 
as a percentage of average loans  gross loan charge offs were   and 
for those periods 
effective january   the company was required to adopt financial accounting standard no 
fas which required recognition of loan impairment 
loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated 
impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a portion of the allowance for loan losses is allocated to impaired loans 
the effect of adopting this standard is included in the provision for loan losses and was not material 
the company s average investment in impaired loans during and was  and  respectively 
at december    of loans were deemed to be impaired and  of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to those loans 
the loans that are classified as impaired and are still accruing interest are generally collateralized and currently making payments 
however  based on past experience with the customer and their analysis of the situation  management believes that it is not probable that these loans will be repaid in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
as a result  management has classified these loan relationships as impaired 
capital position both the company and peoples are required to comply with capital requirements promulgated by their primary regulators 
those regulations require the maintenance of specified levels of capital to total assets the leverage ratio and to risk weighted assets the risk based capital ratio

 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in it revises the accounting for transfers of financial assets  such as loans and securities  and for distinguishing between sales and secured borrowings 
it is effective for some transactions in and others in management does not expect adoption of this standard to have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
