item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources somanetics corporation is a development stage company formed to develop  manufacture and market processor based medical diagnostic and patient monitoring equipment using invos technology 
since inception january   the company has incurred an accumulated deficit of  through november  net cash used in operations during fiscal was approximately  cash was used primarily to i fund the company s net loss  consisting primarily of selling  general and administrative expenses and research  development and engineering expenses approximately  net of depreciation and amortization expense  and ii decrease accrued liabilities primarily due to a the reversal of the reserves to replace unpaid domestic cerebral oximeters and somasensors and upgrade the cerebral oximeters received  b use of the reserves to replace international cerebral oximeters  and c payment of expenses and settlement costs associated with the class action lawsuits approximately 
these uses of cash were partially offset by i a decrease in accounts receivable approximately  primarily due to lower sales in fiscal and higher bad debt expenses  ii a decrease in other assets approximately  primarily due to the elimination of deferred offering costs  and iii an increase in accounts payable approximately  primarily due to increased expenses and inventory purchases in preparation for selling and marketing efforts in the united states combined with slower payment 
management expects working capital requirements to increase if sales increase 
before the company received fda clearance to market the cerebral oximeter in the united states  several domestic distributors of the invos cerebral oximeter expressed their desire to terminate their distributor agreements with the company 
the company did not believe that its distributor agreements required it to accept returns of products sold to distributors in connection with a termination of the distribution agreement 
the company  however  reserved for the uncollectibility of accounts receivable from such distributors 
the company terminated of its domestic distributors in fiscal  and currently has united states distributors for its products and additional employees selling its products directly in the remaining territories 
the company entered into new distribution agreements with its four remaining and two new united states distributors on different terms and conditions  including different prices 
it also hired direct sales personnel in fiscal because of the significant change in the composition of the company s us distributors  the change in the product being marketed by the us distributors the invos a  rather than the invos  and the changed terms and conditions applicable to the new and continuing distributors  the company wrote off substantially all of its receivables from domestic distributors including  from somatek  inc plus the previously reserved amounts in exchange for the return of their  and their customers  old invos cerebral oximeters and somasensors which returns resulted in a  recovery of bad debts in fiscal 
because the company has more invos cerebral oximeters than it expects to sell in the next year  the company recorded a reserve for the value of the devices in excess of one year s supply in fiscal approximately 
the company intends to upgrade the returned invos cerebral oximeters and sell them in countries that do not require compliance with the standards met by the invos a cerebral oximeter 
in addition  the company intends to sell rather than exchange invos a cerebral oximeters to united states distributors and customers who had not paid for the invos cerebral oximeters they returned to the company 
therefore  in fiscal  the company reversed its  reserve for the extra cost of exchanging new invos a cerebral oximeters with such persons for their old devices and for the costs of upgrading the old devices for resale 
continuing distributors and customers who paid for their invos cerebral oximeters were permitted to exchange their old devices for a new one 
as a result  each distributor and customer only paid once and received a new model cerebral oximeter 
the company also reversed its  reserve for the cost of replacing somasensors recalled in the net effect of the foregoing on the company s results of operations was an increase of approximately  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
additional distributors might terminate their agreements with the company or be terminated by the company 
distributor terminations may increase the company s costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to replace distributors desiring to terminate their distribution agreements  engage distributors in additional territories  or retain its existing distributors 
the company s inability to engage  replace or retain distributors could have a material adverse effect on its ability to market and sell its product 
the company s principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds of equity and debt investments from sales of the company s common shares and notes 
see statements of shareholders equity deficiency of the company s financial statements included in item of this report 
these funds were used primarily to fund the company s losses in connection with the development of the invos technology  the invos  the invos cerebral oximeter and the related disposable somasensor 
the company believes that its accumulated deficit will continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
effective february   the company redeemed all of its outstanding convertible preferred shares for per share at a total redemption cost to the company of approximately  and instead of the convertible preferred shares formerly issuable upon the exercise of certain options  the company will pay to the person exercising such options for each convertible share otherwise receivable 
also  on march   all  outstanding unit purchase options expired 
on april   the company completed the placement of  units  at a price of per unit  for gross proceeds of  through an offering complying with regulation s under the securities act of  as amended 
the net proceeds to the company  after deducting the placement agents fee and the expenses of the offering  were approximately  each unit consists of two newly issued common shares  par value per share  and one warrant to purchase one common share 
the warrants are immediately exercisable and transferable separately from the common shares 
each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at an initial exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment  at any time through april   unless earlier redeemed 
the warrants are redeemable for by the company at any time if certain conditions are met  these conditions have not been met as of january  the company also granted the placement agent warrants to purchase  common shares at per share exercisable during the four year period beginning april  during fiscal   warrants issued in the company s regulation s offering and exercisable at a share  and  warrants issued in the company s april regulation s offering and exercisable at a share  were exercised  and the company paid the placement agent in such offerings a  fee in connection with those exercises 
also during fiscal  the company received approximately  from the exercise of employee stock options 
also during fiscal  two shareholders of the company filed two purported class action lawsuits against the company alleging various securities law violations  one which was settled in fiscal for a description of a suit filed by a shareholder of the company on march  in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated  against the company  four of its present and former directors and four other officers  former officers or employees of the company in an action captioned jacobson  et al v 
somanetics corporation  et al  and the settlement of that lawsuit  see note of notes to financial statements included in item of this report 
on september   the remaining  outstanding class m warrants were exercised for a common share  and on november   the remaining  outstanding non redeemable class b warrants expired 
on november   gary d 
lewis paid the company  the outstanding principal amount of the loan at the time in full satisfaction of all of his obligations under the loan made by the company to him on february   and the company discharged the second mortgage and released the security interests securing the loan and wrote off approximately  of accrued interest with respect to that loan 
effective november   the company redeemed all of its outstanding redeemable class b warrants for per warrant at a total redemption cost to the company of approximately  also  on november   the company completed the placement of  newly issued common shares  par value per share  at a price of per share through an offering complying with regulation s under the securities act of  as amended 
the net proceeds to the company  after deducting the placement agents fee  the expenses of the offering and  of other deferred offering costs  were approximately  as of november  the company had working capital of  and cash and cash equivalents of  total current liabilities of  and shareholder s equity of  the company has no loan commitments 
the company expects that its primary needs for liquidity in fiscal will be i to fund its losses and sustain its operations  including funding a marketing costs for the cerebral oximeter  b additional sales and marketing  manufacturing  service  quality control  medical affairs  management and administrative personnel expected to be hired in fiscal  c further development and testing of enhancements to  and product extensions of  the cerebral oximeter  and d additional research and development projects  and ii for working capital  including increased accounts receivable and inventories of components and sales units to satisfy expected commercial sales orders 
in addition  management has budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures during fiscal as a result of the company s ability to market and sell the cerebral oximeter in the united states  the company has increased its operating costs and workforce from employees as of november   to employees as of november  in addition  the company has budgeted to add sales and marketing  medical affairs  management  manufacturing  service  quality control  and administrative employees in fiscal  five of which have been hired as of january  and an additional two of which are expected to be hired in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of such increases  the company believes that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at november  will be sufficient to sustain the company s operations at budgeted levels and its needs for liquidity into the third quarter of fiscal by that time the company will be required to raise additional cash either through additional sales of products  through sales of securities  by incurring additional indebtedness or by some combination of the foregoing 
if the company is unable to raise additional cash by that time  it will be required to reduce or discontinue its operations 
the expected use of the company s cash and cash equivalents are based on certain estimates and assumptions made by the company 
such estimates and assumptions are subject to change as a result of actual experience and there can be no assurance that actual capital requirements necessary to market the cerebral oximeter and somasensor  to develop enhancements to  and product extensions of  the cerebral oximeter  to conduct research and development concerning additional potential applications of invos technology and related technologies and for working capital will not be substantially greater than current estimates 
on november   the company received notification that the fda had rescinded the company s previous k clearance to market the invos cerebral oximeter 
as a result  all commercial sales of the company s products were suspended and the company notified its united states distributors to stop selling the cerebral oximeter and to advise their customers to stop using the device 
in february  the company resumed marketing its products in several foreign countries  including japan  its largest market outside the united states 
on june  the company received clearance from the fda to market the cerebral oximeter in the united states 
the company s current financial condition and recent results of operations and the status of its product marketing efforts and sales have been affected by the process of obtaining such clearance 
as of january   the company had international distributors  domestic distributors  direct sales personnel and international sales consultant 
during fiscal  the company sold its products to of its international distributors and devoted most of its united states marketing to entering into distribution agreements with distributors  hiring direct sales personnel and replacing existing cerebral oximeters with the invos a cerebral oximeter 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful or profitable in marketing the cerebral oximeter and the related somasensor 
the company does not believe that product sales will be sufficient to fund the company s operations in fiscal the company has entered into a letter agreement  dated as of january   pursuant to which the company has exclusively retained a managing underwriter to underwrite a proposed public offering by the company of  newly issued common shares subject to  and after giving effect to  the proposed one for ten reverse stock split being submitted for shareholder approval at the annual meeting of shareholders 
the company has also agreed to grant the underwriter an option to purchase an additional  common shares to cover over allotments and a five year warrant to purchase an amount of shares equal to of the common shares sold in the offering at an exercise price equal to of the purchase price for the common shares in the offering 
among other things  the offering is contingent on consummation of the reverse split and the satisfactory completion of a due diligence investigation of the company by the underwriter and its agents 
any such offering will be made only by means of a prospectus 
in addition  the type and amount of security  if any  that might ultimately be issued in any such offering have not yet been definitively determined and will be dependent on negotiations with the underwriter  market conditions and management s then current estimate of the proceeds necessary or desired to sustain the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that such offering will occur or that the company will be able to raise any capital or capital in amounts it desires  or on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
also as of november   there were  redeemable warrants outstanding  exercisable at a share until july   and  redeemable warrants outstanding exercisable at a share until april  these warrants were issued in the company s and april regulation s securities offerings 
the conditions permitting the company to redeem these warrants have not been met as of january  in addition  the placement agents and their transferees hold warrants to purchase  common shares exercisable at a share   warrants exercisable at a share  and  warrants exercisable at a share 
there can be no assurance that additional warrants will be exercised and it is unlikely that they will be exercised if the exercise price exceeds the market price of the common shares 
the company has the right to reduce the exercise price of these warrants 
the company has no loan commitments 
there can be no assurance that even if the company receives additional capital  it will be able to achieve the level of sales necessary to sustain its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any funds on terms acceptable to the company and at times required by the company through sales of the company s products  sales of securities or loans in sufficient quantities

somanetics corporation and gary d 
lewis  see note of notes to financial statements included in item of this report 
the ultimate outcome of the langford litigation cannot presently be determined 
if the company must pay any significant additional amount to defend or settle the langford lawsuit or if it must pay a significant judgment in connection with this lawsuit  its financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected  and capital intended for use in the marketing of the cerebral oximeter or to develop enhancements to  or product extensions of  the cerebral oximeter or other products may have to be reallocated to satisfy any such requirements 
in addition  any such expenses will  when incurred  have the effect of increasing the company s net loss or decreasing its net income during the periods in which they are incurred 
the company s ability to use its accumulated net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income  if any  for income tax purposes  is limited due to the initial public offering ipo of its securities in march see note of notes to financial statements included in item of this report 
results of operations since the company s inception january  its primary activities have consisted of research and development of the invos technology  the invos  the invos cerebral oximeter and the related disposable somasensor 
the company is in the development stage and has accumulated losses of  during the fiscal years ended november   and  the company recognized revenues of   and  respectively 
the decrease in sales for the year ended november  was primarily attributable to a more than decrease in the average selling price of commercial cerebral oximeters to distributors and reduced shipments to europe and to baxter limited in japan 
the increase in sales for the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november   can be attributed to sales to baxter limited  the company s distributor in japan  and increased sales to distributors in south america  partially offset by lower sales to the company s former japanese distributor in the first quarter and the sale of refurbished older model cerebral oximeters at substantially lower prices than new model cerebral oximeters 
approximately  and of the company s net sales in fiscal  and  respectively  were export sales 
sales of refurbished units  commercial units and somasensors comprised approximately  and  respectively  of the company s fiscal year sales   and  respectively  of the company s fiscal year sales and  and  respectively  of the company s fiscal year sales 
two international distributors accounted for approximately and  respectively  of total revenues for fiscal year  approximately and  respectively  of total revenues for fiscal year and approximately and of total revenues for fiscal year the company terminated its japanese distributor effective january  on march   the company announced the engagement of baxter limited as its exclusive distributor in japan 
on april   the company received its license from the japanese ministry of health and welfare to market its product in japan 
as described above in liquidity and capital resources  all commercial sales were suspended in late november  upon notification from the fda that it was rescinding the company s k clearance 
the company resumed international sales in february  and the company received k clearance to market the cerebral oximeter in the united states in june for descriptions of i the company s resumption of international sales  ii changes in the company s distributors  iii the company s receipt of k clearance in  and iv the company s need to raise additional capital to sustain operations  see liquidity and capital resources 
there can be no assurance that the publication of adverse results from research regarding the cerebral oximeter  the fda s rescission of the company s k clearance for the cerebral oximeter and the company s financial condition will not adversely affect the company s reputation or its ability to market and sell its device 
the company expects cerebral oximeter sales to increase from fourth quarter levels 
the company expects to hire direct sales personnel in the first quarter of fiscal no assurance can be given that sales of the cerebral oximeter and somasensor will provide sufficient cash to fund the company s operations  and the company does not believe that product sales will provide sufficient cash to fund the company s operations in the first quarter ending february  the company expects sales of the disposable somasensor to become a larger portion of the company s revenues in the future after the company sells a significant number of cerebral oximeters to its distributors and they are resold to hospitals 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was approximately and in each of the fiscal years and was approximately 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily because of total revenues in fiscal consisted of sales of refurbished cerebral oximeters  which are sold approximately at cost  thereby reducing overall gross margin  lower average selling prices for commercial cerebral oximeters and an increase in the cost of the somasensor  partially offset by an approximately decrease in materials cost for the cerebral oximeter in fiscal excluding sales of refurbished units  gross margins were relatively unchanged from fiscal to fiscal  lower material costs for the cerebral oximeter were offset by the lower average selling prices for commercial cerebral oximeters and the increased cost of the somasensor 
comparing fiscal gross margins to fiscal gross margins  lower initial manufacturing  tooling and engineering costs in fiscal  the reduced level of personnel in fiscal and the higher level of sales over which fixed costs of sales were spread in fiscal  were offset by an increased allocation of overhead costs in fiscal  as a result of the reallocation of space and indirect labor required for manufacturing  increased costs of the somasensor in fiscal and the sale of refurbished units in fiscal approximately at cost  thereby reducing overall gross margins 
the direct and indirect costs to manufacture cerebral oximeters are expected to decline as a percentage of sales as and if i the company increases sales  production and volume purchases  and ii the company ceases to incur non recurring tooling and manufacturing charges 
any new products or enhancements developed during fiscal might increase such costs 
in addition  margins might be favorably impacted if direct sales by the company in the united states increase the company s average selling price of its products 
however  sales of refurbished devices in could have an adverse impact on gross margins 
the company incurred research  development and engineering expenses of   and  for the years ended november   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to an approximately  charge in fiscal to engineering expenses for obsolete purchased parts inventory relating to engineering design changes to the cerebral oximeter model designed to comply with tuv  partially offset by increased consulting fees in fiscal in connection with new product development since the company received k clearance for the cerebral oximeter 
the decrease in fiscal is attributable to reductions in research  development  and engineering personnel from three at november  to two at november   decreased engineering consulting services and clinical testing in fiscal incurred in in connection with preparing the cerebral oximeter model a for commercial sale and in connection with the company s k application  and discontinued development of extensions of and enhancements to the cerebral oximeter and other invos technology except for the invos a cerebral oximeter  partially offset by an approximately  charge in the second quarter to engineering expenses for obsolete purchased parts inventory relating to engineering design changes to the invos a cerebral oximeter and costs associated with the issuance of two patents relating to the company s invos technology and cerebral oximeter 
research  development and engineering activities in fiscal consisted primarily of defending the previous k applications  preparing and filing a new k application in february  developing improvements to the somasensor  completing modifications to the invos cerebral oximeter requested by the fda  beginning development of product line extensions of the cerebral oximeter for use on children and newborns in operating rooms and intensive care units and enhancements to the cerebral oximeter  and  through neurophysics  researching the feasibility and developing prototypes of four new products 
research  development and engineering expense in fiscal is attributable to i the salaries and wages of research  development and engineering personnel  engaged primarily in engineering improvements to the disposable somasensor  ii evaluating the results of the clinical trials that support the k submission  iii preparing and defending the new k application  iv working to gain the ce mark and csa and ul certifications for the cerebral oximeter  and v material costs 
research  development and engineering expense in fiscal consisted primarily of i salaries and wages of research  development and engineering personnel  engaged primarily in developing the cerebral oximeter model designed to comply with tuv  as well as improvements to the disposable somasensor  designing protocols for  and evaluating the results of  the clinical trials that support the k submission  ii consulting fees  iii material costs and iv testing fees 
the company expects research  development and engineering expense to increase for fiscal as a result of the two persons hired in fiscal after the second quarter to support new projects and the one person planned to be hired in fiscal in medical affairs and increased new product development and testing efforts 
the company and expects to incur research  development and engineering expense to develop and test product extensions of the cerebral oximeter for use on children and newborns in operating rooms and intensive care units  enhancements to the cerebral oximeter and other uses of the company s invos technology and related technologies 
the company has entered into a consulting order with neurophysics corporation pursuant to which the company is supporting neurophysics research into the feasibility and development of prototypes of four new products 
see item of this report under the caption business recent developments products and marketing 
the company expects this order to increase its research and development expenses by approximately  a month 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended november    and  totaled   and  respectively 
the increase for fiscal is primarily attributable to a  increase in selling related expenses  one time charges of  for write downs of excess refurbished and obsolete inventory  an increase in non productive  indirect labor and overhead of  a  increase in warranty expenses  and increases in shareholder relations and various fees of  partially offset by a decrease of  in salaries and wages  a  decrease in professional fees  a  decrease in occupancy costs principally due to the expiration of operating leases and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of  the  bad debt recovery resulting from the returns of invos cerebral oximeters by domestic distributors whose receivables had been written off   reversal of the reserve for the extra cost of exchanging new invos a cerebral oximeters for invos cerebral oximeters held by domestic distributors who had not yet paid for their devices  and the cost of upgrading the old devices  and  reversal of the reserve for replacing somasensors recalled in  were partially offset by a  reserve accrued for excess invos cerebral oximeters in inventory and obsolete inventory and a  reserve for doubtful accounts taken in connection with receivables from some foreign distributors 
these amounts are included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to a  reduction in legal and accounting fees  a  reduction in salaries  wages and related expenses  a  reduction in depreciation expense as a result of some assets becoming fully depreciated  a  reduction in facility expenses  and a  reduction in expenses to get sales  partially offset by the  settlement with a former distributor in japan 
salaries  wages  and related expenses  including expenses for temporary employees and outside consulting services  decreased approximately  for the year ended november  over the year ended november   primarily due to a reduction in payroll and related benefits of  partially offset by an increase in temporary and contract labor of approximately  an increase in consulting services of approximately  and a net increase in other related expenses of approximately  salaries  wages  and related expenses  including expenses for temporary employees and outside consulting services  decreased approximately  for the year ended november  over the year ended november   primarily due to a reduction in consulting expenses of  and a  reduction in payroll and related benefits 
the decrease in payroll and related benefits is the result of a reduction in workforce from employees at november   to employees at november  the company expects salaries  wages and related expenses to increase approximately million in because of additional employees and consultants 
during fiscal after may  the company hired employees and four consultants 
during fiscal  the company has budgeted to add sales and marketing  medical affairs  management  manufacturing  service  quality control  and administrative personnel 
the company expects to incur these expenses before receiving substantially increased proceeds from sales of its products  and such expenses will continue even if revenues do not increase 
therefore  in the short run  they are expected to increase the company s net losses 
selling expenses including expenses for travel  entertainment  marketing  clinical research  and industry trade show participation increased approximately  for the year ended november  over fiscal  primarily due to the increased provision of cerebral oximeters for clinical research  the costs associated with equipping direct us sales personnel with demonstration equipment  and the added cost of promotional equipment and materials in the us 
such increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel and related expenses of  due to fewer international trips and fewer employees in sales and marketing for approximately seven months of the fiscal year 
selling expenses including expenses for travel  entertainment  marketing  clinical research  and industry trade show participation decreased approximately  for the year ended november  over the same period in  primarily due to the  accrual in fiscal in connection with the plan to replace invos cerebral oximeters with cerebral oximeters designed to comply with tuv  clinical trial expenses in fiscal associated with the k filed on february   and a reduction in advertising expenses in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in trade show participation and travel expenses 
selling  travel  entertainment  marketing  clinical research  industry trade show participation and related expenses are expected to increase approximately  in fiscal in connection with i supporting the company s domestic distributor network  ii resumed marketing in the united states  iii engaging and training additional direct sales personnel  iv supporting the company s international distributor network and increased selling efforts in international markets  and v commencing and maintaining the marketing clinical studies to support the clinical utility of the cerebral oximeter in a variety of procedures 
clinical research expenses are also expected to increase if and when the company tests product extensions of the cerebral oximeter in a clinical setting 
during  the company expects to participate in several international and domestic trade shows and conventions  increase support to existing distributors  add additional international distributors and increase product awareness through advertising and promotional campaigns 
for the fiscal year ended november   as compared to the fiscal year ended in  professional fees and expenses decreased approximately  primarily as a result of a reduction in professional fees and related expenses incurred in connection with the obtaining k clearance for the cerebral oximeter and lower patent fees 
as of november   the company had accrued approximately  in legal and accounting fees 
see notes and of notes to financial statements included in this report 
for the fiscal year ended november   as compared to the fiscal year ended in  professional fees and expenses decreased approximately  primarily as a result of a reduction in professional fees and related expenses incurred in connection with the fda s rescission of the company s k and the related impact on the company s regulatory filings and lower patent fees 
as of november   the company had accrued  in legal and professional fees 
the company s monthly office expenses  including lease commitments  supplies  subscriptions  equipment rentals and related expenses decreased approximately  for the year ended november   over the year ended november   primarily due to the reduction in personnel and the expiration of operating lease commitments 
the company expects these expenses to increase as the company hires additional personnel 
for the year ended november   over the year ended november   a  reduction was due primarily to the reduction in personnel and the expiration of operating lease commitments 
interest expense for the fiscal years ended november    and totaled  and  respectively 
interest expense incurred during fiscal year was due to the bridge loan of  from rauscher pierce clark  inc  used to redeem the class b warrants on november  the bridge loan and related interest were paid out of the proceeds of the regulation s offering on november  interest incurred in fiscal and is primarily due to the secured note payable to a bank incurred during november interest income totaled   and  for the years ended november   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income for the fiscal year ended november  and over the fiscal years ended november  and  respectively  is primarily due to the use of cash in operations  partially offset by interest income from the investment of the cash received from the regulation s offerings in november  april  july and august the company expects interest income to decrease as the company uses cash in its operations 
other income increased to  in fiscal  primarily as a result of sublease income received on a portion of the company s facilities
