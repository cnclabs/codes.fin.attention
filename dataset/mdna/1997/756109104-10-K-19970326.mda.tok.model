page impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenant s sales volumes or increases in the consumer price index 
management expects that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in increases in rent over time 
however  inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on the tenants if increases in the tenant s operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 
approximately of the properties are leased to tenants under net leases in which the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses 
these features in the leases reduce the company s exposure to rising expenses due to inflation
