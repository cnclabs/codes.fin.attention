the company s expansion into new geographic markets in which its competitors are already established  and expansion of the company s competitors into markets in which the company is currently operating  have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on the company s operations 
in addition  the company believes that it will face increased competition in the future as the company and its competitors continue to expand their operations and scope of services 
any attempt by the company or any of its competitors to reduce prices systematically to gain market share or otherwise could result in industry wide reduced prices and lower gross margins 
over the last few years  the company s rapid growth has resulted largely from the company s aggressive new store opening strategy 
while the company intends to continue pursuing an aggressive new store expansion strategy by opening approximately new superstores in fiscal and by continuing to consider strategic acquisitions  there is no guarantee that the company s historic growth rate can or will continue or that such new store openings or acquisitions will occur 
the company s ability to open new superstores at its planned rate is dependent on a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
in addition  the company s expansion strategy includes clustering new stores in existing markets  which results in some transfer of sales from existing stores to the new locations 
while management believes that its aggressive expansion strategy will improve its overall market position and  ultimately  its profitability  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the company intends to continue to expand the operations of its related businesses  copymax  furnituremax and most recently quadmax electronic retailing initiatives which are still being developed and refined 
the expansion of these related businesses requires the investment of significant cash and resources  which may diminish the company s overall success and profitability

while the company intends to continue investing aggressively in futuremax  an information systems replatforming project based on improved client server systems and technology  to support the company s rapid growth  there can be no assurance that these upgraded systems and controls will enhance the company s profitability 
in addition  although the company continues to evaluate its distribution strategy and methods in order to determine how to utilize new and improved technology to increase inventory controls  reduce expenses and delivery lead times  there can be no assurance that changes in the company s current distribution methods will accomplish these goals 
the foregoing factors could affect the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results during fiscal and beyond to be materially different from any anticipated results expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
the company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents and funds available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund its planned store openings and other operating cash needs for at least the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional sources of financing prior to that time as a result of unanticipated cash needs  acquisitions or other opportunities or disappointing operating results 
there also can be no assurance that any additional funds required by the company will be available to the company on satisfactory terms
