item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is the successor to a company formed in and commenced operations on march  by acquiring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the predecessor 
the predecessor s management and the manufacturing of its high line class a motor coaches were largely unaffected by the predecessor acquisition 
however  the company s consolidated financial statements for fiscal years  and all contain predecessor acquisition related expenses  consisting primarily of the amortization of acquired goodwill 
on march   the company acquired from harley davidson certain assets of holiday rambler in exchange for million in cash   shares of redeemable preferred stock which is currently convertible into  shares of common stock  and the assumption of most of the liabilities of holiday rambler 
concurrently  the company acquired ten holiday world dealerships for million  including a million subordinated promissory note  and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the company sold seven holiday world dealerships in  retired the million note from the proceeds of these sales  and intends to sell the remaining three dealerships 
the holiday acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
beginning on march   the acquired operations were incorporated into the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  contain expenses related to the holiday acquisition  primarily consisting of a million increase in cost of sales resulting from the sale of inventory in the first and second quarters that was written up to fair value at the date of the holiday acquisition  interest expense  the amortization of debt issuance costs and holiday acquisition goodwill 
results of operations compared with net sales increased from million in to million in  primarily due to the holiday acquisition 
excluding the holiday acquisition  net sales of monaco motor coaches decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to difficulties in achieving higher production rates of motor coaches at its coburg facility  which commenced operations in late net sales in also included million of sales of units that were either previously owned or not holiday rambler units and service revenues generated by the holiday world dealerships 
the company s overall unit sales increased almost five fold from units in to  units in excluding units sold by the holiday world dealerships that were either previously owned or not holiday rambler units 
the company s overall average unit selling price declined from  in to  in  primarily as a result of the company selling a significantly large number of lower priced holiday rambler products  particularly towable products 
due to the inclusion of holiday rambler s generally lower priced products  the company expects its overall average unit selling price to remain below  gross profit increased by million from million in to million in and gross margin increased from in to in the increase in gross profit and gross margin was limited by a million increase in cost of sales as a result of an inventory write up to fair value arising from the holiday acquisition 
without this charge  gross margin would have been for gross margin in was depressed primarily due to start up inefficiencies relating to the windsor model and unexpected costs associated with making three model changes simultaneously 
one of the company s objectives continues to be to improve individual model gross margins  primarily through additional purchasing and manufacturing synergies anticipated to be derived from the holiday acquisition 
the company s overall gross margin may fluctuate in future periods if the mix of products shifts from higher to lower gross margin units or if the company encounters unexpected manufacturing difficulties or competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in was primarily attributable to the addition of the holiday rambler operations that have traditionally had higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales than monaco 
in addition  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses in were unusually low  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in part because of lower than normal incentive based compensation 
the company expects continued reduction of holiday rambler s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  however  the combined company s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is expected to remain higher than the level prior to the holiday acquisition 
amortization of goodwill was  in compared with  in at december   goodwill arising from the predecessor acquisition  net of accumulated amortization  was million  which is currently being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
goodwill of approximately million was acquired in the holiday acquisition and is being amortized over years 
operating income was million in  a million increase over the million in the increase in the company s gross margin was less than the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  resulting in a decline in operating margin from in to in the company s operating margin was adversely affected in by a million expense related to an inventory write up to fair value as a result of the holiday acquisition 
without that charge  the company s operating margin would have been for the year 
interest expense increased substantially from  in to million in the company s interest expense included approximately  of floor plan interest expense relating to the holiday world dealerships 
additionally  interest expense included  related to the amortization of million in debt issuance costs recorded in conjunction with the holiday acquisition 
these costs are being written off over a five year period 
the company capitalized approximately  of interest in primarily due to the purchase of the holiday world dealerships and construction in progress at the manufacturing facility in wakarusa  indiana 
the company capitalized  of interest in related to the expansion of its coburg  oregon facility 
the company reported a provision for income taxes of million  or an effective tax rate of  for compared to million  or an effective tax rate of  for the comparable period in net income increased by million from million in to million in due to substantial increases in net sales and operating income that more than offset increases in interest and amortization expense 
compared with net sales for increased by million from million in to million in  a increase 
the increase was attributable primarily to net sales of the company s windsor model motor coach  which was introduced in and  to a lesser extent  net sales of its dynasty model motor coach  offset by decreases in the net sales of its signature and executive model motor coaches 
total unit net sales for were up over while the company s average unit selling price decreased  with a increase for same models being offset by a shift in the mix of motor coaches sold towards the company s lower priced models  windsor and dynasty 
gross profit for decreased  or  and gross margin decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin in was attributable to several factors 
in the first half of  the company experienced start up inefficiencies related to the windsor model resulting in lower than projected gross margins 
in addition  the company encountered many unexpected costs in making three model changes simultaneously during the third quarter 
these costs  combined with a sales mix that included a lower than anticipated percentage of higher margin signature and executive motor coaches  significantly lowered the company s gross margin for the year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by  or  in  but decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to a combination of marketing and administrative efficiencies related to the company s increased sales level and a significant decline  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in incentive based compensation 
amortization of goodwill arising from the predecessor acquisition was  in  the same as in operating income for was million  a million decrease from the company s lower gross margin resulted in a decline in operating margin from in to in interest expense increased from  in to  in due to higher outstanding borrowings 
the company capitalized approximately  of interest paid in that was incurred in connection with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in coburg  oregon 
net income of million in was million lower than that reported for the decline was attributable to the substantial increase in net sales being more than offset by the reduction in gross margin  lower operating income and higher interest expense 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations for the periods presented 
factors that may affect future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including statements that include the words believes  expects or anticipates or similar expressions 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  the factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the reader should carefully consider  together with the other matters referred to herein  the factors described below 
the company cautions the reader  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company s net sales  gross margin and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to factors such as the mix of products sold  the ability to utilize and expand manufacturing resources efficiently  the introduction and consumer acceptance of new models offered by the company  competition  the addition or loss of dealers  the timing of trade shows and rallies  and factors affecting the recreational vehicle industry as a whole 
in addition  the company s overall gross margin on its products may decline in future periods to the extent the company increases its sales of lower gross margin towable products or if the mix of motor coaches shifts to lower gross margin units 
due to the relatively high selling prices of the company s products in particular  its high line class a motor coaches  a relatively small variation in the number of recreational vehicles sold in any quarter can have a significant effect on sales and operating results for that quarter 
demand in the overall recreational vehicle industry generally declines during the winter months  while sales and revenues are generally higher during the spring and summer months 
with the broader range of recreational vehicles now offered by the company as a result of the holiday acquisition  seasonal factors could have a significant impact on the company s operating results in the future 
in addition  unusually severe weather conditions in certain markets could delay the timing of shipments from one quarter to another 
cyclicality the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic  demographic and political conditions that affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
unit sales of recreational vehicles excluding conversion vehicles reached a peak of approximately  units in and declined to approximately  units in although unit sales of high line class a motor coaches have increased in each year since  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
furthermore  as a result of the holiday acquisition  the company offers a much broader range of recreational vehicle products and will likely be more susceptible to recreational vehicle industry cyclicality than in the past 
factors affecting cyclicality in the recreational vehicle industry include fuel availability and fuel prices  prevailing interest rates  the level of discretionary spending  the availability of credit and overall consumer confidence 
in particular  interest rates rose significantly in and while recent interest rates have not had a material adverse effect on the company s business  no assurances can be given that an increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
management of growth as a result of the holiday acquisition  the company has experienced significant growth in the number of its employees  in the size of its manufacturing operations and in the scope of its business 
this growth has resulted in the addition of new management personnel  increased responsibilities for existing management personnel  and has placed added pressure on the company s operating  financial and management information systems 
while management believes it has substantially completed the integration of holiday rambler s operations and personnel into the company  due to the large size of the holiday acquisition relative to the company  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter problems in the future associated with the integration of the acquisition or that the anticipated benefits of the holiday acquisition will be fully realized 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will adequately support and manage the growth of its business and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
manufacturing expansion the company significantly increased its manufacturing capacity in by expanding its elkhart  indiana facility and opening its coburg  oregon facility 
in order to meet market demand and realize manufacturing efficiencies  the company is constructing a new motor coach manufacturing facility in wakarusa  indiana  is relocating its elkhart  indiana motor coach production to the new wakarusa facility  and is also planning to open a springfield  oregon facility to manufacture towables 
the integration of the company s facilities and the expansion of the company s manufacturing operations involve a number of risks including unexpected production difficulties 
in  the company experienced start up inefficiencies in manufacturing the windsor model  and  beginning in  the company experienced difficulty in increasing production rates of motor coaches at its coburg facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully integrate its manufacturing facilities or that it will achieve the anticipated benefits and efficiencies from its expanded manufacturing operations 
in addition  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if sales of the company s products do not increase at a rate sufficient to offset the company s increased expense levels resulting from this expansion 
the set up and scale up of production facilities in wakarusa and springfield involve various risks and uncertainties  including timely performance of a large number of contractors  subcontractors  suppliers and various government agencies that regulate and license construction  each of which is beyond the control of the company 
the set up of the new facilities involves risks and costs associated with the development and acquisition of new production lines  molds and other machinery  the training of employees  and compliance with environmental  health and safety and other regulatory requirements 
the inability of the company to complete the set up of its wakarusa and springfield facilities and to commence full scale commercial production in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  at such time as the company commences production at these new facilities  it may from time to time experience lower than anticipated yields or production constraints that may adversely affect its ability to satisfy customer orders 
any prolonged inability to satisfy customer demand could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
concentration of sales to certain dealers although the company s products were offered by dealerships located primarily in the united states and canada at the end of  a significant percentage of the company s sales have been and will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of independent dealers 
although no single dealer accounted for as much as of the company s net sales in  the top three dealers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in that period 
the loss of a significant dealer or a substantial decrease in sales by such a dealer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business sales and marketing 
potential liability under repurchase agreements as is common in the recreational vehicle industry  the company enters into repurchase agreements with the financing institutions used by its dealers to finance their purchases 
these agreements obligate the company to repurchase a dealer s inventory under certain circumstances in the event of a default by the dealer to its lender 
in  the company s then third largest dealer went into default with its lenders  and the company was required to repurchase motor coaches 
although the company was able to resell these motor coaches within three months  the company incurred expenses of approximately  in connection with this dealer s default 
additionally  the need to resell these motor coaches and the loss of that dealer temporarily limited the company s sales of new motor coaches 
if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of its products in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  business and results of operations 
the company s contingent obligations under repurchase agreements vary from period to period and totaled approximately million as of december   with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
see liquidity and capital resources and note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
availability and cost of fuel an interruption in the supply  or a significant increase in the price or tax on the sale  of diesel fuel or gasoline on a regional or national basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
diesel fuel and gasoline have  at various times in the past  been difficult to obtain  and there can be no assurance that the supply of diesel fuel or gasoline will continue uninterrupted  that rationing will not be imposed  or that the price of or tax on diesel fuel or gasoline will not significantly increase in the future  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on certain suppliers a number of important components for certain of the company s products are purchased from single or limited sources  including its turbo diesel engines cummins  substantially all of its transmissions allison  axles for all diesel motor coaches other than the holiday rambler endeavor diesel model and chassis for certain of its holiday rambler products chevrolet  ford and freightliner 
the company has no long term supply contracts with these suppliers or their distributors  and there can be no assurance that these suppliers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for these components 
although the company believes that adequate alternative suppliers exist for each of these components  an extended delay or interruption in the supply of any of the components currently obtained from a single source supplier or limited supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business manufacturing 
new product introductions the company believes that the introduction of new features and new models will be critical to its future success 
delays in the introduction of new models or product features or a lack of market acceptance of new models or features and or quality problems with new models or features could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  in the third quarter of the company incurred unexpected costs associated with three model changes introduced in that quarter which adversely affected the company s gross margin 
there also can be no assurance that product introductions in the future will not divert revenues from existing models and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company currently competes with a number of other manufacturers of motor coaches  fifth wheel trailers and travel trailers  some of which have significantly greater financial resources and more extensive marketing capabilities than the company 
there can be no assurance that either existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to  or that achieve better consumer acceptance than  the company s products  or that the company will continue to remain competitive 
see business competition 
risks of litigation the company is subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business  including a variety of product liability and warranty claims typical in the recreational vehicle industry 
in addition  as a result of the holiday acquisition  the company assumed most of the liabilities of holiday rambler  including product liability and warranty claims 
although the company does not believe that the outcome of any pending litigation  net of insurance coverage  will have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company  due to the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation  there can be no assurance in this regard 
to date  the company has been successful in obtaining product liability insurance on terms the company considers acceptable 
the company s current policies jointly provide coverage against claims based on occurrences within the policy periods up to a maximum of million for each occurrence and million in the aggregate 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future at acceptable levels or that the costs of insurance will be reasonable 
furthermore  successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
environmental regulation and remediation regulation the company s recreational vehicle manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations relating to the use  generation  storage  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials 
these laws are often revised and made more stringent  and it is likely that future amendments to these laws will impact the company s operations 
the company has submitted applications for title v air permits for its operations in elkhart  indiana and wakarusa  indiana and is in the process of preparing such applications for its facilities in coburg  oregon and the expansion of its operations in wakarusa 
the company has provided the relevant state agency with a schedule of completion for the coburg application  which will be filed after the regulatory deadline  and the agency has indicated to the company that the schedule will be acceptable 
the company does not currently anticipate that any additional air pollution control equipment will be required as a condition of receiving new air permits  although new regulations and their interpretation may change over time  and there can be no assurance that additional expenditures will not be required 
while the company has in the past provided notice to the relevant state agencies that air permit violations have occurred at its facilities  the company has resolved all such issues with those agencies  and the company believes that there are no ongoing violations of any of its existing air permits at any of its owned or leased facilities at this time 
however  the failure of the company to comply with present or future regulations could subject the company to i fines  ii potential civil and criminal liability  iii suspension of production or cessation of operations  iv alterations to the manufacturing process  or v costly clean up or capital expenditures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
remediation the company has identified petroleum and or solvent ground contamination at the elkhart  indiana manufacturing facility  at the wakarusa  indiana manufacturing facility and the leesburg  florida dealership acquired in the holiday acquisition 
the company has remediated the elkhart site and recommended to the relevant indiana regulatory authority that no further action be taken because the remaining contaminants are below the state s clean up standards 
the company currently expects that the regulatory authority will concur with this finding  although there is no assurance that such approval will be forthcoming or that the regulatory authority will not require additional investigation and or remediation 
the company is investigating the wakarusa site and expects soon to recommend to the relevant regulatory authority that no further action be taken at that site based on its consultant s view that there is a limited risk associated with the remaining contamination 
it is unclear whether the regulatory authority will concur in this finding or whether additional remediation will be required 
in florida  the company and its consultants are conducting investigations to determine the appropriate remediation program to recommend to the relevant florida regulatory authority for the contamination associated with former underground storage tanks at the leesburg dealership 
with regard to the wakarusa and leesburg sites  the company is indemnified by harley davidson for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the company subject to a  deductible in the case of the wakarusa site and subject to a million maximum in the case of the wakarusa site and a million maximum in the case of the leesburg site for matters  such as these  that were identified at the closing of the holiday acquisition 
the company does not believe that any costs it will bear with respect to continued investigation or remediation of the foregoing locations and other facilities currently or formerly owned or occupied by the company will have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the company will not discover additional environmental problems or that the cost to the company of the remediation activities will not exceed the company s expectations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities 
during  the company generated net cash from operations of million 
net income and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization generated approximately million of this amount and the balance was generated by increases in accrued expenses and income taxes payable combined with a decrease in trade receivables and inventories  primarily from the sale of seven holiday world dealerships  which more than offset a reduction in deferred income taxes 
in connection with the holiday acquisition  on march   the company replaced its bank line of credit with new credit facilities consisting of a term loan of million the term loan and a revolving line of credit of up to million the revolving loans 
the term loan bears interest at various rates based upon the prime lending rate announced from time to time by banker s trust company the prime rate or libor and is due and payable in full on march  the term loan requires monthly interest payments  quarterly principal payments and certain mandatory prepayments 
the mandatory prepayments consist of i an annual payment on april of each year  beginning april   of seventy five percent of the company s defined excess cash flow for the then most recently ended fiscal year  and ii subsequent to repayment by the company of the million note issued in conjunction with the purchase of the holiday world dealerships which was repaid in full in the third quarter of  a payment  within two days of the sale of any dealership  of the net cash proceeds received by the company from such sale 
at the election of the company  the revolving loans bear interest at variable interest rates based on the prime rate or libor 
at december   the effective interest rates on the revolving loans and the term loan were and  respectively 
the revolving loans are due and payable in full on march   and require monthly interest payments 
as of december   million was outstanding under the term loan and million was outstanding under the revolving loans 
the term loan and the revolving loans are collateralized by a security interest in all of the assets of the company and include various restrictions and financial covenants 
because borrowings under the revolving loans have been less than originally anticipated  the company is currently in the process of negotiating new terms relating to the amount available under the revolving loans and the interest rates  covenants and restrictions relating to both loans 
the company does not expect any adverse changes to the credit facilities as a result of these discussions 
the company also has various loans outstanding to finance retail inventory at the three remaining holiday world dealerships which amounted to approximately million at december  and which bear interest at various rates based on the prime rate and are collateralized by the assets of the company 
the company s principal working capital requirements are for purchases of inventory and  to a lesser extent  financing of trade receivables 
the company s dealers typically finance product purchases under wholesale floor plan arrangements with third parties as described below 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million  an increase of  from working capital of million at december  the company used short term credit facilities to finance the coburg  oregon facility as well as the construction in progress on the new wakarusa facility 
the company primarily used long term debt and the redeemable preferred stock to finance the holiday acquisition 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  primarily for expansion of manufacturing facilities 
in the first quarter of  the company completed spending on the new coburg  oregon manufacturing facility started in during the second half of  construction began on the new manufacturing facility and administrative offices in wakarusa  indiana which will enable the company to increase its production capacity of motor coaches 
the total cost of the wakarusa facility is now estimated to be approximately million  and the plant is expected to be operational by the end of the second quarter of the company believes that cash flow from operations  funds available under its credit facilities and the proceeds of the offering will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in will total approximately to million  of which an estimated million will be used to finish construction of the wakarusa facility  million will be used to set up the springfield  oregon facility and up to million will be used to upgrade the company s management information systems  including software to handle the year issue 
the company may  however  require additional equity or debt financing to address working capital and facilities expansion needs  particularly if the company further expands its operations to address greater than anticipated growth in the market for its products 
the company may also from time to time seek to acquire businesses that would complement the company s current business  and any such acquisition could require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if required or on terms deemed favorable by the company 
as is typical in the recreational vehicle industry  many of the company s retail dealers  including the holiday world dealerships  utilize wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third party lending institutions to finance their purchases of the company s products 
under the terms of these floor plan arrangements  institutional lenders customarily require the recreational vehicle manufacturer to agree to repurchase any unsold units if the dealer fails to meet its commitments to the lender  subject to certain conditions 
the company has agreements with several institutional lenders under which the company currently has repurchase obligations 
the company s contingent obligations under these repurchase agreements are reduced by the proceeds received upon the sale of any repurchased units 
the company s obligations under these repurchase agreements vary from period to period 
at december   approximately million of products sold by the company to independent dealers were subject to potential repurchase under existing floor plan financing agreements  with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of products under any repurchase agreement  its business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected
