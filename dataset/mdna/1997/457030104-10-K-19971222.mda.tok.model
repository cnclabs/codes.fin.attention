the company believes  based on its current results of operations  and financial condition  that the financial resources available  including amounts available under long term financing arrangements  existing bank lines of credit and internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  including any debt servicing required by additional borrowings 
the company believes that its current new store opening  expansion  remodel and or replacement program will not have a material adverse effect on the availability of these financial resources or on the sufficiency of these resources for the purposes described in this report 
however  it is possible that  in the future  the company s results of operations and financial condition will be different from that described in this report based on a number of intangible factors 
these factors may include  among others  increased competition  changing regional and national economic conditions  adverse climatic conditions affecting food production and delivery and changing demographics 
it is also possible  for such reasons  that the results of operations from the new  expanded  remodeled and or replacement stores will not meet or exceed the results of operations from existing stores that are described in this report

sixteen and one half cents per share on its class a common stock and

the company expects to continue paying regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
however  the board of directors periodically reconsiders the declaration of dividends 
the company pays these dividends at the discretion of the board of directors and the continuation of these payments  the amount of such dividends and the form in which the dividends are paid cash or stock depends upon the results of operations  the financial condition of the company and other factors which the board of directors deems relevant 
insurance the company maintains general liability  automobile and excess liability coverages 
the company carries million liability insurance coverage on one aircraft and million liability insurance coverage on three other aircraft used in its business

risks and uncertainties are associated with self insurance  however  the company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverages 
the company believes that its mix between insurance and self insurance is prudent  is in accordance with general industry practice and is in the best interest of the company 
self insurance reserves are established for workers compensation and employee group medical and dental benefits based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported  with a maximum per occurrence of  for workers compensation and up to a maximum of  per covered person for medical care benefits for a policy year 
the company is insured for covered costs in excess of these limits

impact of inflation inflation in food prices during fiscal years  and continued to be lower than the overall increase in the consumer price index 
ingles primary costs  inventory and labor  increase with inflation

in primary earnings per common share for fiscal years and and an increase of 
in primary earnings per common share for fiscal year statement would not impact the calculation of fully diluted earnings per common share for fiscal and  however  fully diluted earnings per common share for fiscal would increase by
