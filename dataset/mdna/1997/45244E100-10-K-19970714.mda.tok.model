item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background 
since october  urohealth through new management has been transformed from a research and development company into a fully integrated medical products company 
historical growth through acquisitions  pooling and purchase accounting 
the mergers of dacomed and allstate were completed on july   the acquisitions of osbon and advanced closed on december  and the acquisition of microsurge was completed on march  the operations of urohealth are presented on a combined basis historically  as these transactions were all accounted for as poolings of interests 
on may   urohealth acquired endoscopic imaging systems  inc and on june  and june  urohealth acquired intermed and the minimally invasive surgery product lines of or concepts  respectively 
all three of these transactions were accounted for as purchases and are included in urohealth s financials as of the date of the acquisitions 
on august   urohealth acquired richard allan and on february   urohealth acquired x cardia 
these acquisitions were also accounted for as purchases  therefore  the results from richard allan have been included commencing august  and the results of x cardia have been included from february   the date each acquisition closed  respectively 
integration of acquisitions  restructuring charges 
the company has recorded significant direct acquisition costs  write off of purchased research and development and other charges related primarily to the company s acquisitions which have adversely impacted operating results during the periods discussed below 
the restructuring charges related primarily to personnel reduction costs and facility reduction costs  as well as write downs of acquired assets to their estimated net realizable value 
for the year ended march   these charges totaled million  consisting of million related to the write down of purchased incomplete research and development costs  million of restructuring charges  million of merger and acquisition costs  and million of extraordinary items 
the company anticipates cost savings in future periods relating to restructuring plans implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily relating to the elimination of certain administrative finance and assembly functions in augusta  georgia at its urology division and in connection with cost savings relating to utilizing the company s in house molding capabilities for recently acquired products 
as a result of the foregoing  urohealth s fiscal results are not necessarily comparable to prior periods 
the fiscal results also may not be comparable due to  among other reasons  the pooling of results of operations of merged entities for periods during which such entities were operated under a different management team and the acquisitions completed in fiscal and accounted for as purchase transactions 
in addition  historical results are not necessarily indicative of  nor will they be comparable to  the financial results urohealth will realize in future periods 
change in fiscal year end 
in  urohealth changed its fiscal year end from june to march  therefore  the following discussion for fiscal compares the year ended march  with the months ended march  and fiscal compares the nine month transition period ending march  to the corresponding period of the prior year 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales 
net sales during the months ended march  fiscal or increased million  or  over the twelve months ended march  this increase was primarily due to higher sales of urohealth s urology products which increased million  or  to million  the purchase of richard allan on august  which increased revenues by approximately million and the acquisition of microsurge in march which increased revenues by million 
in addition  the company shipped approximately million of surgical products to distributors during fiscal as part of initial stocking orders 
revenues from these initial stocking orders are expected to be recognized in fiscal net sales of the company s urology products  minimally invasive and general surgery products  and medical surgical products represented  and  respectively  of net sales for the year ended march  gross profit 
gross profit during increased million  or  over the months ended march  the gross profit percentage was in and for the months ended march  the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to a change in the mix of products sold and the write off of discontinued product inventory of approximately million 
during the months ended march   the company s higher margin urology products accounted for of sales  decreasing to of sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses during increased by million  or  compared to the months ended march  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was related to increased sales levels and the selling  general and administrative expenses of richard allan and microsurge which were acquired during fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the twelve months ended march  from for the corresponding period in the company implemented a restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal at its augusta  georgia urology division to eliminate administrative functions  finance functions and assembly operations  which should result in a reduction of selling  general and administration expenses relating to those operations 
research and development 
research and development expenses during increased million  or  over the months ended march  the increase was largely due to the company devoting additional resources to accelerate the development of new products for its gynecology and visualization product lines 
write off of purchased research and development 
subsequent to the acquisition of richard allan and x cardia  a study was conducted to determine the proper allocation of the purchase price for each of these acquisitions 
an independent valuation of assets acquired was performed and used as an aid in determining the fair market value of each identifiable tangible and intangible asset and in allocating the purchase price among the acquired assets  including the portion of the purchase price properly attributed to incomplete research and development projects that should be expensed 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company made acquisitions of technologies under development that were also accounted for or purchased research and development and written off 
accordingly  million  million and million have been expensed in connection with the acquisitions of richard allan  x cardia and other technology purchases  respectively 
restructuring charges 
in september  the company established a restructuring plan to eliminate redundant manufacturing facilities resulting from the richard allan  intermed and or concepts acquisitions and their consolidation with some of the company s existing manufacturing locations 
this restructuring is expected to be completed within one year except for redundant facilities  lease costs and payments under certain severance agreements that may continue over their terms 
the company has provided a restructuring charge of million  of which all are cash expenditures 
this restructuring includes severance costs for approximately employees  certain facility closures and elimination of other redundant selling and administrative costs 
although subject to future adjustment  management of the company believes that restructuring reserves as of march  are adequate to complete the restructuring 
beginning balance at restructuring non cash cash march  accrual charges charges reclassifications in thousands personnel reduction costs   facility reduction costs   in march  the company implemented a restructuring plan to consolidate redundant facilities and reduce personnel resulting from the mergers with osbon and microsurge 
the plan provides for the elimination of approximately personnel and the closure of all significant operations at osbon except for customer service  sales and a limited accounting support staff and the closure of all microsurge facilities 
the estimated cost associated with each component of this restructuring plan and the cash and non cash charges incurred during fiscal are summarized in the table below 
non cash charges consist of the write down of existing assets to their estimated net realizable value 
although subject to future adjustment  management of the company believes that restructuring reserves as of march  are adequate to complete the restructuring in thousands 
beginning balance at restructuring non cash cash march  accrual charges charges in thousands personnel reduction costs    facility reduction costs it is possible that the company will undertake additional restructuring in fiscal or thereafter as it continues to execute its business plan or as a result of additional acquisitions 
direct acquisition costs 
merger and acquisition costs during decreased million  or  over the months ended march   the decrease was primarily due to acquisitions completed in fiscal being recorded as purchase transactions which provides for the capitalization of acquisition costs as opposed to expensing these costs incurred in transactions accounted for as pooling of interests 
these transaction costs include expenses related to broker and other professional fees 
interest expense 
interest expense during increased by approximately million  or  over the months ended march   this increase was primarily due to increased borrowings under term loans and lines of credit and the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debentures during the second and third quarters of fiscal nine months ended march  compared to nine months ended march  net sales 
net sales during the nine months ended march  fiscal or increased million or over the nine months ended march  primarily due to an increase in sales of urohealth s urological products 
urohealth s vacuum erection devices accounted for and of sales for and  respectively 
urohealth continued to increase its sales force and maintained an aggressive advertising campaign  contributing to the sales growth 
gross profit 
gross profit during increased million or over the same period in the gross margin was in and in there were no significant changes in urohealth s product mix or product pricing between periods 
urohealth closed two facilities in and improved operating efficiencies  the effect of which was primarily realized in the last quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses during increased million or over the same period in this increase was primarily due to increases in sales and marketing expenses as urohealth continued to build a sales organization 
also  general and administrative costs increased due to the addition of key management personnel and expenses associated with the integration of its four operating locations 
research and development 
research and development expenses during decreased million or in over the same period in overall  the decline in research and development costs was a result of urohealth s decision to narrow the focus of such efforts  and to adopt a program of actively acquiring or licensing developed technology 
in connection with the acquisition of laparomed corporation on july   urohealth expensed million of purchased research and development 
the laparomed corporation acquisition has been accounted for as purchase with a purchase price of approximately million 
restructuring charges 
in december  urohealth implemented a restructuring plan to consolidate redundant facilities and reduce personnel resulting from the mergers with dacomed  osbon and advanced 
under the plan  urohealth eliminated approximately manufacturing  engineering and administrative personnel and closed all operations at two acquired facilities 
the estimated cost associated with each component of this restructuring plan and the cash and non cash charges incurred during fiscal are summarized in the table below 
non cash charges consist of the write down of existing assets to their estimated net realizable value 
reclassifications during the period relate to decreases in severance amounts payable to officers of acquired companies  offset by increases in estimates for facility closure costs including loss on sale of discontinued product lines and closure costs related to international operations of acquired companies 
the remaining restructuring accrual at march  relates primarily to terminated employee severance and facility lease obligations  which are expected to be paid in cash 
although subject to future adjustment  management of urohealth believes that restructuring reserves as of march  are adequate to complete the restructuring 
beginning balance at restructuring non cash cash reclassi march  accrual charges charges fications in thousands personnel reduction costs   facility reduction costs     direct acquisition costs 
merger and acquisition costs during increased million over the same period in the results of operations in reflect additional transaction costs of million related to urohealth s mergers with osbon  advanced and dacomed 
these transaction costs include expenses related to broker and other professional fees 
interest expense 
interest expense during increased by approximately  or over the same period in  primarily due to the issuance of the debentures as well as increased borrowings under term loans and lines of credit 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiary expenses related to minority interest were   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
such expenses consist of dividends payable to stockholders of preferred stock of a urohealth subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources in april  urohealth completed the sale of million of its senior subordinated notes due the notes raising net proceeds of approximately million 
urohealth used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay amount outstanding under urohealth s term and revolving credit facility 
concurrently with the consummation of the sale of the notes  urohealth entered into a new million revolving credit facility with urohealth s senior lender the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and matures in march the company is required to meet certain financial covenants under the senior credit facility and available amounts under the revolving credit facility are based on eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
as of june   urohealth had no amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility 
as of march   urohealth had working capital of approximately million  adjusted for the sale of the notes 
the company used million of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase government securities the pledged securities which have been pledged for the benefit of the holders of the notes 
the scheduled principal and interest payments on the pledged securities is in an amount sufficient to pay when due the first three semi annual scheduled interest payments on the notes 
during fiscal  the company is obligated to repay at maturity approximately million of notes and accrued interest assumed in the acquisition of microsurge 
in addition  the company is obligated to pay million to the former x cardia shareholders upon achievement of a patent approval milestone  the likelihood and timing of which cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
however  it is reasonably possible that such milestone payment could become payable in fiscal approximately million of urohealth s restructuring charges are projected to be paid over the next months 
the long term portion consists of redundant facility lease costs to be paid out through and severance costs to be paid out over the next two years 
urohealth currently expects to pay these restructuring charges from cash flow from operations or from financing activities 
urohealth had capital expenditures for the nine months ended march  and the year ended march  of million and million  respectively  primarily due to the consolidation and expansion of manufacturing and upgrade of management information systems 
urohealth currently has a million commitment for a corporate aircraft and anticipates capital expenditures  primarily for increased manufacturing capacity and information systems  for the next months will exceed million 
the company is a holding company whose material assets consist primarily of the capital stock of its subsidiaries 
consequently  the company is dependent upon dividends paid by its subsidiaries to pay the company s operating expenses and to service the company s debt obligations  including its obligations under the notes and the senior credit facility 
except for applicable restrictions under state corporate laws  there are currently no restrictions on any of the subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to the company 
through march  urohealth has continued to have negative cash flow from operations  primarily due to increases in operating losses  accounts receivable and inventories 
operating losses increased for the reasons discussed previously in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
urohealth s accounts receivable balances increased by approximately million during the year ended march  primarily due to the acquisition of richard allan accounts receivable which were not included in the prior fiscal year 
management anticipates further increases in accounts receivable in  possibly also on extended payment terms  as sales volume under a number of distribution agreements increases 
urohealth s inventory balances increased by approximately million during the year ended march  due to new product introductions  the acquisition of richard allan and an increase in inventory levels to support increased sales volume 
urohealth expects further increases in inventories to support anticipated sales under group purchasing organization and distribution agreements 
cash used in operations totaled approximately million for the year ended march  during this period  urohealth s operations have been funded primarily from the proceeds of debt and equity offerings  including the sale of million of convertible subordinated debentures and the sale of  shares of the urohealth s common stock 
urohealth believes that the net proceeds from the currently available cash balances  amounts available under the senior credit facility  and funds generated from operations will provide adequate liquidity to finance its operations for the next months 
urohealth s business strategy includes efforts to expand business operations through the acquisition of new products  product lines and businesses 
business acquisitions may continue to be financed through the issuance of shares of urohealth s common stock and other financing activities 
however  there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be consummated 
should urohealth not be able to obtain such financing  urohealth will be required to proceed with its planned expansion at a slower rate 
urohealth may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity and or debt financings or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to urohealth 
factors affecting future operating performance significant leverage 
urohealth has substantial indebtedness and significant debt service obligations 
at march   on a pro forma basis to reflect the private placement in april by urohealth of million of its senior subordinated notes the notes the note offering  urohealth would have had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  approximately million of total assets  approximately million of total tangible assets and approximately million of stockholders equity 
urohealth s ability to pay interest on the notes and to satisfy its other debt obligations will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond its control  as well as the availability of borrowings under its existing credit facility the credit facility or successor credit facilities 
urohealth will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness as well as future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
urohealth historically and  on a pro forma basis for the year ended march   has had negative cash flow from operations 
in order to have positive cash flow from operations and meet its various financial requirements  including debt service  urohealth must experience substantial growth and improvements in its results of operations 
there can be no assurance that urohealth will have positive cash flow from operations in the future 
if urohealth is unable to meet its cash requirements out of cash flow from operations or from available borrowings  there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain alternative financing or that it will be permitted to do so under the terms of the credit facility  the indenture relating to the notes the note indenture  or other debt instruments 
in the absence of such financing  urohealth s ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or research and development may be adversely affected 
finally  it is anticipated that in order to pay the principal balance of the notes due at maturity  urohealth will have to obtain alternative financing 
urohealth s high degree of leverage could have important consequences including  without limitation  the following i a substantial portion of urohealth s net cash provided by operations will be committed to the payment of urohealth s interest expense and principal repayment obligations and will not be available to urohealth for its operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  ii urohealth s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited  iii urohealth will be more highly leveraged than certain of its competitors  which may place it at a disadvantage and limit urohealth s flexibility in reacting to changes in its business  and iv urohealth s borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates  which could result in higher interest expense if interest rates rise 
operating losses  no assurance of profitability  liquidity 
urohealth reported net losses for its fiscal year ended june   for the nine months ended march  and the year ended march  of million  million and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that urohealth will be profitable in any future period 
the net cash used in operating activities by urohealth for its fiscal year ended june   for the nine months ended march  and for the year ended march  was million  million and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the operating activities of the company will generate sufficient cash flow to meet its liquidity needs in any future period 
the future capital requirements of the company will depend upon many factors  including the success of its sales and marketing efforts  new product development  and future acquisitions of companies and products 
the company believes that the net proceeds from the note offering  together with borrowings under the credit facility and funds expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to fund operations for the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not require additional financing during such time 
further  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to urohealth on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  other than certain permitted indebtedness under the note indenture  including indebtedness under the credit facility  urohealth will need improvement in results of operations in order to incur additional indebtedness under the terms of the note indenture 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate its acquisition and product development efforts  which could have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business  results of operations or financial condition 
limitations imposed by certain indebtedness 
the documents governing the indebtedness of urohealth including the note indenture and the credit facility contain significant covenants that limit urohealth s and its subsidiaries ability to engage in various transactions and  in the case of the credit facility  require satisfaction of specified financial performance criteria 
in addition  under each of the foregoing documents  the occurrence of certain events including  without limitation  failure to comply with the foregoing covenants  material inaccuracies of representations and warranties  certain defaults under or acceleration of other indebtedness and events of bankruptcy or insolvency would  in certain cases after notice and grace periods  constitute an event of default permitting acceleration of the indebtedness covered by such documents 
the limitations imposed by the documents governing the outstanding indebtedness of urohealth and its subsidiaries are substantial  and failure to comply with them could have a material adverse effect on urohealth and its subsidiaries 
future operating results dependent on products 
the future operating results of the company will be dependent upon its ability to increase sales of existing medical products and the continued acceptance of such products by the medical community and third party payors as useful and cost effective 
historically  urohealth has been highly dependent on the sale of vacuum erection devices for the treatment of male impotence 
the market for medical products is characterized by rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
in particular  competition in the market for treatment of male impotence is especially intense and has increased substantially in recent years 
competitors and others may develop and introduce new products  devices or approaches for treatment of the conditions targeted by urohealth that could render one or more of urohealth s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
the future operating results of the company will also be dependent  therefore  upon its ability to develop or acquire new products that are competitive in the markets it serves 
product acceptance will depend upon many factors  including the continued demonstration of the utility and cost effectiveness of products of the company  the maintenance of regulatory clearance in the united states and elsewhere and the continued availability of third party reimbursement 
failure of one or more of urohealth s products to continue to be accepted by the medical community or the inability to develop new products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
substantially all of urohealth s medical product sales are derived from medical products of companies that urohealth has acquired 
as urohealth has acquired businesses and technologies  it has acquired a number of related products under development which will require additional research and development efforts by urohealth in an attempt to bring such products to market 
while members of management of urohealth have experience in developing products internally  urohealth has not historically developed a significant number of medical products internally 
there can be no assurance that urohealth s medical products will be successfully developed and marketed  that required regulatory approvals from the food and drug administration fda or equivalent foreign authorities for any indication will be obtained or that any products  if produced  will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs  that such future products will be brought to market in a timely manner or that existing products will generate significant sales  the failure of any of which could have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business  operating results or financial condition 
concentration of credit risk  extended payment terms 
urohealth sells several product lines that are considered capital equipment by hospitals and other purchasers 
from time to time  urohealth offers certain customers extended payment terms to facilitate sales of these products 
urohealth may in the future grant similar extended payment terms 
for the year ended march   sales that urohealth made pursuant to extended payment terms were approximately of total sales 
urohealth s typical payment terms require payment from to days 
as of march   urohealth had a total of million of accounts receivable on extended payment terms with integrated medical resources  inc imr for sales of urohealth s rigiscan product pursuant to terms under which the payments are due over months 
over the twelve month period ended march   urohealth sold approximately million of products to imr on extended terms 
imr is a public company traded on the nasdaq under the symbol imri 
for its most recent fiscal year ended december   imr reported a loss of million 
bruce hazuka  executive vice president chief operating officer for urohealth  is a member of the board of directors of imr 
uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement 
in the united states  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians  that purchase urohealth s products and other medical devices  generally rely on third party payors  including private health insurance plans and federal medicare and state medicaid  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the medical device is being used 
reimbursement has traditionally been available in the united states for vacuum erection devices manufactured by urohealth and sold by prescription to patients under a specific reimbursement code 
the majority of the remaining urohealth products are used in procedures for which reimbursement is generally available  however  there are no specific reimbursement codes for urohealth s products 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available for procedures performed using urohealth s existing products or future products 
in the event that reimbursement is not available for procedures using such products  the market acceptance for such products in the united states could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  certain health care providers are moving toward a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per covered individual 
urohealth is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods utilized by third party health care payors  and urohealth could be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private health care payors  particularly to the extent any such changes affect reimbursement for procedures in which its products are used 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of urohealth s products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from health care payors for procedures in which their products are used or adverse changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures would have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business  financial condition and results of operations 
market acceptance of urohealth s products in international markets may be dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored and private health insurance 
there can be no assurance that any international reimbursement approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  or at all 
failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have a material adverse effect on market acceptance of urohealth s products in international markets and therefore could have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth 
urohealth s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on its financial  operational and management resources 
in addition  in order to meet expected growth  urohealth expects to add administrative and other personnel and manufacturing capacity  and make additional investments in operations and systems 
there can be no assurance that urohealth will be able to find and train such personnel  or to do so on a timely basis  or to expand its operations and manufacturing capacity to the extent and in the time required 
continued growth in sales  including sales under new group purchasing organization and distributor agreements  would require urohealth carefully to manage production capacity and inventory levels  as well as quality controls  to meet increasing product demand and new product introductions 
urohealth has already experienced rapid growth in its inventory levels in anticipation of increased sales 
inaccuracies in demand forecasts could result in insufficient or excessive capacity or inventories and disproportionate overhead expenses 
failure to adequately manage growth  including any unexpected costs  delays  quality control issues or inefficiencies incurred or encountered in connection with such management of growth could have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business  operating results or financial condition 
integration of acquired operations 
urohealth recently acquired x cardia and microsurge 
urohealth currently intends to integrate the operations of those acquired entities with its own operations 
no assurance can be given that the benefits expected from such integration will be realized 
in addition  urohealth will be subject to the risks that such recently acquired operations and future acquisitions will not perform as expected and that the earnings from such operations will not be sufficient to support the capital expenditures needed to develop such operations in conformity with urohealth s strategy 
any delays or unexpected costs incurred in connection with such integration could have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business  operating results or financial condition 
future acquisitions 
an important element of urohealth s strategy is to identify and acquire businesses and product lines 
urohealth actively seeks acquisition opportunities in the regular course of its business and is engaged in ongoing evaluations of and discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions certain of which  if consummated  could be material 
since july  urohealth has acquired a number of medical product companies and product lines and has acquired or licensed additional technology 
as a result of those acquisitions  urohealth has experienced rapid growth 
urohealth expects to continue to acquire additional products and companies in the future 
there can be no assurance that urohealth will be able to implement or sustain its acquisition strategy or that its strategy will ultimately prove profitable to urohealth 
urohealth will likely be required to issue additional shares of common stock  incur additional debt or to use a portion of its cash balances to make such future acquisitions 
in addition  the terms of the note indenture and the terms of other indebtedness may restrict urohealth s ability to pursue and consummate future acquisitions 
reliance on patents and proprietary rights 
the commercial success and future revenue growth of urohealth will depend  in part  on its ability to operate without infringing on the rights of others both in the united states and abroad and not breaching technology licenses that cover technology used in its products 
urohealth owns or has authority to use united states and foreign patent rights with respect to some of its medical products and have filed  and expects in the future to file  additional patent applications 
it is uncertain whether any third party patents will require urohealth to develop alternative technology or to alter its products or processes  obtain licenses or cease certain activities 
if such licenses are required  there can be no assurance that urohealth will be able to obtain such licenses on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
failure by urohealth to obtain a license to any technology that it may require to commercialize its products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
urohealth recently acquired x cardia which has filed patent applications with respect to its cardiac output monitoring technology 
there can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of the protection that may be afforded by any such patents  or whether any such applications ultimately may be approved resulting in the issuance of patents 
urohealth believes that some measure of patent protection with respect to its products will be required to allow it to compete with large medical products companies 
there can be no assurance that urohealth will continue to develop or acquire products or processes that are patentable or that patents applied for will be issued or that any patents issued to or licensed by urohealth will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide it with competitive advantages 
in addition  urohealth could incur substantial costs in defending its proprietary rights and there can be no assurance that a competitor s technology or product would be found to infringe such rights 
although urohealth believes that its patents are valid  there can be no assurance that the validity of any patent will be upheld if asserted by urohealth against any party 
further  there can be no assurances as to the breadth and degree of protection that will be afforded urohealth s patent rights or that other companies will not independently develop similar but non infringing competitive products 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect urohealth s proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition  there is currently pending before congress legislation providing for changes to the patent law which may adversely affect the patent and proprietary rights of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biomedical firms 
if such pending legislation is adopted  the extent to which such changes would affect the operations of the company cannot be ascertained 
the patents or proprietary rights of others may have an adverse effect on the ability of urohealth to do business in the future 
urohealth may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of other parties in order to produce and sell certain of its products 
no assurance can be given that urohealth s technology can be developed and commercialized without a license to such patents or proprietary rights or that any licenses required under any such patent or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to urohealth  if at all 
if urohealth does not obtain or maintain such licenses  it could encounter delays in product introductions while it attempts to design around or contest the validity of such patents  or urohealth could find that the development  manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be foreclosed  any of which could have a material adverse effect on urohealth 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that competitors or potential competitors will not independently develop similar or alternative products to those of urohealth  duplicate any of urohealth s products or technologies  or design around the patented technologies developed by urohealth or its licensors  any of which could have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business  results of operations or financial condition 
urohealth also relies on trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently create substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise gain access to or disclose such information of urohealth 
it is urohealth s policy to require certain of its employees  contractors and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements to protect its unpatented proprietary technology and know how 
there can be no assurance that such confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that urohealth would have adequate remedy for such breach  or that urohealth s trade secrets will not otherwise become known through independent discovery by competitors 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  urohealth s business may be adversely affected by competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology 
regulatory matters 
most of urohealth s medical products are subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by  among other governmental entities  the united states food and drug administration fda and corresponding agencies of state and foreign countries in which urohealth sell its products 
the process of receiving governmental approval may take a number of years and the expenditure of substantial resources 
there can be no assurance that even after such time and expenditures  regulatory approval will be obtained for any of the products developed by urohealth 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed 
further  discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or its manufacturing facilities may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the public health services act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  recordkeeping  approval  advertising and promotion of such products 
product development and approvals within this regulatory framework take a number of years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources 
noncompliance with applicable requirements may have a material adverse effect on urohealth and can result in fines  warning letters  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal by the government to approve product license applications or allow urohealth to enter into supply contracts  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to revoke product licenses and establishment licenses previously granted 
failure to comply with present or future regulatory requirements  or respond to the new information reflecting on the safety or effectiveness of an approved product  can lead the fda to withdraw its approval to market a product 
urohealth and imagyn incur substantial costs in complying with regulatory requirements 
the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval pma prior to being introduced into the market 
the k premarket notification clearance process is significantly quicker and less costly than the pma process 
substantially all of urohealth s fda marketing clearances have been obtained through the fda s k process  however  certain other products will require pmas 
the pma process is significantly more complex and time consuming than the k notification process 
the pma process may take several years or longer and requires the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information 
urohealth believes that it is in material compliance with the fda s k requirements for new and modified devices 
the fda has announced a program to review approvals k s and pmas for certain devices 
there can be no assurance that upon any such review the fda will agree with urohealth s determination regarding its k s 
if the fda were to disallow a k marketing clearance for any device  urohealth could be required to file appropriate applications  either k or pma  with the fda or to take the products in question off the market 
if the fda were to require suspension of the sale of one or more of the products pending receipt of k clearance or if the fda were to refuse to grant k clearance  urohealth s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that urohealth will obtain timely regulatory approval for its future products  or that existing approvals will not be withdrawn 
moreover  regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
competition 
the markets in which urohealth operates are very competitive and are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and product obsolescence 
urohealth believes that its ability to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements is and will be critical to its continued growth 
there are a substantial number of medical products companies and such companies could develop or offer products which would compete with products which urohealth currently markets or intends to market 
some of these companies have marketing and distribution capabilities  and many of them have capital resources and research and development staffs  substantially greater than those of urohealth 
moreover  it is reasonable to expect additional entrants into the field 
any of these companies could introduce competing products  which could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of existing or future products of urohealth or the combined companies 
there can be no assurances that technological change will not place one or more of urohealth s existing or future products at a competitive disadvantage 
in addition  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition that could materially adversely affect urohealth s business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that urohealth will be able to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on management 
the success of urohealth will depend on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
in particular  the loss of charles a 
laverty  urohealth s chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business if a suitable replacement could not be found 
urohealth has an employment agreement with mr 
laverty that provides for a three year term expiring on april  the agreement automatically renews for additional three year terms if not terminated by either party by prior notice 
urohealth has key person insurance on the life of mr 
laverty in the amount of million  however  there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to compensate urohealth for his absence 
there can be no assurance that urohealth will be successful in attracting or retaining key personnel 
products liability exposure 
the medical products manufactured by urohealth have from time to time become the subject of products liability litigation initiated by the patients using the products 
in addition  as additional products of urohealth enter the market  the company will be subject to an increased risk of products liability claims 
while urohealth believes that its products have been manufactured in accordance with industry standards  and believes it has maintained adequate products liability insurance coverage  any adverse claim or series of claims or adverse publicity resulting from a claim  regardless of whether such claims are covered by insurance  could have a material adverse effect on urohealth s business  results of operations or financial condition 
potential tax liability 
in connection with the redomestication of urohealth from canada to the state of delaware in july  urohealth has filed a final canadian tax return reporting the deemed sale of assets of davstar industries ltd 
the canadian parent company 
urohealth anticipates that the canadian tax authorities will review the tax status of the former entity  davstar industries ltd  as a result of its redomestication from canada to the united states and believes that all or at least a significant amount of any potential canadian tax liability arising from the redomestication would be offset against urohealth s canadian loss carryforwards 
however  the canadian tax authorities could attempt to assign a greater value to urohealth than used in urohealth s estimates  which could result in some amount of canadian tax that cannot be presently determined being assessed in a future period 
no provision for any liability that may result from the ultimate resolution of this tax matter has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of urohealth 
limitation on use of tax net operating loss carryovers 
as of march   urohealth had accumulated net operating loss carryovers for us federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
these loss carryovers would expire  if not previously utilized against income of urohealth  in various years through the future income tax benefit of these losses has not been given recognition in the consolidated financial statements 
under section of the united states internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and corresponding provisions of state tax law  certain ownership changes with respect to the stock of a corporation having unused net operating loss carryovers a loss corporation  or with respect to the stock of its parent corporation  may result in annual limitations on utilizations of such loss carryovers against future income of the loss corporation 
in connection with the acquisition of osbon medical systems ltd 
in december  an ownership change occurred for purposes of section of the code  thereby subjecting urohealth to annual limitations on its ability to offset its existing loss carryovers against its future income 
in connection with the acquisition of microsurge on march   an additional ownership change may have occurred 
urohealth believes this additional ownership change will not reduce the december  section limitation  but will place limitations on the maximum annual utilization of operating loss carryforwards generated subsequent to such date 
warrants and options  potential dilution and adverse impact on additional financing 
urohealth has a significant number of outstanding options and warrants 
in addition  in may and july  urohealth issued million of urohealth s convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures which are convertible into urohealth common stock at a conversion price  subject to adjustment  of per share 
the holders of the debentures would be entitled to receive  shares of common stock if such holders elected to convert all of the debentures into common stock 
to the extent that the outstanding options and warrants are exercised  or convertible securities are converted  dilution of the interests of urohealth s stockholders may occur 
the existence of such warrants  options and convertible securities may adversely affect the terms on which urohealth can obtain additional financing  and the holders of such warrants  options and convertible securities can be expected to exercise them at a time when urohealth would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain additional capital by an offering of its unissued capital stock on terms more favorable to urohealth than those provided by such warrants  options and convertible securities 
rights agreements  anti takeover effects 
urohealth has adopted a preferred share purchase rights plan  pursuant to a rights agreement dated as of may  the rights agreement 
the rights agreement provides for the type of plan commonly called a poison pill 
the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts 
however  the rights agreement could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of urohealth even if a majority of urohealth s stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition  and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of urohealth or to change existing management 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of urohealth s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  general trends in the market for healthcare products  and other factors 
in addition  broad market fluctuations as well as general economic or political conditions such as healthcare reform may adversely affect the market price of the urohealth common stock  regardless of urohealth s actual operating performance 
the market price of urohealth s common stock has historically been very volatile 
absence of dividends 
urohealth has never paid any cash dividends and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  urohealth is restricted in its ability to pay dividends under outstanding credit facilities
