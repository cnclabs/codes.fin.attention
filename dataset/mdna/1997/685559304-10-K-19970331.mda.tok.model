the company s working capital ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  all losses and obligations of the apparel businesses have been provided for in the december  financial statements and  accordingly  the company does not anticipate using any significant portion of its resources towards these apparel businesses 
during the fourth quarter of  the company commenced discussions with the company s factor to convert the amounts due to the factor from the company s discontinued us apparel operations to a term loan

inflation has not materially impacted the operations of the company 
certain material trends despite continued profitability in  the company continues to face a difficult business environment with continuing pressure on the company s prices for its sole source sales and a general reduction in the level of funding for the defense sector 
based on current delivery schedules and as a result of the acquisition of behlman  however  revenues for the company should be sustained at the levels recorded in  although there can be no assurance that such increased revenues will actually be achieved 
the company continues to seek new contracts which require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and preproduction costs 
while the company attempts to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by the government for such effort 
in addition  even if the government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun which may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once the company has completed the design and preproduction stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
the company is heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income 
world events have led the government of the united states to reevaluate the level of military spending necessary for national security 
any significant reductions in the level of military spending by the federal government could have a negative impact on the company s future revenues and earnings 
in addition  due to major consolidations in the defense industry  it has become more difficult to avoid dependence on certain customers for revenue and income 
behlman s product line gives the company some diversity with its line of commercial products
