pamida holdings corporation and subsidiary management s discussion and analysis dollar amounts in thousands year ended february  compared to year ended january  sales as discussed in note o to the financial statements  the company closed forty stores at the end of fiscal in unprofitable or highly competitive markets which did not fit the company s niche market strategy 
consequently  the company experienced a planned decrease in total sales for fiscal of  or compared to fiscal due primarily to the reduced number of stores 
during fiscal the company opened eight new prototype stores  of which six are located in new markets and two were relocations  the company also closed two stores  resulting in a net increase in selling area during the fiscal year of approximately  square feet not including changes relating to the forty stores closed as of fiscal year end to a total of  square feet 
as of february   the company s store base included of the company s most recent store prototype  which represented of the company s total selling square feet 
comparable store sales during the week fiscal period decreased by  or from the week fiscal period 
comparable store sales on a week to week basis decreased by 
sales were affected primarily by slowed warehouse distributions to stores as a result of the implementation of a new warehouse inventory management system initiated in the first quarter of fiscal the slowed distributions caused a deterioration of merchandise in stock positions in most of the company s stores  resulting in lost sales 
while implementation of the warehouse system was largely completed by august  and in stock positions at the stores improved thereafter  sales remained below management expectations due to reduced customer traffic continuing in the third and fourth quarters 
comparable sales also were affected during much of the year by low margin clearance sales in fiscal which were not necessary at the same level in fiscal however  beginning late in the holiday shopping season and continuing through fiscal year end  sales improved as the company demonstrated to customers its improved in stock position in all product categories 
the company experienced substantial comparable store sales increases in fiscal in several merchandise categories  the most dramatic of which were in the pharmacy prescription  junior apparel  grocery and ready to wear areas 
comparable store sales gains also were generated in the hosiery  team sports  camera  stationery  health aids and bath categories 
the company experienced comparable store sales decreases in several categories 
the largest dollar decreases on a comparable store basis were in the electronics  automotive  misses bottoms  men s shoes  electrical and appliance areas 
management believes that subtle adjustments made to the company s softlines strategy at the end of fiscal to meet customer demand for a deeper selection of basic apparel had a positive impact on sales and margins in softlines during fiscal gross profit gross profit dollars were affected by the reduced number of stores in operation during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s merchandise gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to in fiscal from in fiscal however  this improvement was diluted by additional costs related to the implementation of the new warehouse inventory management system discussed above 
warehouse costs increased to  from  last year and increased as a percent of sales to from last year 
delivery costs decreased to  in fiscal from  last year and amounted to of sales in both years 
accordingly  gross profit decreased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal but  as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to from last year 
this reduction was largely attributable to reductions in store level expenses 
store payroll  controllable and occupancy expenses accounted for of the total decrease in selling  general and administrative expense and decreased by  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense also was positively impacted by a reduction in advertising costs which accounted for of the gross decrease in selling  general and administrative expense 
all of these areas of expense were impacted by the elimination of costs related to the forty stores which were closed as of the end of fiscal selling  general and administrative expense also was impacted by an decrease in corporate general and administrative costs which accounted for of the gross decreases in selling  general and administrative expense 
the major components of this decrease were decreases in the net costs of insurance  professional fees  management bonuses and related fringe benefits 
selling  general and administrative expense also was positively impacted by the elimination of amortization of goodwill and favorable leasehold interests resulting from the write off of these items in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decreases in selling  general and administrative expense were offset by a  reduction in other income which was attributable largely to one time gains realized in fiscal  primarily from the sale of idle transportation company assets 
the company is continuing to focus on controlling selling  general and administrative expenses 
store operating expenses as a percent of sales are anticipated to remain relatively constant in fiscal certain expense categories are anticipated to increase somewhat as a percent of sales due to more normal clearance activity and expected increases in interest expense  information systems costs  store payroll expenses due to federally mandated minimum wage increases and incentive compensation 
the company expects to begin to realize operating efficiencies from systems enhancements in the warehouse and distribution areas in fiscal and in the merchandising areas beginning in the second half of fiscal further expense leveraging is expected in future years through internal growth as well as the addition of new stores 
interest expense increased marginally by or for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense for fiscal was attributable primarily to higher usage of the revolving line of credit and to the outstanding promissory notes of the company which require quarterly compounding interest payments to be paid in kind 
these increases were largely offset by decreased interest related to lower average outstanding capitalized lease obligations in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax provision no income tax benefit on losses for fiscal will be recorded until the company can establish with a reasonable degree of certainty the potential utilization of certain tax loss carry forwards from prior year store closing charges 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was and was impacted by the non deductible amortization and write off of goodwill and the reserves recorded to offset the deferred tax assets 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  write off of long lived assets and store closing charge 
during fiscal  weak trends in the retail industry combined with increasing competition lowered the operating results of the company 
while operating results in the first three quarters of the year were behind plan  management focused on strategies to achieve its plan during the important fourth quarter season 
during the fourth quarter  management reviewed its expectations for near and long term performance of the company  revised its earnings projections and reassessed the recoverability of the company s long lived assets 
as explained in note n to the financial statements  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
this financial accounting standard requires the company to perform an analysis of the recoverability of the net book value of long lived assets 
the company analyzed cash flows on an individual store basis to assess recoverability of store level long lived assets including allocated goodwill 
as a result of this analysis  impairment totaling  on a pre tax basis was indicated at certain stores 
the company also analyzed the value of its remaining goodwill and favorable leasehold interests not impaired under the store level sfas analysis using its historical method under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and determined that such remaining amounts also were impaired 
the apb analysis projected a fifteen year forecast period and produced  of aggregate undiscounted adjusted net income  including projected adjusted net losses for fiscal of  which included interest expense of  paid in cash and interest payable in kind pik of  and for fiscal of  which included cash interest expense of  and pik interest of  for fiscal  the company projected adjusted net income of approximately  which included cash interest expense of approximately  and pik interest of  due to the uncertainty of projections beyond  this level of adjusted net income was assumed to continue for each of the remaining fiscal years in the projection period 
accordingly  a non cash pre tax charge totaling  was recorded as indicated in note n to the financial statements 
also  management s fourth quarter review of individual stores operations and cash flows resulted in the identification of forty unprofitable or competitive market stores which did not fit the company s niche market strategy 
consequently  a pre tax charge totaling  was recorded at january  to cover the costs necessary to close these stores as indicated in note o to the financial statements 
sales for fiscal increased  or compared to fiscal comparable store sales decreased  or 
excluding the forty stores closed as of the end of fiscal  comparable store sales increased by 
during fiscal the company opened ten new prototype stores of which seven were located in new markets and three were relocations 
the company also closed ten stores excluding the stores identified to be closed as discussed above  resulting in a net increase in selling area of approximately  square feet 
the openings and closings of stores over the last two fiscal years has resulted in a net increase in sales of  the modest overall sales increases were affected by weak consumer demand which was generally experienced throughout the retail industry 
management believes that the company s geographical niche market positioning combined with its ability to distribute quality merchandise on a more timely basis tempered these generally weak retail trends 
the company experienced substantial sales increases in several merchandise categories  the most dramatic of which were in the housewares  prescriptions  junior apparel and bath and floor areas 
substantial sales gains also were generated in paper  cleaning and seasonal categories 
the company experienced sales declines in several softlines categories  primarily women s apparel 
the initial operating results of the seven new prototype stores and three relocated prototype stores opened during fiscal exceeded the company s original sales projections and reflected the success of the company s niche market positioning and merchandising strategies 
at fiscal year end  twenty seven new format stores were in operation  representing of all stores and of total company selling square feet 
gross profit increased or in fiscal compared to fiscal and  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decline in gross profit percent in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable primarily to the increased markdown activity which was necessary to counter sluggish customer demand during most of the year and to meet customers pricing expectations during this difficult period for the retail industry 
markdown expense increased by over such expense in fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced margin dollar increases due to higher sales in several merchandise categories  most notably stationery  prescriptions  bath and floor and seasonal 
while the company experienced margin dollar decreases in several softlines categories  they were concentrated primarily in the women s apparel and fashion areas 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or from fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal approximately of the total gross increase in selling  general and administrative expense was attributable to increases in corporate general administrative costs 
payroll and fringe benefits costs increased by approximately due to the effect of a full year s salary for the merchandising  real estate and other corporate personnel added in fiscal as well as the costs related to information systems personnel added during fiscal to support the new systems implementations to enhance efficiencies in warehouse  distribution and merchandising 
in addition  professional fees increased approximately due primarily to information systems and strategic planning consulting costs as well as increases in legal fees related to new store construction and financing 
in addition to the corporate general and administrative cost changes  advertising expenses as a percent of sales increased from to due to increases in the costs of paper and postage 
this accounted for approximately of the gross increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
store controllable expenses increased by  which also accounted for approximately of the gross increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
the change in store controllable expense was due primarily to increases in the costs of security equipment rentals  charge card processing fees due to increased credit card sales volume  utilities and inventory counting as a result of changes in procedures to allow for detailed sku level counts 
store controllable costs were partially reduced by decreases in supplies  travel and entertainment costs 
store fixed costs as a percent of sales increased from to due primarily to increases in rent expense 
these increases in selling  general and administrative expense were offset in part by an increase in other income resulting primarily from the sale of idle transportation assets 
interest expense increased  or for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense for fiscal was attributable primarily to higher usage of the revolving line of credit in fiscal and to the outstanding promissory notes of the company which require quarterly compounding interest payments to be paid in kind 
the company also had higher average outstanding capitalized lease obligations in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax provision the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted by the non deductible amortization and write off of goodwill and the reserve recorded to offset the deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate was higher than the normal statutory rates primarily as a result of non deductible goodwill amortization 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is seasonal with first quarter sales february through april being lower than sales during the other three quarters  while fourth quarter sales november through january have represented approximately of the full year s retail sales in recent years and normally involve a greater proportion of higher margin sales 
the company has satisfied its seasonal liquidity requirements primarily through a combination of funds provided from operations and from a revolving credit facility 
funds used by operating activities totaled  in fiscal  and funds provided from operations totaled  in fiscal and  in fiscal the change in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of planned net increases in inventory and other operating assets and decreases in accounts payable and other operating liabilities 
these decreases in cash flow were offset in part by changes in deferred income taxes 
the positive change in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of net decreases in inventory and accounts payable 
these increases in cash flow were offset in part by current and deferred tax payable changes  principally as a result of the store closing charge  the changes in profitability of the continuing operations and changes in other operating assets and liabilities 
effective march   the term of pamida  inc s pamida committed loan and security agreement the agreement was extended to march and the maximum borrowing limit of the facility was increased to  from  which had been the limit throughout fiscal prior to march   borrowings under the agreement bore interest at a rate which was per annum greater than the applicable prime rate 
effective march   borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate which is tied to the applicable prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor  generally at pamida s discretion 
the amounts pamida is permitted to borrow are determined by a formula based upon the amount of pamida s eligible inventory from time to time 
such borrowings are secured by security interests in all of the current assets including inventory of pamida and by liens on certain real estate interests and other property of pamida 
the company and two subsidiaries of pamida have guaranteed the payment and performance of pamida s obligations under the loan and security agreement and have pledged some or all of their respective assets  including the stock of pamida owned by the company  to secure such guarantees 
the agreement contains provisions imposing operating and financial restrictions on the company 
certain provisions of the agreement require the maintenance of specified amounts of tangible net worth as defined and working capital as defined and the achievement of specified minimum amounts of cash flow as defined 
other restrictions in the agreement and those provided under the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes will affect  among other things  the ability of pamida to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repay indebtedness prior to its stated maturity  create liens  enter into leases  sell assets or engage in mergers or acquisitions  make capital expenditures and make investments 
these covenants currently have not had an impact on the company s ability to fully utilize the revolving credit facility 
however  certain of the covenants  such as those which restrict the ability of the company to incur indebtedness or encumber its property or which impose restrictions on or otherwise limit the company s ability to engage in sale leaseback transactions  may at some future time prevent the company from pursuing its store expansion program at the rate that the company desires 
obligations under the agreement were  at february  and  at january  as noted above  this facility expires in march  and the company intends to refinance any outstanding balance by such date 
borrowings under the agreement are senior to the senior subordinated notes of the company 
the company had long term debt and obligations under capital leases of  at february  and  at january  the company s ability to satisfy scheduled principal and interest payments under such obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent primarily upon the sufficiency of the company s operating cash flow 
at february   the company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its various financing agreements 
on december   the promissory notes of the company were amended effective as of december  to provide that  until the obligations of pamida and the company under certain of pamida s credit agreements have been repaid  the quarterly interest payments on the promissory notes of the company will be paid in kind 
pamida paid the company in fiscal under a tax sharing agreement to enable the company to pay quarterly dividends to its preferred stockholders 
during fiscal  the company received from pamida under a tax sharing agreement as a reimbursement for certain tax benefits derived by pamida 
such remittance  along with from the exercise of certain stock options  was used by the company to redeem subordinated promissory notes as described in note l to the financial statements  to repay intercompany balances totaling  and to pay quarterly dividends on preferred stock 
since the company conducts no operations of its own  the only cash requirement of the company relates to preferred stock dividends in the aggregate annual amount of approximately  and pamida is expressly permitted under its existing credit facilities to pay dividends to the company to fund such preferred stock dividends 
however  the general corporation law of the state of delaware  under which the company and pamida are incorporated  allows a corporation to declare or pay a dividend only from its surplus or from the current or the prior year s earnings 
due to the accumulated deficit resulting primarily from the store closings and the write off of goodwill and other long lived assets recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company and pamida did not declare or pay any cash dividends in fiscal and may pay cash dividends in ensuing years only to the extent that the company and pamida satisfy the applicable statutory standards which include the company s having a net worth equal to at least the aggregate par value of the preferred stock which amounts to the cumulative dividend rate on the preferred stock increases by per quarter with a maximum aggregate increase of on each quarterly dividend payment date on which the preferred stock dividends are not paid currently on a cumulative basis 
any unpaid dividends are added to the liquidation value until paid in cash 
such nonpayment of preferred stock dividends does not accelerate the redemption rights of the preferred stockholders 
the company made capital expenditures of  in fiscal compared to  during fiscal the company plans to open three new stores in fiscal and will consider additional opportunities for new store locations as they arise 
total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  in fiscal the company expects to fund these expenditures from cash flow from its operations 
the costs of buildings and land for new store locations are expected to be financed by operating or capital leases with unaffiliated landlords 
the company s expansion program also will require inventory of approximately  to  for each new market store  which the company expects to finance through trade credit  borrowings under the agreement and cash flow from operations 
the recent changes to the agreement  along with expected improvements in the company s cash flow from operations  should provide adequate resources to meet the company s near term liquidity requirements 
on a long term basis  the company s expansion will require continued investments in store locations  working capital and distribution and infrastructure enhancements 
the company expects to continue to finance some of these investments through leases from unaffiliated landlords  trade credit  borrowings under the agreement and cash flow from operations but ultimately will need to explore additional sources of funds which may include capital structure changes 
currently  it is not possible for the company to predict with any certainty either the timing or the availability of such additional financing 
inflation the company uses the lifo method of inventory valuation in its financial statements  as a result  the cost of merchandise sold approximates current costs 
the company s rental expense is generally fixed and  except for small amounts of percentage rents and rentals adjusted by cost of living increases tied to the consumer price index or interest rates  has not been affected by inflation
