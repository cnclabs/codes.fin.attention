item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the principal factors affecting the results of operations and the significant changes in balance sheet items of smc on a consolidated basis for the periods listed as well as smc s liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the smc consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
introduction smc acquired first international on july   standard management international on december   dixie national life on october  and shelby life on november  these acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting effective june  for the first international acquisition  december  for the standard management international acquisition  october  for the dixie national life acquisition and november  for the shelby life acquisition 
therefore  these subsidiaries are included in the smc consolidated financial statements commencing with their respective acquisition effective dates 
smc acquired a block of insurance liabilities and assets from the midwest life insurance company in liquidation the midwest block effective june   and it is included in the smc consolidated financial statements commencing with that date 
smc disposed of first international on march  effective march  and terminated the operations of standard reinsurance on march  product profitability 
margins on life insurance and annuity products are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
rising interest rates would result in a decline in the market value of assets 
however  as there are positive cash flows from renewal premiums  investment income and maturities of existing assets  the need for early disposition of investment assets to meet operating cash flow requirements would be unlikely 
rising interest rates would also result in available cash flows from maturities being invested at higher interest rates  which would help support a gradual increase in new business and renewal interest rates on interest sensitive products 
a sharp  sudden rise in the interest rate environment without a concurrent increase in crediting rates could result in higher surrenders  particularly for annuities 
the effect of surrenders would be to reduce earnings over the long term but to increase or decrease earnings in the period of the surrender to the extent surrender charges were applicable and differed from the write off of related deferred acquisition costs or present value of future profits 
when interest rates fall  smc generally attempts to adjust the credited interest rates subject to competitive pressures 
although smc believes that such strategies will continue to permit it to achieve a positive spread  a significant decline in the yield on smc s investments could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of smc 
purchased insurance business 
in accordance with industry practice  when smc purchased first international  the midwest block  dixie national life and shelby life  and recaptured a block of insurance from national mutual on july   effective as of may  the national mutual block  it assigned a portion of the purchase price  called the present value of future profits  to the right to receive future cash flows arising from existing insurance policies 
this asset was recorded when the business was purchased at the value of projected future cash flows on existing policies  less a discount to present value 
as future cash flows emerge  they are treated as a recovery of this asset 
therefore  if cash flows emerging from the purchased or recaptured business during a period exactly equal the projections  they are offset by that period s amortization of the cost of the policies purchased 
in that event  the only income statement effect from the purchased business is the realization of the discount that was initially deducted from the asset to reflect its present value 
changes in the future annual amortization of this asset are not expected to have a significant effect on the results of operations  because the amount of amortization is expected to be equal to the profits emerging from the purchased policies  net of interest on the unrecovered present value of future profits balance 
this asset is amortized over the expected life of the related policies purchased 
present value of future profits is increased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment gains 
in selecting the interest rate to calculate the discounted present value of the projected future profits  smc used the risk rate of return it needs to earn in order to invest in the business being acquired or recaptured 
in determining this required rate of return  we consider the following factors the magnitude of the risks associated with each of the actuarial assumptions used in determining expected future cash flows as described above 
our cost of the capital required to fund the acquisition or recapture 
the likelihood of changes in projected future cash flows that might occur if there are changes in insurance regulations and tax laws 
the acquired company s compatibility with other smc activities that may favorably affect future cash flows 
the complexity of the acquired company or recaptured business 
recent prices ie  discount rates used in determining valuations paid by others to acquire or recapture similar blocks of business 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected future profits is used to determine the subsequent amortization of the cost of the purchased policies for acquisitions prior to november  for acquisitions subsequent to november   the discount rate used to amortize the unamortized balance of the present value of future profits is the crediting rate of the underlying policies 
the discount rate selected may affect subsequent earnings in those instances where the purchase price of the policies exceeds the value of net assets acquired including the value of future profits discounted at the selected interest rate 
selection of a lower or higher discount rate will increase or decrease the portion of the purchase price assigned to the present value of future cash flows and will result in an offsetting decrease or increase in the amount of the purchase price assigned to goodwill 
the effect on subsequent earnings caused by this variation in purchase price allocation will depend on the characteristics of the policies purchased 
for products where the profits emerge at relatively constant levels over an extended period of time for example  most of smc s immediate and deferred annuities  use of a lower rate may result in an increase in reported earnings in the early years after an acquisition followed by a decrease in earnings in later years 
for products where profits emerge over a shorter period of time or in amounts that decrease over the life of the product for example  ordinary and term life products  selection of a lower rate will generally result in a decrease in reported earnings in the early years after an acquisition followed by an increase in reported earnings in later years 
for smc  the majority of the cost of policies purchased relates to ordinary life products and the balance to deferred annuity products 
the activity related to the present value of future profits of the business acquired for smc is summarized as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year    additions during the year from acquisitions and recaptures   deletions during the year from disposal of subsidiaries net amortization during the year  adjustments relating to net unrealized gains loss on fixed maturities available for sale balance at end of year    the percentage of future expected net amortization of the present value of future profits before the effect of net unrealized gains and losses  based on the present value of future profits at december  and current assumptions as to future events on all policies in force  will be between and in each of the years through the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future profits for business acquired prior to november   reflected in smc s december  consolidated balance sheet ranged from to 
smc used a discount rate to calculate the present value of future profits on the business of the dixie national life  shelby life and national mutual acquisitions and recaptures 
acquisition of blocks of business 
smc s growth strategy includes the acquisition of in force blocks of business through assumption reinsurance agreements 
the accounting recognition given these acquisitions is dependent upon the type of business acquired 
fpdas and payout annuities are recorded at full account value 
funds received are recorded as invested assets 
the excess of the liabilities assumed over assets received is recorded as the present value of future profits and amortized in relation to expected gross profits 
produced insurance business 
insurance products generate two types of profit streams i from the excess of investment income earned over that credited to the policyholder and ii from the excess of premiums received over costs incurred for policy issuance  administration and mortality 
costs incurred in issuing new policies are deferred and recorded as deferred acquisition costs dac  which are amortized using present value techniques so that profits are realized in proportion to premium revenue for certain products and estimated gross profits for certain other products 
profits from all of these elements are recognized over the lives of the policies  no profits are recorded at the time the policies are issued 
amortization of dac was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from increased amortization of dac as gross profits from business sold in recent years began to emerge 
dac of  at december  and additions to policy acquisition costs of  for business produced during the year ended december  are generally being amortized over the expected lives of the policies  a period of approximately years  in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
interest is being accreted at during year and thereafter  the projected crediting rate on the policies 
dac is increased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment gains 
the offset to these amounts is recorded directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes 
future expected amortization of dac for the next five years before the effect of net realized and unrealized gains and losses  based on dac at december  and current assumptions  is as follows dollars in thousands gross amortization      interest accreted net amortization      the amounts included in the foregoing table do not include any amortization of dac resulting from the sale of new products after december  any changes in future annual amortization of this asset are not expected to have a significant effect on results of operations because the amount of amortization is expected to be proportionate to the profits from the produced policies  net of interest on dac 
variances between actual and expected profits 
actual experience on purchased and produced insurance may vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums collected  investment spreads  mortality costs  surrender benefits  persistency  administrative costs and other factors 
variances from original projections  whether positive or negative  are included in net income as they occur 
to the extent that these variances indicate that future experience will differ from the estimated profits reflected in the capitalization and amortization of the cost of policies purchased or the cost of policies produced  current and future amortization rates may be adjusted 
accounting for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life products 
the company primarily accounts for its annuity and universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
under sfas no 
 a benefit reserve is established at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received 
thereafter  the benefit reserve is adjusted for any additional deposits  interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals 
revenues for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life policies  other than certain non interest sensitive annuities  consist of policy charges for surrenders and partial withdrawals  mortality and administration  and investment income earned 
such revenues do not include the annuity and universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits 
expenses related to these products include interest credited to policyowner account balances  operating costs for policy administration  amortization of dac and mortality costs in excess of account balances 
costs relating to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses  approximately of initial annuity premium deposits and of premiums from universal and interest sensitive life products for smc  are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas no 
 dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
unit linked product accounting 
separate account assets and liabilities are maintained primarily for contracts of which the majority represents unit linked products where benefits on surrender and maturity are not guaranteed 
they generally represent funds held in accounts to meet specific investment objectives of policyholders who bear the investment risk 
investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to such policyholders 
smc earns income from the investment management fee it charges on such unit linked contracts  which range from 
to of the value of the underlying separate accounts 
discussion of changes in the consolidated statement of operations from year ended december  to year ended december  operating income 
the income from operations before net realized investment gains  gain on disposal of subsidiaries and reduction in accruals of certain legal expenses was  in  or 
per share  compared to  for  or 
per share 
the change resulted primarily from international operations producing income from operations of  compared to a loss of  for and  respectively 
the international operating gains resulted primarily from increased management fees on an increasing separate account base due to portfolio sales in and  and increased value of assets under management  coupled with a decrease in marketing costs in when compared to the income from operations in the united states decreased to  in compared to  in the decline was attributable to an increase in interest expense from borrowings to repurchase common stock  class s preferred stock and the purchase of shelby life and additional costs to convert the operations and expand the marketing effort in dixie national life 
premium income 
premium income is composed of premiums  including renewal premiums  received on ordinary life insurance policies 
as noted above  smc s new product sales are composed primarily of annuity products 
under gaap  deposits from interest sensitive annuities and other financial products are not recorded as revenues 
gaap premium income for the was  an increase of  or from  for this increase is mainly attributable to recapture of premiums ceded of  due to the termination and recapture of a reinsurance agreement with national mutual and the inclusion of dixie national life and shelby life in the results of operations for periods after october  and november   respectively 
these amounts offset the decline in premiums from the cession of a portion of first international s life insurance business and the regular policy lapses  surrenders and expiries in smc s closed blocks of business 
net premiums received from the sales of interest sensitive annuities and other financial products which are not recorded as revenues were  compared to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in premium deposits is partially due to an increase in gross domestic premium deposits 
gross domestic premium deposits received from interest sensitive annuities and financial products were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is the result of an aggressive marketing campaign implemented by standard life with increased crediting interest rates 
also contributing to the increase in premiums is the continued development of smc s distribution system 
since smc s operating income is primarily a function of its investment spreads  mortality experience and operating expenses  a change in premium deposits in a single period does not directly cause operating income to change  although continued increases or decreases in premiums may affect the growth rate of total assets on which investment spreads are earned 
smc also decreased the quota share portion of business ceded pursuant to a reinsurance agreement from to at september   which was further decreased to effective april  premium deposits ceded pursuant to this reinsurance agreement reduced net premium deposits by  in the year ended december  compared to  in net investment income 
net investment income increased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the increase primarily resulted from an increase in total invested assets amortized cost of approximately from to  most of which occurred in the fourth quarter due to the acquisition of shelby life 
the average net yield on smc s invested assets was for both years ended december  and the continued growth in smc s total invested assets reflects increased sales of fpdas and the inclusion of dixie national life and shelby life in the results of operations effective october  and november   respectively  which was offset by the invested assets ceded in the giac reinsurance transaction 
net realized investment gains 
net realized investment gains increased  or to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase primarily resulted from active portfolio management by smc 
net realized investment gains fluctuate from period to period and arise when securities are sold in response to changes in the investment environment which provide opportunities to maximize return on the investment portfolio without adversely affecting the quality and overall yield of the investment portfolio 
gain on disposal of subsidiaries 
on march   smc completed the sale of a duplicate charter associated with first international to giac 
smc received sale proceeds of  including  for the charter and licenses associated with first international and  of reinsurance ceding commissions 
standard life realized a net pre tax gain of  on this sale 
in addition  first international  standard life and giac have entered into a series of reinsurance and other agreements that include provisions for standard life to administer first international policies in force at the date of sale 
in an unrelated matter  smc decided in february to terminate the reinsurance agreement between standard reinsurance and salamandra  and to not renew the barbados license of standard reinsurance 
this resulted in the write off of smc s investment in standard reinsurance and certain intangible assets of standard reinsurance amounting to  the combined effect of the pre tax gain on the sale of first international and related contracts  and the standard reinsurance write offs  was  pre tax and  after tax 
per share in the first quarter of policy charges 
policy charges  which represent the amounts assessed against policyholder account balances for the cost of insurance  policy administration and surrenders  increased  or to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in policy charges resulted from an increase in policy surrender charges on fpdas and the inclusion of dixie national life and shelby life in operating results for periods after october  and november   respectively  which offset the absence of policy charges from smc s closed blocks of universal life business which were sold to giac through a reinsurance contract effective january  amortization of excess of net assets acquired over acquisition cost 
amortization of excess of net assets acquired over acquisition cost negative goodwill is recorded to amortize into earnings the negative goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of standard management international in the negative goodwill is being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
amortization of negative goodwill was  for each of the years ended december  and management fees and similar income from separate accounts 
management fees and similar income from separate accounts consists of the investment management fees earned by standard management international on its separate account assets and investment contracts 
management fees and similar income from separate accounts increased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to an increase in the value of assets held in separate accounts from  at december  to  at december  and to fluctuations in service fees being levied on certain transactions 
net deposits from sales of unit linked products by standard management international were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
administration fee income 
administration fee income includes administration fees of  and other income related to reinsurance and administration agreements with giac and administration fees of  collected in connection with the terminated and recaptured reinsurance agreement with national mutual 
the administration fee income from national mutual primarily related to services provided in prior years  the income was not previously recorded due to uncertainty as to its collection 
the national mutual fee income will not recur in the future 
administration fee income was  for the year ended december   there was no such income for other income 
other income increased  or to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the increase resulted primarily from the reserve and experience refund adjustments in connection with the reinsurance agreements with giac and increased commissions received by standard marketing from the sale of unaffiliated products 
benefits and claims 
benefits and claims include life insurance and payout annuity benefits paid and changes in policy reserves 
benefits and claims increased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in reserves of  related to the termination and recapture of a reinsurance agreement with national mutual 
throughout smc s history  it has experienced both periods of higher and lower benefit claims 
such volatility is not uncommon in the life insurance industry and  over extended periods of time  periods of higher claims experience tend to be offset by periods of lower claims experience 
interest credited on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products 
interest credited on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or from  for the comparable prior year period 
the increase resulted primarily from smc s increase of credited interest rates on new annuity sales and the increases in the growth in policy reserves for fpdas from sales and the acquisition of shelby life 
at december   the weighted average interest credited rate for standard life s annuities and other financial product liabilities was compared to at december  salaries and wages 
salaries and wages were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or from  for the comparable prior year period 
this increase was caused primarily by an increase in the number and average wages of employees in the united states due to the acquisitions of dixie national life and shelby life and the increase in incentive compensation for the increase in income for the year ended december in the first quarter of  the chief financial officer gave notice he will be terminating his employment at smc as he has been named commissioner of the indiana department of insurance 
the company is currently discussing benefits that may or may not be due to the officer 
the amount of such benefits cannot be determined at this time 
amortization 
amortization expense includes charges to operations for the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  the present value of future profits  the excess of cost over net assets acquired and subsidiary organization costs 
amortization expense increased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs as gross profits from business sold in recent years began to emerge and increased surrenders and their corresponding increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  and from the amortization of present value of future profits for the acquisitions of dixie national life  shelby life and national mutual 
these items more than offset reduced amortization of excess of cost over net assets acquired and present value of future profits due to the sale of first international 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in other operating expenses resulted primarily from the expenses of dixie national life and shelby life included in the results for the periods after october  and november   respectively and the increased expenses related to potential acquisitions and advisory fees 
interest expense and financing costs 
interest expense and financing costs increased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense and financing costs during resulted primarily from the borrowing on an amended revolving line of credit agreement with a bank the amended credit agreement 
the borrowing under the amended credit agreement and the original credit agreement primarily occurred after december  in connection with the acquisition of shelby life and repurchase of common stock and class s preferred stock 
class action litigation and settlement costs 
class action litigation and settlement costs were recorded to reflect the estimated costs of litigation and settlement of the shareholder class action lawsuit  based on the terms of the settlement agreement and assumptions as to the future estimated legal and other costs to settle the lawsuit  which was settled in march  and to register the class s preferred stock which was distributed to the class participants in february there were no class action litigation and settlement expenses in the years ended december  and however  with the signing of the settlement agreement with the persons who previously excluded themselves from the class and the reevaluation of the future estimated legal and other costs to settle the lawsuit  smc recorded a reduction of  in the second quarter of in the estimated future costs to settle the lawsuit and register the class s preferred stock 
federal income taxes 
federal income tax expense credit was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the large credit in is primarily due to tax benefits of  related to the sale of first international 
also  the effective rates are less than the statutory rates primarily because the amortization of excess of net assets acquired over acquisition cost resulting from the acquisition of standard management international is not subject to united states income tax 
extraordinary gain on early redemption of redeemable preferred stock 
extraordinary gains are recorded on the early redemption of the class s preferred stock for the amount by which smc is able to repurchase the class s preferred stock below its book value 
smc will continue to repurchase these shares as long as holders of the class s preferred stock are willing to sell at a substantial discount to book value 
the extraordinary gain was  for the year ended december  compared to no gain for the prior comparable period 
discussion of changes in the consolidated statement of operations from year ended december  to year ended december  operating income 
the income from operations before net realized investment gains and class action litigation and settlement costs increased to  or 
per share from  or 
per share for and  respectively 
the increase resulted from us operations producing income from operations of  compared to a us loss from operations of  for and  respectively 
the us operating gains resulted primarily from increased interest spreads on an increasing asset base due to annuity sales in and the improvement in us operations was offset by a decline in international income from operations from  in to a loss of  in as the costs of resuming marketing were absorbed 
premium income 
gaap premium income for was  an increase of from  for increase in premium income resulted primarily from the inclusion of dixie national life in the results of operations effective october  net premiums received from the sales of interest sensitive annuities and other financial products which are not recorded as revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decline is partially due to increased competitive pressures 
to protect its profit margins  smc was not willing to match other insurers high interest crediting and commission rates which caused a decrease in gross domestic premium deposits of  in when compared to additionally  standard life began ceding a portion of its new annuity business to an unaffiliated reinsurer effective january  premium deposits ceded pursuant to the reinsurance agreement with the reinsurer reduced net premiums by  for there was no such reinsurance in net investment income 
net investment income increased to  in from  in this increase primarily resulted from growth in smc s total invested assets attributable to the increased sales of fpdas in and the inclusion of dixie national life in the results of operations effective october  the amortized cost of total invested assets increased to  in from  in these increased assets also benefited from a higher concentration of investments in fixed maturity securities 
the average annualized yield of smc s investment portfolio for the year ended december  increased to from for net realized investment gains 
net realized investment gains increased to  in from  in results reflect increased gains on sales of investments due to rising values of fixed maturity securities as interest rate levels decreased  combined with active portfolio management 
net realized gains fluctuate from period to period and arise when securities are sold in response to changes in the investment environment which provide opportunities to maximize return on the investment portfolio without adversely affecting the quality of the investment portfolio 
policy charges 
policy charges increased to  for compared to  for the increase in universal life policy charges resulted from increased surrender charges on interest sensitive annuity products and the inclusion of dixie national life in operating results for periods after october  amortization of excess of net assets acquired over acquisition cost 
amortization of negative goodwill increased to  for compared to  for due to a reallocation of the purchase price in the fourth quarter of which increased negative goodwill 
management fees and similar income from separate accounts 
management fees and similar income from separate accounts decreased to  in from  in this decrease is due to a change in the mix of the types of separate accounts whereby those earning higher investment management fees represent a significantly smaller portion of the total in than in most of the new policies sold in carried significantly smaller investment management fees than the policies lapsed or surrendered in net deposits from sales of unit linked products by standard management international were  in and  in other income 
other income includes primarily override commissions received by standard marketing from unaffiliated companies and other income recorded by standard management international 
other income increased to  for from  in the increase primarily resulted from commissions from the sale of unaffiliated products and to a lesser extent the inclusion of dixie national life in the results of operations after october  these increases more than offset any loss of fee income generated by standard advertising which was sold in early benefits and claims 
benefits and claims increased to  for from  for the increase in benefits and claims resulted primarily from an increase in death benefits in when compared to the favorable mortality experience in mortality experience is volatile and these trends are not predictable from period to period 
interest credited on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products 
interest credited on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products was  for  an increase of  or from  for the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from increases in interest credited from the growth in policy reserves for fpdas 
this more than offsets any decreases from the decline in credited interest rates on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products 
at december   the weighted average interest credited rate for standard life s interest sensitive annuities and other financial product liabilities was compared to at december  salaries and wages 
salaries and wages were  for  an increase of from  for the prior year 
this increase was caused by  of unusual charges due to the termination of certain international marketing programs and the subsequent reduction of smc s staff in luxembourg in  the capitalization of certain salaries of  associated with the internal development of computer software in  increased salaries for new marketing efforts for standard management international in and the inclusion of dixie national life in the results of operations for periods after october  additionally  the average wages per employee increased in amortization 
amortization expense for was  an increase of  or  from  for the prior year 
the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs as gross profits from business sold in recent years began to emerge and from the amortization of present value of future profits for the acquisition of dixie national life  which more than offset reduced amortization of present value of future profits on previous acquisitions as persistency of the purchased business begins to improve 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  were  reflecting a decrease of  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in other operating expenses resulted primarily from decreases in consulting  legal and other expenses related to potential acquisitions and the sale of standard advertising in early  which more than offset the increased expenses of operating dixie national life from october  to december  interest expense and financing costs 
interest expense and financing costs increased to  in from  in the increase in interest expense during resulted primarily from the payments on the capital lease obligations 
class action litigation and settlement costs 
smc recorded a reduction of  in in the estimated future costs to settle the lawsuit and list the class s preferred stock 
federal income taxes 
federal income tax expense was  for  compared to a credit of  for the effective rate of is less than the statutory rate of primarily because the amortization of excess of net assets acquired over acquisition cost resulting from the acquisition of standard management international is not subject to united states income tax 
smc receives the benefits of a special deduction available to small life insurance companies and the utilization of capital and operating loss carry forwards in the life insurance subsidiaries 
however  the losses incurred by standard management and the foreign subsidiaries  primarily due to class action litigation and settlement costs  and operating costs in excess of management fees  provide no current tax benefit as standard management and the foreign subsidiaries are in a net operating loss carryforward position 
the benefits of the special deduction available to small life insurance companies will no longer be available when consolidated assets exceed  liquidity and capital resources standard management is an insurance holding company 
the liquidity requirements of standard management are met primarily from management fees  equipment rental fees and payments for other charges and dividends and interest on surplus debentures received from standard management s subsidiaries as well as standard management working capital 
these are standard management s primary source of funds to pay operating expenses and meet debt service obligations 
the payment of dividends and interest on surplus debentures and management and other fees by standard life to standard management is subject to restrictions under the insurance laws of indiana  standard life s jurisdiction of domicile 
these internal sources of liquidity have been supplemented in the past by external sources such as lines of credit and revolving credit agreements and long term debt and equity financing in the capital markets 
smc reported on a consolidated gaap basis net cash provided by operations of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although deposits received on smc s interest sensitive annuities and other financial products are not included in cash flow from operations under gaap  such funds are available for use by smc 
cash provided by operations plus net deposits received  less net account balances returned to policyholders on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products  resulted in positive cash flow of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash generated on a consolidated basis is available to the parent company only to the extent that it is generated at the parent company level or is available to the parent company through dividends  management fees or other payments from subsidiaries 
in april  standard management instituted a program to repurchase smc common stock from time to time 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to enhance shareholder value 
standard management had repurchased  shares of smc common stock for  as of december  the repurchases in have been paid for through additional borrowing under the amended credit agreement 
at december   standard management was authorized to purchase an additional  shares under this program 
standard management implemented a policy to issue shares for the exercise of stock options from treasury stock 
standard management has reissued  shares in under this program at a cost of  in february  standard management instituted a program to repurchase from time to time up to  shares of its class s preferred stock in the open market or privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   standard management had repurchased and retired  shares of its class s preferred stock for  at december   standard management had parent company only cash and short term investments of  these funds are available to standard management for general corporate purposes 
standard management s parent company only operating expenses not including class action litigation and settlement costs and interest expense were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
pursuant to the management services agreement with standard management  standard life paid standard management a monthly fee of  during and for certain management services related to the production of business  investment of assets and evaluation of acquisitions 
management service agreements between standard life and dixie national life have been approved by the mississippi department of insurance which currently requires a monthly payment of  from dixie national life to standard life 
both of these agreements provide that they may be modified or terminated by the department of insurance in the event of financial hardship of standard life or dixie national life 
the management service agreement between standard management and standard life for has been renegotiated to increase the monthly fee to  annual fee of  in this amended management service agreement has been approved by the commissioner of the indiana department of insurance 
pursuant to the management services agreement with standard management  premier life luxembourg paid standard management a management fee of  per quarter during and for certain management and administrative services 
the agreement provides that it may be modified or terminated by either standard management or premier life luxembourg 
standard management does not plan to modify this agreement in at april   standard management sold its property and equipment to an unaffiliated leasing financing company for  and subsequently entered into a capital lease obligation whereby standard management pays a monthly rental amount of  standard management charges a monthly equipment rental fee to its subsidiaries of  for this equipment and additional equipment purchased after april  on november   standard life acquired through merger shelby life from dlac for approximately  including  in cash   shares of restricted smc common stock valued at  and  of acquisition costs 
financing for the shelby life transaction was provided by senior debt of  under the amended credit agreement and  in subordinated convertible debt described below 
the amended credit agreement permits standard management to borrow up to  in the form of a seven year reducing revolving loan arrangement 
standard management has agreed to pay a non use fee of 
per annum on the unused portion of the commitment 
in connection with the original and amended credit agreement  standard management issued warrants to the bank to purchase  shares of smc common stock 
borrowing under the amended credit agreement may be used for contributions to surplus of insurance subsidiaries  acquisition financing  and repurchases of class s preferred and smc common stock 
the debt is secured by a pledge agreement of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of standard life and standard marketing 
interest on the borrowing under the amended credit agreement is determined  at the option of standard management  to be i a fluctuating rate of interest to the corporate base rate announced by the bank from time to time plus per annum  or ii a rate at libor plus 
annual principal repayments of  begin in november and conclude in november indebtedness incurred under the amended credit agreement is subject to certain restrictions and covenants including  among other things  certain minimum financial ratios  minimum statutory surplus requirements for the insurance subsidiaries  minimum consolidated equity requirements for standard management and certain investment and indebtedness limitations

smc anticipates increasing the amended credit agreement to  to finance the acquisition of savers life 
in connection with the acquisition of shelby life  standard management borrowed  from an insurance company pursuant to a subordinated convertible debt agreement which is due in december  and requires interest payments in cash at per annum  or  if standard management chooses  in non cash additional subordinated convertible debt notes at per annum until december  the subordinated convertible notes are convertible into smc common stock at the rate of per share through november  and per share thereafter 
standard management may prepay the subordinated convertible debt with not less than thirty days notice at any time 
the subordinated convertible debt agreement contains terms and financial covenants substantially similar to those in the amended credit agreement 
assuming the continuation of current level of debt under the amended credit agreement  and current interest rates at december  weighted average rate of and assuming standard management elects the non cash interest payment option under the subordinated convertible debt  annual debt service in would be approximately  in interest paid on the amended credit agreement 
in addition  standard management has obligations under a capital lease of  from the funds borrowed by standard management pursuant to the amended credit agreement and the subordinated convertible debt agreement   was loaned to standard life pursuant to an unsecured surplus debenture agreement surplus debenture which requires standard life to make quarterly interest payments to standard management at a variable corporate base rate plus per annum  and annual principal payments of  per year beginning in and concluding in the interest and principal payments are subject to quarterly approval by the indiana department of insurance  depending upon satisfaction of certain financial tests relating to levels of standard life s capital and surplus and general approval of the commissioner of the indiana department of insurance 
standard management currently anticipates these quarterly approvals will be granted 
assuming the approvals are granted and the december  interest rate of continues in  standard management will receive interest income of  from the surplus debenture for dividends from standard life to standard management are limited by laws applicable to insurance companies 
as an indiana domiciled insurance company  standard life may pay a dividend or distribution from its surplus profits  without the prior approval of the indiana commissioner of insurance  if the dividend or distribution  together with all other dividends and distributions paid within the preceding twelve months  does not exceed the greater of i net gain from operations or ii of surplus  in each case as shown in its preceding annual statutory financial statements 
also  regulatory approval is required when dividends to be paid exceed unassigned surplus 
for the year ended december   standard life reported statutory net gain from operations of  statutory surplus of  and unassigned surplus of  standard life anticipates paying dividends of approximately  in and the approval of the indiana commissioner of insurance may be required 
standard life has declared a dividend of  to be paid in april standard management anticipates the available cash from its existing working capital  plus anticipated dividends  management fees  rental income and interest payments on its surplus debentures receivable will be more than adequate to meet its anticipated parent company only cash requirements for standard management has a note receivable of  from an affiliate and a note payable of  to a different affiliate 
this note receivable and note payable are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
us insurance operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of standard life are its contractual obligations to policyholders  dividend  rent and management fee payments to standard management and other operating expenses 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from premium income  net investment income  investment sales and maturities and sales of fpdas 
these sources of liquidity for standard life significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits and policy withdrawals and surrenders 
the amount of withdrawals and surrenders is affected by a variety of factors such as renewal interest crediting rates  interest rates for competing products  general economic conditions  standard life s am best ratings currently rated b and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
the policies and annuities issued by standard life contain provisions that allow policyholders to withdraw or surrender their policies under defined circumstances 
these policies and annuities generally contain provisions which apply penalties or otherwise restrict the ability of policyholders to make such withdrawals or surrenders 
standard life closely monitors the surrender and policy loan activity of its insurance products and manages the composition of its investment portfolios  including liquidity  in light of such activity 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and other withdrawals 
in addition to the potential effect on liquidity  unanticipated withdrawals in a changing interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if smc were required to sell investments at reduced values to meet liquidity demands 
smc manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings effect of changing market interest rates 
smc seeks assets that have duration characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
smc also prepares cash flow projections and performs cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
smc s us insurance subsidiaries currently expect available liquidity sources and future cash flows to be adequate to meet the demand for funds 
statutory surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the naic  as modified by the indiana department of insurance  or the state in which the insurance subsidiaries do business 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to reflect a more conservative perspective 
with respect to new business  statutory accounting practices require that i acquisition costs and ii reserves for future guaranteed principal payments and interest in excess of statutory rates  be expensed in the year the new business is written 
these items cause a statutory loss surplus strain from many insurance products in the year they are issued 
smc designs its products to minimize such first year losses  but certain products continue to cause a statutory loss in the year written 
for each product  smc controls the amount of net new premiums written to manage the effect of such statutory surplus strain 
smc s long term growth goals contemplate continued growth in its insurance businesses 
to achieve these growth goals  smc s us insurance subsidiaries will need to increase statutory surplus 
additional statutory surplus may be secured through various sources such as internally generated statutory earnings  equity sales  infusions by standard management with funds generated through debt or equity offerings or mergers with other life insurance companies 
if additional capital is not available from one or more of these sources  smc believes that it could reduce surplus strain through the use of reinsurance or through reduced issuance of new policies 
during  standard life produced a statutory net income of  as a result  standard management has not made cash capital contributions to standard life during to maintain adequate levels of statutory capital and surplus 
in march  standard life sold its subsidiary  first international  and realized an increase in statutory capital and surplus of approximately  from the statutory gain on the sale and related reinsurance transactions 
in order to be able to write volumes of business that it would not otherwise have been able to write due to regulatory restrictions based on the amount of its statutory capital and surplus commencing january   standard life began to reinsure a portion of its annuity business 
standard life s largest annuity reinsurer at december   winterthur  is rated a excellent by am best 
from january  to august  approximately of certain of standard life s annuity business produced was ceded 
standard life decreased the quota share portion of business ceded to at september  and further reduced it to effective april  to reflect the reduced need for additional capital and increase current earnings potential 
this reduction was possible since the surplus strain experienced by standard life was not as great as originally anticipated as a result of lower than expected sales in and the increase in surplus resulting from the sale of first international 
winterthur limits dividends and other transfers by standard life to standard management or affiliated companies in certain circumstances 
management believes that operational cash flow of standard life will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for as of december   standard life had statutory capital and surplus for regulatory purposes of  compared to  at december  as the life insurance and annuity business produced by standard life and dixie national life increases  standard life expects to continue to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements through statutory profits  through the continued reinsurance of a portion of its new business  and through additional capital contributions by standard management 
during  standard management did not make any capital contributions to standard life  other than the common stock associated with the shelby merger 
net cash flow from operations on a statutory basis of standard life  after payment of benefits and operating expenses  was  and  for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
if the need arises for cash which is not readily available  additional liquidity could be obtained from the sale of invested assets 
state insurance regulatory authorities impose minimum risk based capital requirements on insurance enterprises that were developed by the naic 
the formulas for determining the amount of rbc specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio the ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
enterprises below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specified corrective action 
each of smc s insurance subsidiaries has a ratio that is at least of the minimum rbc requirements  accordingly  the subsidiaries meet the rbc requirements 
standard life s acquisition of shelby life  and merger of shelby life into standard life  effective november  is anticipated to have a positive effect on standard life s liquidity and cash flows 
shelby life ceased writing new business effective november   thus reducing the statutory surplus strain normally associated with the issuance of new policies 
the anticipated profits from shelby life s book of business are expected to exceed the related interest expense connected with the  of surplus debentures issued by standard life in connection with the acquisition of shelby life 
the statutory net income of shelby life was  for the year ended december  and  for the ten months ended october  international operations 
the consolidated balance sheet of smc at december   includes a  credit representing the excess of net assets acquired over acquisition cost on the purchase of standard management international which will be amortized into future earnings 
this amortization is a non cash credit to smc statement of operations 
standard management international dividends are limited to its accumulated earnings without regulatory approval 
standard management international and premier life luxembourg were not permitted to pay dividends in and due to accumulated losses 
premier life bermuda did not pay dividends in and smc does not anticipate any dividends from these companies in due to the nature of unit linked products issued by standard management international  which represent over of the standard management international portfolio  the investment risk rests with the policyholder 
investment risk for standard management international exists where standard management international makes investment decisions with respect to the remaining traditional business and for the assets backing certain actuarial and regulatory reserves 
the investments underlying these liabilities mostly represent short term investments and fixed maturity securities 
these short term investments and fixed maturity securities are normally only bought and or disposed of on the advice of independent consulting actuaries who perform an annual analysis comparing anticipated cash flows on the insurance portfolio with the cash flows from the fixed maturity securities 
any resulting material mis matches are then covered by adjusting the securities in the investment portfolio as appropriate 
pending acquisition 
smc s pending purchase of savers life will cost approximately  of which approximately  is to be borrowed in cash under the amended credit agreement 
the balance of the purchase price will be paid in shares of common stock 
factors that may affect future results mergers  acquisitions and consolidations 
the us insurance industry has experienced an increasing number of mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of certain business lines 
these consolidations have been driven by a need to reduce costs of distribution and overhead and maintain business in force 
additionally  increased competition  regulatory capital requirements and technology costs have also contributed to the level of consolidation in the industry 
these forces are expected to continue as is the level of industry consolidation 
foreign currency risk 
standard management international policyholders invest in assets denominated in a wide range of currencies 
policyholders effectively bear the currency risk  if any  as these investments are matched by policyholder separate account liabilities 
therefore  their investment and currency risk is limited to premiums they have paid 
policyholders are not permitted to invest directly into options  futures and derivatives 
standard management international could be exposed to currency fluctuations if currencies within the conventional investment portfolio or certain actuarial reserves are mismatched 
the assets and liabilities of this portfolio and the reserves are continually matched by the company and at regular intervals by the independent actuary 
in addition  premier life luxembourg s shareholder s equity is denominated in luxembourg francs 
premier life luxembourg does not hedge it s translation risk because its stockholder s equity will remain in luxembourg francs for the foreseeable future and no significant realized foreign exchange gains or losses are anticipated 
at december   there was an unrealized gain from foreign currency translation adjustment of  uncertainties regarding intangible assets 
included in smc s financial statements as of december  are certain assets that are valued for financial statement purposes primarily on the basis of assumptions established by smc s management 
these assets include deferred acquisition costs  present value of future profits  costs in excess of net assets acquired and organization and deferred debt issuance costs 
the total value of these assets reflected in the december  consolidated balance sheet aggregated  or of smc s assets 
smc has established procedures to periodically review the assumptions utilized to value these assets and determine the need to make any adjustments in such values in smc s consolidated financial statements 
smc has determined that the assumptions utilized in the initial valuation of these assets are consistent with the current operations of smc as of december  regulatory environment 
currently  prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the naic is in the process of codifying sap to promote standardization of methods utilized throughout the industry
