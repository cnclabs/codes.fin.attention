as a result  the operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur in any future period 
results of operations net income for was million  or per share  on net sales of  million  compared to net income for of million  or per share  on net sales of  million 
net sales in were higher than primarily as a result of higher sales of pc systems  partially offset by lower revenues from the company s contract manufacturing operation 
the company s overall gross margin percentage increased from in to in primarily as a result of a increased sales of pc systems combined with a higher gross margin percentage realized on such sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired netframe for million in cash 
the acquisition adversely affected the company s net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal by million  or per share  which includes the operating losses of netframe since the july  acquisition date and a one time charge of million  or per share  for the write off of purchased in process research and development 
in february  the company adopted a plan to discontinue the manufacture and sale of zeos brand pc systems and to close the related manufacturing operations in minneapolis  minnesota 
as a result  the company recorded restructuring charge of million million  or per share  net of taxes in the restructuring charge included million related to the disposition of inventory of discontinued product lines  the write off of million of goodwill which resulted from the mei merger  million for other asset write downs  million related to personnel costs and million related to other exit costs 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
supersedes and simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share previously found in accounting principles board opinion no 
 earnings per share  and interpretations thereof  and makes them comparable to international earnings per share standards 
this statement is expected to be adopted by the company effective in its second quarter of fiscal the company does not expect earnings per share as calculated under sfas no 
to be materially different than calculated under the company s existing methodology 
net sales the following table summarizes the company s net sales by product line of of of amount sales amount sales amount sales pc systems    contract manufacturing    spectek memory products    total net sales    net sales for were higher than in  primarily due to an increase in sales of pc systems  partially offset by lower revenues from the company s contract manufacturing operation 
net sales for were higher than in  primarily due to a significant increase in sales of pc systems and higher revenues from the company s contract manufacturing operation  partially offset by lower sales from the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation 
personal computer systems 
net sales of pc systems were higher in compared to primarily due to a increase in unit sales partially offset by lower average selling prices for the company s pc systems 
the higher level of unit sales was largely attributable to significantly higher government sales and unit sales to large corporate entities 
although the company s overall unit sales grew by  the growth in unit sales to consumers and to small office home office soho customers more closely reflected the overall pc industry growth 
in addition  international sales were essentially flat from to the company s sales of pc systems also benefited from increased name recognition and market acceptance of the company s pc systems partially resulting from the receipt by the company of awards from trade publications recognizing the price and performance characteristics of micron brand pc systems and the company s service and support functions 
there can be no assurance that the company s name recognition and market acceptance of its pc products will not decline in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see certain factors personal computer systems competition in the pc industry 
sales to federal  state and local governmental entities increased as a percentage of total net sales of pc systems in to  compared to in and in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal benefited by strong demand from the company s governmental customers as well as sales pursuant to large government contacts 
as a result  government sales represented of total pc sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal the level of the company s governmental sales is partially dependent on the buying practices of governmental entities and the company s success in being selected to participate in government contracts in the future  of which there can be no assurance 
a significant decline in government sales of pc systems  including those sold pursuant to government contracts  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
sales to large and medium sized business were higher in compared to and represented of total pc sales in the growth in corporate sales was largely attributable to a more focused effort on behalf of the company s sales force directed toward corporate customers 
international sales of pc systems represented of total pc system sales in  compared to in and the company s international sales were adversely affected by a decrease in sales of its pc systems through distributors in japan as the company initiated direct sales of pc systems through its japanese call center 
sales from the company s japanese call center in represented of total pc system sales 
unit sales of notebook systems represented and of total pc system sales during and  respectively  compared to in demand for the company s notebook systems increased in response the company s broadening of its notebook product offering 
sales of pc systems incorporating intel pentium pro microprocessors and pentium microprocessors with mmx technology represented and  respectively  of total pc units sold in fiscal  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal sales of the company s pc systems incorporating intel pentium ii microprocessors  which were introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  represented of total pc units sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal see certain factors personal computer systems dependence on key sources of supply 
average selling prices for the company s pc systems were lower in compared to  primarily as a result of the introduction of a number of lower priced desktop and notebook models during the year combined with general price reductions for pc systems and to increased government sales of pc systems  which generally have lower average selling prices than the balance of the company s pc systems 
in addition  average selling prices in were adversely affected by a decline in the value of ram products incorporated in the company s pc systems  partially offset by an increase in average ram content per system to approximately megabytes 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company decided to discontinue the manufacture and sale of zeos brand pc systems and to close the related manufacturing operations in minneapolis  minnesota 
as a percentage of total pc system sales  sales of zeos brand pc systems represented in compared to in net sales of pc systems were significantly higher in compared to primarily due to significantly higher unit sales of pc systems and  to a lesser extent  higher average selling prices for such pc systems 
unit sales of pc systems in were higher compared to principally due to an increase in sales through the direct channel resulting from increased name recognition and market acceptance of the company s desktop pc systems and continued growth in the direct sales channel 
increased sales to governmental entities and increased sales of notebook systems also contributed to higher overall unit sales 
average selling prices for the company s pc systems increased in compared to primarily as a result of the completion of the transition in product mix toward relatively higher priced pentium and pentium pro microprocessor based systems and customer preferences for more richly configured pc systems with components featuring the latest developments in pc related technology 
in addition  during  the company experienced higher unit sales of notebook products  which generally have significantly higher average selling prices compared to the company s overall average selling price for pc systems 
contract manufacturing 
revenues from the company s contract manufacturing operation were lower in than in  primarily due to the effects of a sharp industry wide decline in pricing for semiconductor memory products and  to a lesser extent  a shift in product mix  which were partially offset by a higher level of demand for more complex products 
revenues from the company s contract manufacturing operation were higher in than in  however  quarterly revenues declined sequentially in from the second quarter through the fourth quarter 
the increase in revenue compared to was primarily due to the utilization of increased manufacturing capacity and a shift in mix of contract assembly services 
increased capacity was obtained through the acquisition and utilization of additional manufacturing equipment and the upgrade of existing manufacturing equipment 
contract manufacturing revenues in the last three quarters of fiscal were adversely impacted by the industry wide decline in pricing for semiconductor memory products 
the company continues to rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of its contract manufacturing business 
as a percent of total contract manufacturing revenue for  revenues from the company s top five contract manufacturing customers  including mti  were  compared to and in and  respectively 
revenues  directly or indirectly  from one customer represented of the revenues of the company s contract manufacturing operations in compared to revenues from the company s largest contract manufacturing customer in of 
contract manufacturing revenue from mti was  and of total contract manufacturing revenue in  and  respectively 
see certain factors contract manufacturing customer concentration 
spectek semiconductor memory products 
net sales of semiconductor memory products were slightly lower in compared to  despite a decline in average selling prices 
during  the company nearly tripled megabit shipments compared to net sales were lower in compared to  primarily due to a significant decline in sales of peripheral add on memory modules  a significant decline in average selling prices for the company s spectek semiconductor memory products and a generally lower grade of components received from mti  the company s primary supplier 
these effects were partially offset by an increase in megabits of memory products shipped in compared to the increase in megabits of memory products shipped in compared to and from compared to was primarily due to the acquisition and utilization of additional test and burn in equipment and reduced component test times  both resulting in increased throughput for substantially all memory products 
the company s spectek semiconductor memory products results of operations are influenced by a number of factors including pricing for  and availability of  nonstandard dram components 
see certain factors spectek semiconductor memory products operation 
historically  a substantial majority of the semiconductor components used in the spectek semiconductor memory products operation has been obtained from mti 
in  the company obtained of its components from mti  compared to in and in in fiscal  the spectek semiconductor memory products operation obtained nearly of its components from four sources 
purchases from alternative sources are generally negotiated on a purchase order basis 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to negotiate future purchases from alternative sources on terms acceptable to the company 
unless the company is able to continue obtaining significant quantities of nonstandard dram components from alternative sources  the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation could be limited by the volume of components supplied by mti 
any reduction in the availability or functionality of nonstandard semiconductor memory components from the company s suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations

gross margin of of of amount sales amount sales amount sales pc systems    contract manufacturing    spectek memory products    total gross margin    the company s overall gross margin increased million in compared to  primarily as a result of an increased gross margin percentage realized from the company s pc operation coupled with a higher level of pc sales and  to a lesser extent  an increase in gross margin realized from the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation 
gross margin increased in compared to primarily a result of a significant increase in the gross margin provided by the company s pc operation  partially offset by lower gross margins realized from the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation 
personal computer systems 
the company s gross margin on sales of pc systems increased million or in compared to principally due to the higher level of net sales of pc systems and a generally higher gross margin percentage realized on pc system sales 
the gross margin percentage for sales of the company s pc systems increased in compared to primarily as a result of improved component costs partially offset by lower selling prices for the company s pc systems 
there can be no assurance that the company s future cost of components will decrease at rates comparable to those in recent periods  or at all  or that the company s selling prices for its pc systems will not decrease at a rate faster than the decline in its component costs 
although gross margins increased in  they were adversely affected by intense price competition  an increase in the sales of  and a shift in product mix toward  the company s lower end pc systems 
the company continues to experience significant pressure on its gross margins as a result of intense competition in the pc industry and consumer expectations of more powerful pc systems at lower prices 
in addition  the company s gross margin percentage will continue to depend in large part on its ability to effectively manage its inventories of pc system components 
see certain factors personal computer systems competition in the pc industry and certain factors personal computer systems inventory management 
the gross margin amount provided by the company s pc operations in increased compared to principally due to the higher level of net sales of pc systems and a generally higher gross margin percentage realized on pc system sales 
gross margin as a percent of net sales of pc systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal benefited from an adjustment of million relating to revisions in estimates for certain contingencies for product and process technology costs 
the gross margin percentage for sales of the company s pc systems increased in compared to primarily as a result of improved component costs  particularly for ram products  and generally improved inventory management 
increased sales of the company s notebook products favorably affected the company s gross margin percentage for sales of pc systems in contract manufacturing 
the gross margin percentage realized from the company s contract manufacturing operation was higher in compared to primarily as a result of an increase in the overall complexity of the printed board assemblies produced by the company and an increase in revenues derived from services utilizing consigned inventory components 
the gross margin percentage decreased in compared to  due primarily to an increase in the percentage of total revenues derived from the company s turnkey memory module assembly services 
such assembly services generally have a lower gross margin percentage than the balance of the company s contract manufacturing services 
spectek semiconductor memory products 
the gross margin percentage realized by the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation was higher in compared to primarily due to lower costs of components  particularly those obtained from mti 
effective at the beginning of  the company modified its agreement for purchasing semiconductor memory components from mti 
under the prior agreement  the company s cost of components were generally equal to one half the price realized from sales of such components 
in  the company s costs of components were generally equal to one half of the net operating income generated from sales of such components 
see certain factors spectek semiconductor memory products operation dependence on component recovery agreement with mti 
the gross margin percentage realized by the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation declined significantly in compared to  primarily due to significantly lower average selling prices resulting from the sharp industry wide decline in market prices for semiconductor memory products and by the effect of increased purchases by the company of semiconductor memory components from third party suppliers 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  mti s improved semiconductor testing processes resulted in the shipment of a reduced amount of higher functional nonstandard semiconductor memory components to the company for recovery  thus reducing the company s average selling prices and gross margins for such products 
in the event that average selling prices for spectek s semiconductor memory products continue to decline  the gross margin for the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation would decline further and overall results of operations could be adversely affected 
see certain factors spectek semiconductor memory products operation pricing of dram products 
selling  general and administrative change change selling  general and administrative    as a of net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in absolute dollars and as a percent of net sales in compared to primarily due to higher levels of personnel costs and advertising associated with the expanded pc operations and higher technical and professional fees primarily associated with information technology consulting services 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company charged operations with a million accrual relating to revisions of estimates for selling costs associated with sales of pc systems 
in addition  sg a expenses in included million of goodwill amortization  reflecting charges prior to the write off of unamortized goodwill in connection with the company s restructuring charge in the second quarter of fiscal sg a expenses increased in absolute dollars  and as a percent of net sales  in compared to primarily due to higher levels of personnel costs associated with the expanded pc operations

the company s effective income tax rate was for liquidity and capital resources as of august   the company had cash and equivalents of million  representing an increase of million compared to august  principal sources of liquidity in were cash flows from operations of million  million from the issuance of common stock and borrowings of million 
principal uses of cash in were property  plant and equipment expenditures of million for expansion and capacity improvements of the company s manufacturing operations  million for the acquisition of netframe  net of cash acquired  the purchase of held to maturity investment securities of million and repayment of debt of million 
on october   the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission allowing for the issuance from time to time by the company of debt and or equity securities with a value of up to million  of which million has been issued 
the proceeds from any issuance may be used for general corporate purposes 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of million shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering 
net proceeds of million were received by the company 
in the public offering  mti sold million shares thereby reducing its ownership of the company as of august   to 
the registration statement also allows for an additional million of outstanding common stock of the company to be sold by certain existing shareholders  consisting of mti and certain management employees  of which million has been sold 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  cms  entered into a revolving loan agreement  expiring may  providing for borrowings of up to million 
amounts outstanding under the agreement are collateralized by certain real property 
under the terms of the agreement  the amount available to cms decreases by million per year 
as of august   there was million outstanding under the agreement 
the terms of the agreement limits dividends or other distributions from cms 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions which provides for borrowings of up to million  based on the company s tangible net worth 
the facility replaced two separate million credit facilities 
as of august   the company was eligible to borrow million under the facility  but had no borrowings outstanding 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  micron electronics japan kk  entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a financial institution  expiring june  providing for borrowings of up to billion japanese yen us million at august  
as of august   there was us million outstanding under the agreement 
at august  the company had commitments of million for capital expenditures for expansion and upgrade of facilities and equipment 
the company anticipates making capital expenditures in fiscal in excess of million 
the company is constructing an approximately  square foot facility in nampa  idaho 
this new facility is expected to provide space for the expansion of the company s nampa  idaho pc operation and will provide space for possible future expansion 
the company expects that its future working capital requirements will continue to increase 
the company believes that currently available cash and equivalents  cash flows from operations  the company s current credit facilities and equipment financings will be sufficient to fund its operations through fiscal however  maintaining an adequate level of working capital through the end of fiscal and thereafter will depend in large part on the success of the company s products in the marketplace and the company s ability to control inventory levels  component costs and other operating expenses 
the company may require additional financing for growth opportunities  including any internal expansion that the company may undertake  expansion and capacity enhancements to additional sites  or strategic acquisitions or partnerships 
there can be no assurance that any financings will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
certain factors in addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the historical results of the company s operations or those results or events contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
general fluctuations in operating results and stock price the company s past operating results have been  and its future operating results may be  subject to seasonality and other fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis  as a result of a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  industry competition  fluctuating market pricing for pcs and semiconductor memory products  fluctuating component costs  changes in product mix  inventory obsolescence  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  availability and pricing of the memory components used by the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation  the timing of orders from and shipments to oem customers  seasonal government purchasing cycles  manufacturing and production constraints  the effects of product reviews and industry awards  seasonal cycles common in the pc industry  critical component availability  and the failure by the company successfully integrate the operations of netframe 
as a result  the operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur in any future period 
the trading price of the common stock of the company is subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions and financial performance of other companies in the pc industry and mti  announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products or new strategies by competitors  component availability and pricing or other factors 
management historically  the company has experienced rapid revenue growth and an expansion in the number of its employees  in the breadth and complexity of its management  operating and financial information systems and in its geographic scope of operations 
this growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for the company s management and has placed  and continues to place  significant demands upon the company s management  operating and financial information systems  technical support systems and other resources 
the company continues to consider various expansion alternatives  including expansion of facilities  acquisition or establishment of facilities in new geographic regions and certain strategic relationships 
the company currently is expanding its pc operation facilities in nampa  idaho and has recently opened a pc sales and technical support call center in japan and a contract manufacturing operation in malaysia and recently acquired the operations of netframe 
there can be no assurance that the company s management resources  operating and financial information systems  technical support systems and other resources will be adequate to support the company s existing or future operations 
in addition  the company is in the process of identifying operating and application software challenges related to the year while the company expects to resolve year compliance issues substantially through normal replacement and upgrades of software  there can be no assurance that there will not be interruption of operations or other limitations of system functionality or that the company will not incur substantial costs to avoid such limitations 
any failure to effectively monitor  implement or improve the company s operational  financial  management and technical support systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
intellectual property matters it is common in the electronics industry for patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and pc manufacturers 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology used by the company may infringe on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company evaluates all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  seeks to obtain licenses for the continued use of such technology 
the company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement prior to the balance sheet date 
the company would be placed at a competitive disadvantage if it were unable to obtain such licenses upon terms at least as favorable as those experienced by the company s competitors 
the company has entered into several intellectual property license agreements  which generally require one time or periodic royalty payments and are subject to expiration at various times 
the company is unable to predict whether any of these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company or its suppliers are unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in their products or processes  the company may be forced to market products without certain technological features or software  discontinue sales of certain of its products and or defend legal actions taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology 
the inability of the company to obtain licenses necessary to use certain technology  or an inability to obtain such licenses on competitive terms  or any litigation determining that the company  in the manufacture or sale of its products  has infringed on the intellectual property rights of third parties could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company  as a majority owned subsidiary of mti  is licensed under certain license agreements between mti and third parties 
the company makes payments to mti relating to certain of such agreements 
the company s rights under such agreements may terminate in the event that the company is no longer a majority owned subsidiary of mti 
in the event of any such termination  the inability of the company independently to obtain such rights on similar terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
international operations during fiscal  of the company s net sales were attributable to sales outside the united states compared to for fiscal although the company s international sales in fiscal were adversely affected by a decrease in sales of its pc systems through distributors in japan as the company initiated direct sales of pc systems through its japanese call center established in  the company believes international sales as a percentage of total sales will increase in the future  particularly for pc systems and contract manufacturing services 
in marketing its pc systems in foreign countries  the company uses either direct selling or indirect selling through distributors  depending on consumer preferences  local infrastructure  language and marketing methods 
there can be no assurance that the company s primary sales and marketing methods through the direct sales channel in the japanese call center will result in sales at levels that meet or exceed past levels of sales to japan experienced by the company 
the company continues to evaluate the benefits and risks associated with overseas manufacturing for its pc and contract manufacturing operations 
there can be no assurance that the establishment of the japan operation or any other international expansion will be successful  and any failure by the company to achieve success in international operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s international operations are subject to a number of other risks  including  without limitation  fluctuations in the value of currencies  export duties  import controls  trade barriers  restrictions on funds transfer  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections  political and economic instability and compliance with foreign laws 
mti ownership of common stock of the company as of august   mti owned of the company s outstanding common stock 
in addition  four of the eight directors of the company are also directors of mti  including steven r 
appleton  chairman and chief executive officer of mti 
so long as mti continues to own a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company  mti will have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  and generally will have the ability to control the management and certain financial and other affairs of the company 
termination of certain of the company s arrangements by mti or mti exercising its control in negotiating arrangements resulting in terms less favorable to the company could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in the event that mti s ownership of the company were to decrease below certain levels  certain of the company s arrangements with mti could terminate  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see intellectual property matters and spectek memory products operation dependence on component recovery agreement 
as a result of the level of mti s ownership  only a limited percentage of common stock of the company is traded in the public market  which limits the trading liquidity of the common stock of the company and may limit the company s ability to complete future equity financings 
the sale on the open market of substantial amounts of shares of common stock of the company currently held by mti could adversely affect the prevailing market price of common stock of the company 
mti s ability to sell shares of common stock of the company  unless registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  is subject to volume and other restrictions pursuant to rule promulgated under the securities act 
dependence on key personnel the future success of the company will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
the company attempts to enhance its management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skill sets and experience in certain targeted areas 
there is competition for such personnel in the electronics industries  and the company s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  particularly in the areas of information technology  engineering and technical support resources  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company does not currently maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of its employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will not lose key personnel or that the loss of any key personnel will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
government regulation the company is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  federal communications commission regulations  governmental procurement regulations  import and export regulations  federal trade commission regulations  securities regulations  environmental regulations  antitrust regulations  and labor regulations 
any failure by the company to comply with such regulations in the past  present or future could subject the company to liabilities and or the suspension of its operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
personal computer systems competition in the pc industry the pc industry is highly competitive and has been characterized by intense pricing pressure  generally low gross margin percentages  rapid technological advances in hardware and software  frequent introduction of new products  and rapidly declining component costs 
competition in the pc industry is based primarily upon brand name recognition  performance  price  reliability and service and support 
the company s sales of pc systems has historically benefited from increased name recognition and market acceptance of the company s pc systems  primarily resulting from the receipt by the company of awards from trade publications recognizing the price and performance characteristics of micron brand pc systems and the company s service and support functions 
as a result of pc industry standards  the company and its competitors use many of the same components  typically from the same set of suppliers  which limits the company s ability to technologically and functionally differentiate its products 
the company competes with a number of pc manufacturers which sell their products primarily through direct channels  including dell computer  inc and gateway  inc the company also competes with pc manufacturers  such as apple computer  inc  compaq computer corporation  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation and toshiba corporation among others  which have traditionally sold their products through national and regional distributors  dealers and value added resellers  retail stores and direct sales forces 
in addition  the company expects to face increased competition in the us direct sales market from foreign pc suppliers and from foreign and domestic suppliers of pc products that decide to implement  or devote additional resources to  a direct sales strategy 
in order to gain an increased share of the us pc direct sales market  these competitors may effect a pricing strategy that is more aggressive than the current pricing in the direct sales market 
many of the company s pc competitors have greater brand name recognition  offer broader product lines  have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company and may benefit from component volume purchasing and product and process technology license arrangements that are more favorable in terms of pricing and availability than the company s arrangements 
the failure of the company to compete effectively in the marketplace would have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company believes that the rate of growth in worldwide sales of pc systems  particularly in the united states  where the company sells a substantial majority of its pc systems  has declined and may remain below the growth rates experienced in recent years 
any general decline in demand or decline in the rate of increase in demand for pc systems could increase price competition and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
inventory management the company s ability to compete successfully in the pc market in the future will depend in large part on its ability to effectively manage its inventories of pc components 
the company s pc operations focus on the direct sale of assemble to order pc systems that feature components incorporating the latest technological developments in the pc industry 
the company has experienced in the past  and could experience in the future  inventory obsolescence resulting from  among other things  the fast pace of technological developments in the pc industry and the short product life cycles of pc systems and components 
in addition  because high volumes of quality components are required for the manufacture of the company s pc systems  the company has experienced in the past  and expects to experience in the future  shortages and other supply constraints of key components 
such shortages or supply constraints have in the past adversely affected  and could in the future adversely affect  the company s ability to ship products on schedule or at expected gross margins 
to be successful in the future  the company must accurately anticipate demand for its products and obtain adequate supplies of components to meet such demand 
the failure of the company to manage its inventories effectively could result in inventory obsolescence  excess inventories  component shortages and untimely shipment of products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on key sources of supply the company focuses on providing pc systems that feature components and software incorporating the latest technological developments in the pc industry  which components are periodically in short supply and are available from sole or a limited number of suppliers 
as a result  the company has experienced in the past  and expects to experience in the future  shortages in the components used in its pc systems 
the microprocessors used in the company s pc systems are manufactured exclusively by intel and  from time to time  the company has been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of certain intel microprocessors 
in addition  a significant portion of the ram components used in the company s pc systems are supplied by mti  and the company generally relies on mti to supply the latest memory densities and configurations available 
the company relies  to a certain extent  upon its suppliers abilities to enhance existing products in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to respond to emerging standards and other technological developments in the pc industry 
the company s reliance on a limited number of suppliers and on a strategy of incorporating the latest technological developments into its pc systems involves several risks  including the possibility of shortages and or increases in costs of components and software  and risk of reduced control over delivery schedules  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s transport notebook pc systems are currently assembled by third party manufacturers 
these outsourcing arrangements and any future outsourcing arrangements that the company may enter into may reduce the direct control the company has over certain components and the assembly of such products

netframe develops and markets enterprise class multiprocessor servers offering continuous availability and scalability while supporting industry standard software 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets and in process research and development based on their fair values 
the company is performing an ongoing evaluation regarding the nature and scope of the operations of netframe as well as considering various short and long term strategies as to whether and to what extent integration  reconfiguration or other modification of the company s and netframe s separate businesses is appropriate following the acquisition 
there can be no assurance the integration  reconfiguration or other modification  if any  of netframe will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance the company will realize the anticipated benefits associated with the acquisition  including  but not limited to  retention of key personnel  acceptance of netframe products in the market  increased purchasing power  manufacturing efficiencies  technology  intellectual property rights  increased market presence of a broader product offering and economies of providing certain administrative support functions 
state taxation during the third quarter of fiscal  the company began to collect and remit applicable sales or use taxes in nearly all states 
in association therewith  the company is party to agreements with nearly all states which generally limit the liability of the company  if any  for non remittance of sales and use taxes prior to such agreements effective dates 
management believes the resolution of any matters relating to the non remittance of sales or use taxes prior to the balance sheet date will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
contract manufacturing competition in the contract manufacturing industry the company s contract manufacturing operation competes against numerous domestic and offshore contract manufacturers  including a significant number of local and regional companies 
in addition  the company competes against in house manufacturing capabilities of certain of its existing customers as well as with certain large computer manufacturers which offer third party contract manufacturing services 
the company s contract manufacturing competitors include  among others  avex electronics  inc  benchmark electronics  inc  celestica inc  dovatron international  inc  flextronics international  group technologies corporation  jabil circuits  inc  sanmina corporation  sci systems  inc 
and solectron corporation 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater manufacturing  technical  financial  personnel  marketing and other resources than the company and have manufacturing operations at multiple domestic and overseas locations 
the company believes that the significant competitive factors in the contract manufacturing industry include service  quality  price  technology  location and the ability to offer flexible delivery schedules and deliver finished products on an expeditious and timely basis in accordance with customers expectations 
the company may be at a disadvantage as to certain competitive factors when compared to manufacturers with greater resources than the company  substantial offshore facilities or larger domestic facilities 
while the company recently began operation of its first foreign contract manufacturing facility  there can be no assurance that the company s contract manufacturing operation will compete successfully in the future with regard to these factors 
in order to remain competitive  the company may be required to expand its contract manufacturing capacity and may be required to establish additional international operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in expanding its contract manufacturing operation on a timely and efficient basis  or at all 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
customer concentration revenue from the company s top five contract manufacturing customers in was of total contract manufacturing revenue compared to and in and  respectively 
revenue from the company s largest contract manufacturing customer represented of the company s total contract manufacturing revenue in revenue from the company s largest contract manufacturing customer in and represented and  respectively  of the company s total contract manufacturing revenue 
contract manufacturing revenue from mti was of total contract manufacturing revenue in compared to in and in the company expects to continue to experience a high degree of contract manufacturing customer concentration 
the company has no long term agreements with any of its contract manufacturing customers 
the company believes that its key contract manufacturing customers may from time to time materially reduce their purchases of the company s contract manufacturing services in the future 
although the company has generally in the past been able to replace such business with increased business from new or existing customers  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain sufficient alternative business on a timely basis  and the failure to obtain such business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
fluctuations in oem orders the company s contract manufacturing customers generally require short delivery cycles and quick turnaround for contract manufacturing services 
as the company s oem customers react to variations in demand for their products and adjust their purchase orders to the company  the company may be subject to non cancelable purchase orders with its suppliers and may recognize losses on write downs of inventories due primarily to the specialized nature of certain custom components and declines in market pricing of components 
changes in oem orders have had an adverse effect on the company s contract manufacturing operation in the past and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such adverse effects in the future 
spectek semiconductor memory products operation dependence on component recovery agreement with mti historically  a substantial majority of the components used in the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation has been obtained from mti 
the company and mti are parties to a component recovery agreement  effective as of august  the component recovery agreement  under which mti is required to deliver to the company all of the nonstandard dram components produced at mti s semiconductor manufacturing operations 
the company s cost of such components generally is determined as one half of the operating income generated from the company s spectek sales of semiconductor memory products supplied by mti 
there can be no assurance that mti will continue to produce adequate volumes of nonstandard dram components to maintain the company s spectek semiconductor memory products operation at existing or historic levels 
the component recovery agreement  which expires august   may be terminated earlier by mti in the event that mti s ownership of the company falls below 
expiration  termination or renegotiation of the component recovery agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
changes in mti s semiconductor manufacturing processes resulting in improvement of device yields and or changes in the product mix or specifications of its memory components  or other changes or events at mti adversely affecting its overall manufacturing output  could adversely affect the volume of nonstandard dram components supplied by mti 
many semiconductor memory manufacturers are reluctant to sell nonstandard dram components because such components could compete with their full specification dram components for similar applications 
in addition  some manufacturers are concerned that subsequent testing performed by a recovery operation could reveal proprietary data regarding manufacturing yields and processes 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain nonstandard dram components from semiconductor manufacturers in quantities sufficient to meet demand for the company s spectek products 
any reduction in the availability or functionality of nonstandard dram components from the company s suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
pricing of dram products pricing for the company s spectek semiconductor memory products fluctuates  to a large degree  based on industry wide pricing for semiconductor memory products 
the company has experienced significant declines in the average selling prices of its spectek semiconductor memory products as industry wide average selling prices for full specification semiconductor memory products experienced a sharp decline 
the company believes that such decline in average selling prices of semiconductor memory products was due primarily to changes in the balance of supply and demand for these commodity products  and the company is unable to predict the impact of semiconductor memory product market dynamics in future periods 
due to increased market risk associated with holding purchased memory components in inventory  the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  losses from write downs of memory component inventories in periods of declining prices 
further declines in pricing for semiconductor memory products would likely result in declines in average selling prices of the company s spectek semiconductor memory products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations
