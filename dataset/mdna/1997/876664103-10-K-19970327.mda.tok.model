item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  the financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto and the consolidated financial statements of the taubman realty group limited partnership and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement the company  through its interest in and as managing general partner of trg  participates in trg s managed businesses 
trg s managed businesses include i wholly owned taubman shopping centers  development projects for future regional shopping centers development projects and the taubman company limited partnership the manager  collectively  the consolidated businesses  and ii taubman shopping centers partially owned through joint ventures joint ventures 
trg consolidates the wholly owned taubman shopping centers  the development projects  and the manager 
the joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method in trg s consolidated financial statements 
certain aspects of the performance of the managed businesses are best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to trg s ownership interest 
for example  mall tenant sales and shopping center occupancy trends fit this category and are so analyzed below 
in addition  trends in certain items of revenue and expense are often best understood in the same fashion  and the discussions following take this approach when appropriate 
when relevant  these items are also discussed separately with regard to the consolidated businesses and the joint ventures 
mall tenant sales and center revenues over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the taubman shopping centers because mall tenants provide over of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
the company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales 
mall tenant sales in thousands    sales per square foot minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs sales per square foot was  excluding bellevue center 
occupancy historically  average annual occupancy for trg as a whole has been within a narrow band 
in the last ten years  average annual occupancy has ranged between and 
rental rates as leases have expired in the taubman shopping centers  trg has generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following table contains certain information regarding per square foot base rent  excluding renewals  at taubman shopping centers that have been owned and open for five years 
store store difference all closings openings between mall during during opening and tenants year year closing rents average average average average base annualized annualized annualized rent base rent base rent base rent includes centers owned and open prior to january  includes centers owned and open prior to january  trg anticipates that the spread between opening and closing rents will narrow in this statistic is difficult to predict in part because trg s leasing policies and practices may result in early lease terminations with actual average closing rents which may vary from the average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations 
in addition  the opening or closing of large tenant spaces  which generally pay a lower rent per square foot  can significantly change the spread in a given year 
seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
the following table summarizes certain quarterly operating data for trg s managed businesses for st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter total in thousands mall tenant sales      revenues      occupancy average occupancy ending occupancy leased space because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents and expense recoveries relative to sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of sales for each quarter of st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter total minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs results of operations equity transactions in december  the company purchased  newly issued trg units of partnership interest with the million proceeds from the company s december offering of million shares of common stock

the tax status of total dividends declared and to be declared  assuming continuation of a per common share quarterly dividend  is estimated to be approximately return of capital  and approximately of ordinary income 
this is a forward looking statement and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including the amount of dividends declared  changes in the company s share of anticipated taxable income of trg due to the actual results of trg  changes in the number of the company s outstanding shares  property acquisitions or dispositions  financing transactions  including refinancing of existing debt  and changes in the internal revenue code or its application

the payment of the principal and interest is recourse to each of the owners of arizona mills  llc to the extent of their ownership percentage 
trg owns a interest in arizona mills  llc distributions a principal factor considered by trg in deciding upon distributions to partners is an amount  which trg defines as distributable cash flow  equal to ebitda less trg s beneficial interest expense and non real estate depreciation and amortization 
this measure of performance is influenced not only by operations but also by capital structure 
ebitda is defined as trg s beneficial interest in revenues  less operating costs before interest  depreciation and amortization  meaning trg s pro rata share of this result for each of the managed businesses  after recording appropriate intercompany eliminations 
trg s beneficial interest expense is defined as of the interest expense of trg s consolidated businesses and trg s pro rata share of the interest expense on the debt of the joint ventures 
funds from operations is calculated by adding the company s beneficial interest in trg s distributable cash flow to the company s other income  less the company s operating expenses 
ebitda  distributable cash flow and funds from operations do not represent cash flows from operations  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
however  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit suggests that funds from operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
in march  nareit issued a clarification of the definition of funds from operations 
beginning in  the company modified its calculation of funds from operations and trg s calculation of distributable cash flow to be consistent with nareit s clarified definition 
as a result  trg adjusted the depreciation and amortization amount added back to net income to include only depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry 
distributable cash flow and funds from operations for have been restated in the table below to reflect the clarified definition 
the following table summarizes trg s distributable cash flow and the company s funds from operations for the years ended december  and year ended year ended december  december  trg trg consolidated joint consolidated joint businesses ventures total businesses ventures total in millions of dollars trg s net income gain on disposition of bellevue extraordinary items depreciation and amortization trg s beneficial interest expense ebitda trg s beneficial interest expense non real estate depreciation distributable cash flow tci s share of distributable cash flow other income expenses  net funds from operations amounts represent trg s beneficial interest in the operations of its joint ventures

in  trg recognized an ordinary gain of million and an extraordinary gain of million related to the disposition of bellevue 
extraordinary charges related to the extinguishment of debt  primarily consisting of prepayment penalties  were recorded in and amounts represent trg s and trg s beneficial interest in the joint ventures extraordinary items  depreciation and amortization  and interest expense 
includes million and million of amortization of mall tenant allowances in and  respectively 
distributable cash flow and funds from operations have been restated from the previously reported amounts for of million and million  respectively 
amounts may not add due to rounding 
for  ebitda and distributable cash flow were million and million  compared to million and million  as restated  in trg distributed million to its partners in  compared to million in the company s funds from operations for was million  compared to million  as restated  in the partnership committee of trg makes an annual determination of appropriate distributions for each year 
the determination is based on anticipated distributable cash flow  as well as financing considerations and such other factors as the partnership committee considers appropriate 
further  the partnership committee has decided that the growth in distributions will be less than the growth in distributable cash flow for the immediate future 
except under unusual circumstances  trg s practice is to distribute equal monthly installments of the determined amount of distributions throughout the year 
due to seasonality and the fact that cash available to trg for distributions may be more or less than net cash provided from operating activities plus distributions from joint ventures during the year  trg may borrow from unused credit facilities described in liquidity and capital resources trg above to enable it to distribute the amount decided upon by the trg partnership committee 
distributions by each joint venture may be made only in accordance with the terms of its partnership agreement 
trg acts as the managing partner in each case and  in general  has the right to determine the amount of cash available for distribution from the joint venture 
in general  the provisions of these agreements require the distribution of all available cash as defined in each partnership agreement  but most do not allow borrowing to finance distributions without approval of the joint venture partner 
as a result  distribution policies of many joint ventures will not parallel those of trg
