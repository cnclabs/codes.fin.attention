overview the company is a full service metals recycler primarily engaged in the collection and processing of various ferrous and non ferrous metals for resale to domestic and foreign steel producers and other metal producers and processors 
prior to may  the company was a development stage enterprise engaged in the development of the msw technology 
although the company has not obtained a permit or constructed a facility utilizing the msw technology  the company is pursuing the licensing or sale of this technology to third parties 
the company s current operations commenced in may with the acquisition of nri 
since that time  the company has experienced significant growth from the acquisition of other metals recycling facilities

the company believes these acquisitions will have a positive impact on its future results of operations  and accordingly believes that the company s historical results should be considered in conjunction with the pro forma results

results of operations the company s operating results depend in large part on its ability to effectively manage the purchase  processing and sale of scrap metals 
the demand for processed ferrous and non ferrous scrap is subject to general economic  industry and market specific conditions beyond the company s control which may result in periodic fluctuations in the sales prices of the company s products 
the company seeks to maintain its operating margins by adjusting the purchase price for raw ferrous and non ferrous scrap in response to such fluctuations  subject to local market conditions 
although the company is unable to hedge against changes in market prices  it seeks to minimize this risk by maintaining low inventory levels of raw and processed scrap

the company believes it should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most raw material cost increases resulting from inflation  although there may be some delay between raw material cost increases and sales price increases and competitive factors may require the company to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases
