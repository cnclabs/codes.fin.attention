results of operations fiscal years and electronic clearing house  inc recorded a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended september   compared with a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in net loss for fiscal year was mainly attributable to a  increase in research and development expenses primarily related to a pilot program for the united states postal service usps  the  of non recurring lawsuit settlement income recorded in fiscal year  and a  increase in interest expense during fiscal the company showed a loss of  from operations which can be attributed to its equipment subsidiary  computer based controls  inc cbc and expenses related to the usps pilot and other direct and indirect costs associated with cbc 
profitable operations of the company s processing activities was attained in the latter part of fiscal and gradually increased through fiscal the company is expected to be able to continue to increase its profitability from its bankcard processing operations for fiscal due to the anticipated increase in its merchant base from its existing marketing programs  increased transaction activity from its association with a national rental organization  and from the newly developed telemerchant and internet processing programs initiated during the first quarter of bankcard processing revenue  bankcard transactions fees  and check guarantee fees for fiscal year increased to  from  for fiscal year revenues derived from the electronic processing of transactions are recognized at the time the transactions are processed by the merchant 
the increase in bankcard processing revenues resulted primarily from the increase in the number of active merchant accounts from  as of september  to  a increase 
the company s expanding merchant base and profitability is primarily attributable to the following programs 
the first factor is the effective sales efforts of an independent processing related sales organization that is presently accounting for approximately of the company s new merchant relationships 
secondly  referral from the company s existing merchant base and the direct response to the company s internet home page account for approximately of the company s merchant growth 
third  the company s new agent bank program  actively promoted in the first quarter of fiscal  is resulting in increased merchant relationships and increased processing volume as a result of the acquisition of the existing merchants already processing with the agent banks 
fourth  inventory transactions revenue for a national rental organization increased from fiscal additionally  during fiscal year  the company targeted merchant industry types which generally have higher discount rates and processing volume as compared to the typical retail merchant 
a primary contingency related to processing profitability is the consistency and multiplicity of the company s primary bank relationships 
primary bank relationships are necessary to assure access to the major credit card issuing organizations and  presently  the company has two primary bank relationships 
additional primary bank relationships diminish the potential for disruptions in processing operations that might occur due to changes in management or ownership of one of the company s primary banks 
the company has signed letters of intent with two additional banks as primary banks 
the company is making the necessary software enhancements to allow the new primary banks to become active by the second quarter of fiscal bankcard processing expenses have generally remained constant as a percentage of processing revenue 
a majority of the company s bankcard processing expenses are fixed as a percentage of each transaction amount  with the remaining costs being based on a fixed rate applied to the transactions processed 
processing related expenses  consisting of bankcard processing expense  check guarantee expense and customer service expense  increased to  from  for fiscal this was in direct relation to the increase in processing revenues 
check guarantee fees have decreased from  to  and related expenses have decreased from  to  reflecting the absence of active marketing or development of the company s check guarantee services 
check guarantee services are not presently actively promoted for two primary reasons  negative check writer data are only available on california activity while much of the company s base of merchants are in other states  and development focus and resources are being placed in bankcard processing and terminal sales programs that are viewed by management to have a higher growth and revenue potential 
the primary variables affecting equipment sales are inventory levels  software design and development by the company  the timing of customer orders and the lead time required for delivery of such orders 
the company s primary terminal system  the eb  is a highly customer specific terminal and for this reason  as well as the financial costs related thereto  the company does not maintain significant on hand inventory beyond depot requirements 
customer orders have historically been in large quantities that exceed the inventory amounts the company maintains and such orders are typically received only one or two times per year per customer 
the time from receipt of the customer s order to the delivery of the systems is presently a four month period  primarily due to the lead times of electronic components for the system 
subsequent to september   the company received an order for  eba terminals from its national rental organization customer 
revenue related to terminal sales are recognized when the equipment is shipped 
terminal sales and lease revenue for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal this significant reduction in revenue between the two periods can be attributed to two primary causes 
first  the company s equipment subsidiary focused much of the year on performance under an award by the usps that generated no revenue during the year 
secondly   systems were delivered to two major accounts in and  to one account in due to the type of customer who finds the company s equipment useful  larger orders placed annually are the norm rather than small orders placed more frequently 
this inherent difference in similar periods makes revenue comparison more difficult 
related costs have decreased  directly related to the lower sales 
research and development revenue increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  reflecting an increase in fee paid developmental work for existing customers 
research and development expense increased from  to  for the same period  reflecting primarily the developmental effort required under a pilot program to design and deploy electronic money order systems for the usps that was awarded to the company in november the company decided to invest a significant portion of its resources in the usps pilot program for two primary reasons  the potential exists for a national program with the usps if the pilot program proves to be successful  and the new system will meet the needs of other customers and markets that the company feels it can solicit effectively 
there was a decrease in equipment sales expense from  for fiscal to  for fiscal this decrease reflects a reduction in the direct sales efforts on behalf of the company s equipment subsidiary  cbc 
general and administrative expense decreased marginally from  for fiscal to  for fiscal this is a result of the company s ability to effectively control costs and the effects of an in house automation program that lowers operating costs while allowing increased processing volume 
interest expense increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal this is mainly attributable to the interest amortization expense related to warrants issued during as a consideration for the extension of certain existing and new term loans 
liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had a  working capital as compared to  negative working capital in fiscal year this increase in working capital primarily reflects the increase in cash and restricted cash as of september  the company had available cash of  and  of restricted cash in reserve with its primary processing bank as of september  subsequent to september   the company received a  downpayment on an order for  eba terminals 
accounts receivable increased  from september  to september  this increase was the result of increases in the number of merchants and the increases in processing volume in fiscal year inventory increased  from september  to september  this increase was primarily related to the inventory build up for the usps pilot program 
short term borrowings increased  as a result of  convertible notes which are due in march capital expenditures were approximately  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal capital expenditures in were primarily the result of purchase of tooling for the company s manufacturing processes and upgrades to computer systems 
the significant increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year resulted from the sale of  of series k preferred stock  the issuance of  of short term notes  and  from the proceeds of warrants and options exercised 
the report of the company s independent accountants during the past ten years has contained an explanatory paragraph as to the uncertainty of the company s ability to continue as a going concern resulting from recurring losses 
the profitability of the company s processing activities diminishes this risk significantly even though cbc is expected to continue to operate at a loss for fiscal year cbc s activities are being focused almost entirely on the performance under the usps pilot program and other developmental projects are being postponed 
this concentration of energy and resources has resulted in an operating loss in the fiscal year from cbc activities alone that exceeds the total operating loss shown by the company in fiscal year since the development portion of the usps pilot program is nearing completion  continued investment at the current level into cbc is not expected to be necessary in fiscal year and as a result  the operating losses for cbc are expected to be reduced significantly 
in november   cbc was awarded a contract to design and build electronic money order dispensers emod for the usps 
the first article test of the cbc beta system was done in september and passed approximately of the necessary criteria 
a re testing is scheduled for the first quarter  fiscal  and  if successful  it is anticipated that a phased deployment of the systems will occur in the dallas  texas area beginning in the first quarter of calendar year the usps has advised the company that they are having difficulty in securing a printing company that is able to economically produce the desired emod form stock with the necessary security components 
this may delay decisions regarding further deployment after the pilot program begins and or may generate the need for a redesign of the existing systems to accommodate a modified paper stock 
such events are not certain but possible 
based upon continued growth in its processing operations and the recent order of  eba terminals  cash flow from operations is expected to be positive in fiscal year as described above in results of operations  contingencies that could impact liquidity are mitigated by continuing successes in the expansion of the customer base and by the establishment of multiple banking relationships 
in november   of short term debt was converted into  shares of common stock 
the remaining  of short term debt is also convertible into common stock at 
a share 
the company is reviewing its options to either refinance the  debt or effect repayment through private placement funds when the notes become due in march and april of if the conversion option has not been exercised by the noteholders at that time 
at september   the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as compared to at september  the twelve month average collection period for receivables was days for fiscal year as compared to days for fiscal year the company s annualized inventory turnover ratios for fiscal year was  as compared to for fiscal year when used in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this document  the words believes  anticipates  contemplates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
those risks and uncertainties included changes in economic conditions locally and nationally  and changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s primary lines of business 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events
