overview netopia develops  markets and supports complete  easy to use  plug and play internet connectivity and networking solutions and real time collaboration software to increase the productivity and efficiency of internet  intranet and lan users 
the company was founded in and initially focused on the development of networking products for appletalk lans  including the phonenet network system 
historically  the company has derived a substantial majority of its revenues from its lan products 
in  the company revised its business strategy to concentrate on the internet and intranet markets through the utilization of its tcp ip and routing expertise 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company released its timbuktu pro internet intranet collaboration software product tcp ip enabled  and in the first quarter of fiscal  the company introduced its netopia family of internet connectivity products and services 
although the company has experienced growth in internet intranet product revenues over the last four years  the company does not believe prior growth rates are sustainable or indicative of future internet intranet operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company s limited internet intranet operating history and the dynamic market environment in which the company competes makes the prediction of future internet intranet operating results difficult  if not impossible 
the company s total revenues are derived from the sale of internet intranet connectivity and software products and farallon division of lan connectivity products 
internet intranet product revenues include license revenues for its timbuktu pro and netopia virtual office software  sales of the netopia family of internet connectivity products  and fees for related services as well as revenue from licensing the company s patent covering cross platform screen sharing technology 
lan products revenue is derived primarily from the sale of ethernet  etherwave  fast ethernet and localtalk compatible products which include the phonenet system network connectivity products and  historically  remote access and lan software 
revenue relating to the sale and licensing of hardware and software products is recognized upon shipment of the products by the company  patent revenue is recognized upon the licensing of the rights to the patent and service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
certain of the company s sales are made to customers under agreements permitting limited rights of return for stock balancing or with protection for future price decreases 
revenue is recorded net of an estimated allowance for returns 
any product returns or price decreases in the future that exceed the company s allowances may materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as the company continues to focus on increasing its internet intranet business  and as a result of variable average selling prices of the company s lan products  declining sales of mac os computers and competitive factors  the company expects that lan products revenue may decline and may account for a decreasing percentage of total revenues in future periods to the extent that internet intranet product revenues increase 
as a result  the company s future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of its internet intranet products and enhancements thereto 
historically  the company has been dependent upon sales of its lan products  and to the extent that continuing declines in revenues from lan products is not offset by increases in revenue from other sources  such as sales of the company s internet intranet products  then the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the company s gross margin has varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future depending primarily on the mix of products sold by the company and external market factors including but not limited to price competition 
the company s timbuktu pro and netopia virtual office collaboration software products have a higher average gross margin than the balance of the company s products 
accordingly  to the extent the product mix for any particular quarter includes a substantial proportion of lower margin products  there will be a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
netopia sells its internet intranet and lan products and related maintenance  support and other services primarily through distributors  while certain products are also sold directly through select isps and vars or directly by the company to corporate accounts and higher education institutions 
revenues from distributors accounted for  of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and of the company s total revenue for each of fiscal and the company s three largest distributors accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to use its existing isps and vars to sell the company s internet intranet products  and to recruit additional isps and vars and pursue other marketing channels in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company s current distributors will choose to or be able to market the company s products effectively  that economic conditions or industry demand will not adversely affect these or other distributors  or that these distributors will not devote greater resources to marketing products of other companies 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in revenue from  one of the company s distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
international revenues accounted for of the company s total revenues for each of fiscal  and  and are derived primarily from europe and japan 
the company s international revenues are currently denominated in united states dollars  and revenues generated by the company s distributors currently are paid to the company in united states dollars 
the results of the company s international operations may fluctuate from period to period based on global economic factors including  but not limited to  the current economic situation in asia and japan and movements in currency exchange rates 
historically  movements in exchange rates have not materially affected the company s total revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that movements in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues in the future 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenues 
any significant decline in international demand for the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company believes that in order to increase sales opportunities and profitability it will be required to expand its international operations 
the company has committed and continues to commit significant management attention and financial resources to developing international sales and support channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
in addition  sales of the company s lan products are dependent upon the international demand for apple products 
to the extent that the company is unable to maintain or increase international demand for its products  or that international demand for apple products does not meet the company s expectations  the company s international sales will be limited  and the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s international business is subject to inherent risks  including but not limited to the impact of possible and existing recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse tax consequences and political and economic instability 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia including the people s republic of china  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase international revenues  or that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international revenues and its business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has a substantial portion of its products and components manufactured by foreign suppliers 
the company s operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international purchases  including  but not limited to  various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  transportation delays  export import controls  tariff regulations  higher freight rates and potentially adverse tax consequences 
duty  tariff and freight costs can materially increase the cost of crucial components for the company s products 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data of the company expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended september  revenues internet intranet products lan products total revenues cost of revenues internet intranet products lan products total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss years ended september   and revenues 
the company s total revenues increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and decreased to million for fiscal internet intranet products revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and increased to million for fiscal the increase in internet intranet revenues for fiscal was due to the introduction and initial market acceptance of isdn versions of the company s netopia family of internet connectivity products and services  increased sales of the windows versions of timbuktu pro collaboration software particularly volume licenses in corporate intranets  upgrade cycles and increased volume licenses related to the macintosh version of timbuktu pro as well as the licensing of the company s patent covering cross platform screen sharing technology 
exclusive of the patent license  revenues from timbuktu pro decreased slightly late in fiscal reflecting a decrease in sales of the macintosh version of timbuktu pro  partially offset by a slight growth in sales of the windows version of timbuktu pro 
the increase in internet intranet revenues for fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of international versions of isdn routers which were introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the fiscal first quarter introduction of the so smart isdn routers domestically  a greater number of regional isps selling the netopia family of internet connectivity products and increased sales of the windows versions of timbuktu pro 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of the macintosh version of timbuktu pro  decreased revenue from patent licenses and price competition related to isdn routers 
the company believes the decline in timbuktu pro mac products reflects declining sales of macintosh computers and apple s loss of market share 
lan products revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and decreased to million for fiscal the decrease in lan revenues for fiscal was due to declining sales and average selling prices of etherwave and localtalk products  partially offset by the introduction of new ethernet  fast ethernet and oem ethernet products 
the decrease in lan revenues for fiscal was primarily due to decreased sales and average selling prices of etherwave and localtalk products and declining average selling prices of the company s ethernet products  partially offset by new fast ethernet and ethernet product introductions 
although fast ethernet and ethernet product revenue benefited in fiscal years and from new product introductions  the increase was partially offset by declining demand for certain ethernet products  price competition and vendor incorporation of built in ethernet connectivity into certain new computers 
the company also believes declining etherwave sales are primarily a result of price competition from standard base t hubs  cards and transceivers as well as vendor incorporation of built in ethernet connectivity into certain new computers 
overall  the company believes its lan products continue to be adversely affected by declining sales of macintosh computers and apple s loss of market share 
to the extent that the company continues to experience weakened demand for its products such as timbuktu pro mac  etherwave  localtalk and ethernet products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
internet intranet products revenue accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  while lan products revenue accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues from distributors accounted for of the company s total revenues for fiscal and of the company s total revenue for each of fiscal and the decrease in the percentage of revenues from distributors was primarily due to declining sales of the company s lan products which are sold primarily through the distribution channel 
revenues from ingram accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  and revenues from microwarehouse accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
no other customers have accounted for or more of the company s total revenues during fiscal  and international revenues accounted for of total revenues for each of fiscal  and although international revenues remained flat as a percentage of total revenue from fiscal to fiscal  they increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal primarily due to increased sales in the pacific rim which the company believes were partially offset late in the fiscal by delays  technical difficulties and interrupted supply of apple powerbooks and decreased international sales of other apple products 
although international revenues remained flat as a percentage of total revenue from fiscal to fiscal  they decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal primarily due to decreased sales in the pacific rim 
revenues from the pacific rim region decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the company believes the decline in international revenue is primarily due to recessionary economic conditions in japan as well as eroding apple market share worldwide 
to the extent that the company continues to experience weakened international demand for its products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin for internet intranet and lan products is affected by many factors  including but not limited to pricing strategies  royalties paid to third parties  new versions of existing products and product mix 
the company s total gross margin decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  and increased to for fiscal internet intranet products gross margin decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  and decreased to for fiscal the decrease in internet intranet products gross margin for fiscal was primarily due to the introduction of netopia internet connectivity products which have lower gross margins than the company s internet intranet software products  partially offset by the licensing of the company s patent covering cross platform screen sharing technology 
the decrease in internet intranet products gross margin for fiscal was primarily due to the increased sales of netopia internet connectivity products which have lower gross margins than the company s internet intranet software products and decreased revenue from patent licenses 
the company s gross margin for lan products decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal and decreased to for fiscal the decrease in lan products gross margins for fiscal were primarily due to declining sales and average selling prices on the company s higher margin etherwave and localtalk products and increased sales of lower margin ethernet and fast ethernet products 
additionally  lan products gross margins were adversely affected in fiscal  by a non recurring charge to cost of sales resulting from standard cost reductions on inventory as well as additional inventory reserves the company recorded in the fourth quarter 
these reserves were primarily related to fast ethernet products which had experienced market acceptance below the company s expectations 
the decrease for fiscal was primarily related to declining sales of higher margin etherwave and localtalk products and average selling price reductions as a result of price competition 
this decrease was partially offset by increased sales of certain higher margin ethernet products for macintosh clones and retrofit upgrades as well as cost reductions as a result of transferring certain production offshore and continued product re engineering 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and decreased to million for fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily a result of additional headcount and other employee related expenses related to the development of the company s internet intranet products 
the decrease for fiscal was primarily due to decreased development related expenses as well as decreased incentives  recruiting  travel and contractor expenses partially offset by increased salaries and international localization of the company s internet intranet products 
such expenses represented  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that it will continue to devote substantial resources to product and technological development and that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal historically  the company has believed its process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility and no internal software costs have been capitalized to date 
during fiscal   of product development costs incurred subsequent to the delivery of a working model  under a development agreement with a third party  have been capitalized 
no software development costs were capitalized during fiscal or the company may enter into further development agreements in which the company may be required to capitalize certain costs of software development 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and decreased to million for fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily due to increased headcount with the addition of direct software and netopia internet connectivity sales forces and associated expenses as well as increased advertising and promotional spending relating to the introduction of the company s new netopia internet connectivity products and internet applets 
the decrease for fiscal was primarily due to decreased print advertising and other marketing related expenses  as the company continues to focus on electronic marketing efforts  partially offset by increased headcount and related expenses as well as increased telecommunications expenses 
such expenses represented  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes selling and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal primarily due to increased personnel related expenses and increased advertising and promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and decreased to million for fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily due to consulting fees related to the acquisition of the netopia trademark and increased personnel related expenses 
the decrease for fiscal was primarily due to reduced consulting fees and employee related expenses partially offset by increased accounting services  legal services and insurance expense related to being a public company 
such expenses represented  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that general and administrative costs will increase in absolute dollars for fiscal as the company continues to incur additional costs of being a public company  such as expenses related to directors and officers insurance  investor relations and increased professional fees 
other income  net 
other income  net  represents interest earned by the company on its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments offset by interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the effective tax rate for fiscal  excluding the effect of an adjustment to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  was 
the effective tax rate for fiscal  including the effect of an adjustment to the valuation allowance  was 
excluding the impact of changes in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  these rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to research tax credits and tax exempt interest income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company reversed a full valuation allowance that it had previously provided against its deferred tax assets  resulting in a non recurring income tax benefit of approximately million 
prior to the reversal  the company believed that  based upon available objective evidence  there was sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets to warrant a full valuation allowance 
the factors considered included prior losses  inconsistent profits  lack of carryback potential to realize deferred tax assets  dependence on lan products and associated declining market and gross margins for lan products  dependence upon apple and uncertain market acceptance of its internet intranet products 
during fiscal  the company believed that due to the demonstrated market acceptance of its new internet intranet products  the uncertainty regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets had diminished to the point where it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
in fiscal  the company believed that  based upon available objective evidence  there was sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of certain of its deferred tax assets to warrant a partial valuation allowance  primarily related to the expected realizability of its research credit carryforwards 
the factors considered included the relatively shorter product life cycles in the high technology industry and the uncertainty of longer term taxable income estimates related thereto  and limits on the carryback potential for realizing certain deferred tax assets 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the approximately million in net deferred tax assets as of september   but no assurances can be provided in that regard 
to the extent that the company cannot achieve consistent profitability in the near future or as a result of acquisition or divestiture activity  the company may be required to record a full valuation allowance against its remaining net deferred tax assets 
in the event the company records a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  the company s operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
other factors that may affect future results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this report  and the risks discussed in the company s other united states securities and exchange commission filings 
fluctuations in quarterly results  future operating results uncertain 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
for example  the company has recently experienced quarterly losses and experienced a loss for fiscal the company s results depend on factors such as changes in networking and communications technologies  price and product competition  usage of the internet and developments and changes in the internet market  the demand for the company s products  demand for apple s products  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  including the grant of price protection terms and discounts by the company  changes in the mix of products sold by the company and the resulting change in total gross margin  changes in the mix of channels through which the company s products are offered  product enhancements and new product announcements by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products of the company or its competitors  raw material costs  write offs of obsolete inventory  the size and timing of distributor and end user orders and purchasing cycles  customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements to the company s or competitors products  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new macos product offerings and the elimination of a number of macintosh cloning licenses issued by apple  customer order deferrals for budgetary or other reasons including but not limited to government programs such as e rate  manufacturing delays  disruptions in sources of supply  product life cycles  product quality problems  personnel changes  changes in the company s strategy  changes in the level of operating expenses  the timing of research and development expenditures  the level of the company s international revenues  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  general economic conditions  both in the united states and abroad  and economic conditions specific to the industries in which the company competes  among others 
the company s limited internet intranet operating history and the dynamic market environment in which the company competes makes the prediction of future internet intranet operating results difficult  if not impossible 
sales orders are typically shipped shortly after receipt and  consequently  order backlog at the beginning of any quarter has in the past represented only a small portion of that quarter s revenues 
accordingly  the company s net revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped during that quarter 
historically  the company has often shipped and recognized a significant portion of its revenues in the last weeks  or even days  of a quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations may not become evident until late in  or after the close of a particular quarter 
the company typically experiences significant volumes of shipments at the end of the quarter which may be exposed to delays caused by shipping halts or other factors beyond the company s control 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue on products sold through distributors upon shipment to the distributor 
although the company maintains reserves for projected returns and price decreases  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate 
the company s business also has experienced seasonality in the past  largely due to customer buying patterns such as budgeting cycles of educational institutions that purchase the company s products and the summer slow down in most european markets 
there can be no assurance that the company s operating results will not be affected by seasonality in the future or that such seasonality will occur in a manner consistent with prior periods 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on expectations as to future revenues and as a result are relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenues are below expectations in any given quarter  net income or loss is likely to be disproportionately affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and other factors discussed herein  revenues and net income or loss for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company s business strategies will be successful or that the company will be able to return to or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
management of changing business 
the company has shifted its business strategy from providing only lan products to reducing its reliance on lan products and focusing development and management efforts on its internet intranet business 
this transition represents a significant challenge for the company and its administrative  operational and financial resources and places increased demands on its systems and controls 
the company s ability to manage the continuing development of its internet intranet business will require the company to continue to change  expand and improve its operational  management and financial systems and controls and to expand its manufacturing capabilities 
this transition has resulted in a continuing increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company anticipates that any growth in its internet intranet business will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  sales and marketing  customer service  administrative and managerial personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining these personnel  if needed 
in addition  certain aspects of the company s internet intranet business require volume sales to achieve profitability 
if the company is unable to achieve such volumes or to manage the transition effectively  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
litigation 
from time to time  the company has received claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
although the company believes that all such claims received to date are without merit or are immaterial  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or other claims in the future with respect to the company s current or future products or activities 
the company expects that it will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the company s industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against the company and failure or inability of the company to license the infringed or similar technology  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  the company may be involved in litigation or administrative claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business 
in the event of a successful claim against the company  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
risks associated with potential acquisitions or divestitures 
the company may acquire or invest in companies  technologies or products that complement the company s business or its product offerings 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate performance of all its products and product lines and may sell or discontinue current technologies  products or products lines 
any acquisitions or divestiture may result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the write off of software development costs or other assets  the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and or the incurrence of debt  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions or divestiture would involve numerous additional risks including difficulties in the assimilation or separation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the disruption of the company s business  the entry into markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered 
tariff and regulatory matters 
the company is not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally 
however  rates for telecommunications services are governed by tariffs of licensed carriers that are subject to regulatory approval 
future changes in these tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  if tariffs for public switched digital services increase in the future relative to tariffs for private leased services  then the cost effectiveness of the company s products would be reduced and its business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company s telecommunications products must meet standards and receive certification for connection to public telecommunications networks prior to their sale 
in the united states  such products must comply with part a industrial equipment  part b residential equipment and part analog and isdn lines of the federal communications commission regulations 
the company s telecommunications products also must be certified by certain domestic telecommunications carriers 
in foreign countries  such products are subject to a wide variety of governmental review and certification requirements 
while certain foreign countries and the european economic community regulate the importation and certification of the company s products  most foreign customers typically require that the company s products receive certification from their country s primary telecommunication carriers 
any future inability to obtain on a timely basis or retain domestic regulatory approvals and certification or foreign regulatory approvals  including safety and telecommunications  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the shares of the company s common stock is highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s results of operations  announcements of technological innovations  introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents  copyrights or proprietary rights  conditions and trends in the networking and other technology industries  changes in or failure by the company to meet securities analysts expectations  general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
there can be no assurance that such litigation will not occur in the future with respect to the company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through cash flow from operations  the private sale of equity securities and the initial public offering ipo of the company s common stock 
since inception  the company has raised million from the private sale of equity securities and approximately million  net of offering expenses  from the company s ipo completed in june  as of september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments representing of total assets 
the company generated cash from operating activities of million in fiscal  used million in fiscal and generated million in fiscal the cash used in operations in fiscal was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable related to volume license sales of the company s software products  that occurred in the last weeks of the fourth quarter ended september   increases in operating expenses related to the introduction of netopia internet connectivity hardware products  reduction in accounts payable and increases in inventory related to the company s new netopia hardware and fast ethernet products 
the cash generated by operations in fiscal was primarily due to collection of accounts receivable and decreased inventory  partially offset by reductions of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
netopia internet connectivity products represented and of total gross inventory at september  and  respectively  and fast ethernet products represented and of total gross inventory at september  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities in fiscal  and  have related primarily to the purchases of capital equipment and short term investment activity 
expenditures for capital equipment totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  primarily representing acquisitions of tooling and test fixtures for new products as well as computer equipment used predominantly in product development 
the company expects that its capital expenditures may increase in future periods to support new product development and production 
the company s financing activities in fiscal  and  represent activity on loans  exercise of stock options  the ipo and activities related to the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the company s principal commitments consist primarily of leases on its headquarters facilities and operating equipment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to meet its cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
a portion of the company s cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
the company has no agreements or commitments and is not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to any such transaction
