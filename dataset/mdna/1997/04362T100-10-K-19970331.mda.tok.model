previously  the lease payments were based upon usage by the company 
the effect of this change in and is not quantifiable 
effective july   the leases were renegotiated by lowering imputed interest to a fixed rate and adjusting the residual balance to more closely approximate the fair market value of the trailers at the end of the expected life of each lease 
these leases are accounted for as capital leases 
this change reduced interest expense by approximately million and decreased net loss by approximately million net loss per common share in this change reduced interest expense by approximately million and decreased net loss by approximately million net loss per common share in payments to related parties on capital lease obligations in  and were   and  respectively 
seasonality the company s results of operations show a seasonal pattern because certain of the frozen food companies serviced by the company generally reduce shipments during the summer season 
during the winter months  the company has at times experienced delays in meeting its pick up and delivery schedules as a result of severe weather conditions 
in addition  the company s operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
accordingly such factors cause fluctuations in results of operations 
the foliage division of asche transfer experiences seasonal fluctuations in volume during certain periods of the year
