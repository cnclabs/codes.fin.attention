another example is lnrc s joint ownership of reinsurance marketing remark  a direct marketing company based in the netherlands that seeks out business opportunities with banks and insurers

however  lnrc s financial reinsurance operating earnings grew by more than million in to million  halting a two year decline 
trends are emerging that represent growth opportunities in this business 
for example  as the property casualty insurance industry consolidates  some companies are seeking financial reinsurance and finite risk solutions rather than traditional catastrophic reinsurance

the use of annuity reinsurance to cover investment risk is another growth opportunity  as is the development of blended reinsurance and capital markets instruments 
disability income lincoln life  the largest company in lnc s life insurance and annuities segment  withdrew from the difficult direct disability income market in since the fourth quarter of  lnrc has managed lincoln life s block of direct disability income business as well as its own block of reinsurance disability income business

losses were million in lnc took a charge against earnings of million  after tax  in the fourth quarter of to strengthen reserves related to its direct and reinsurance individual disability income business 
the reserves were established assuming that recent experience would continue 
if incidence levels or claim terminations vary significantly from lnc s assumptions  further adjustments to reserves may be required 
outlook lnrc s organizational shift in to a global reinsurance consultant that senses and responds to client needs with mass customized solutions is expected to significantly enhance revenue growth 
lnrc also should benefit by continuing to build partnerships with financial institutions that are entering life insurance markets

lnc s property casualty segment reported income from operations of million in  compared with previous year s earnings of million

study  
american states targets small to medium sized businesses engaged in retail  wholesale  service  contracting and other trades 
its commercial clients include relatively few manufacturing and industrial operations 
american states long term relationships with independent agencies are especially important in this market independent agencies dominate the distribution of commercial lines products to small to medium sized businesses 
automation edge american states  through interactive systems available in its agents offices  provides fully automated policy production and services in both personal and commercial lines 
the result it s easier and more economical for an agency to do business with american states 
the company uses knowledge based systems in its claims operation and is implementing knowledge based underwriting systems in its personal lines business 
american states also is developing knowledge based applications for selected commercial lines business 
the company s strides in automation are enabling it to consolidate offices and empower agents at the point of sale 
outlook fourth quarter net written premium at american states grew slightly from the same period in this gives a clear signal that the market impact of field office realignment is behind the company and may signify the end of a period of declining premiums 
american states is positioned to renew both unit and premium growth in a key element of this growth strategy is to leverage the company s strength in the commercial lines market 
personal lines products  such as life and private passenger auto insurance  will be marketed along with commercial lines coverage to owners of small to medium sized businesses 
american states  which operates in more than states  seeks to increase market share in its eight core states 
concurrently  it is concentrating additional resources to increase both market share and agency representation in states where the company believes its market position and favorable regulatory environments offer the potential for profitable growth

review of consolidated financial condition investments the investment portfolio  excluding cash and invested cash  is comprised of fixed maturity securities  equities  mortgage loans on real estate  real estate  either wholly owned or joint ventures  and other long term investments 
lnc purchases investments for its segmented portfolios with yield  duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported 
the total investment portfolio increased billion in this increase was the net result of decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale being more than offset by the new purchases of investments from cash flow generated by the business units 
lnc maintains a high quality fixed maturity securities portfolio 
as of december   billion or of its fixed maturity securities portfolio had ratings of aa or better 
only billion or had ratings below investment grade bb or less see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
the below investment grade fixed maturity securities represent only of lnc s total investment portfolio 
the interest rates available on these below investment grade securities are significantly higher than are available on other corporate debt securities 
also  the risk of loss due to default by the borrower is significantly greater with respect to such below investment grade securities because these securities are generally unsecured  often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer and issued by companies that usually have high levels of indebtedness 
lnc attempts to minimize the risks associated with these below investment grade securities by limiting the exposure to any one issuer and by closely monitoring the credit worthiness of such issuers 
for the year ended december   the aggregate cost of such investments purchased was billion 
aggregate proceeds from such investments sold were billion  resulting in a realized pre tax gain at the time of sale of million 
lnc s entire fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio is classified as available for sale and is carried at fair value 
changes in fair values  net of related deferred acquisition costs  amounts required to satisfy policyholder commitments and taxes are charged or credited directly to shareholders equity 
note to the consolidated financial statements see page shows the gross unrealized gains and losses as of december  lnc s fixed maturity securities available for sale include mortgage backed securities 
the mortgage backed securities included in lnc s investment portfolio are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments or delayed repayments 
this may result in these securities having a different actual cash flow and maturity than planned at the time of purchase 
securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss 
those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain 
repayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment or delayed repayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
lnc limits the extent of its risk on mortgage backed securities by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par  by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral  and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield but higher liquidity than higher risk mortgage backed securities 
at selected times  higher risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio 
at december   lnc did not have a significant amount of higher risk mortgage backed securities 
there are negligible default risks in the mortgage backed securities portfolio as a whole as the vast majority of the assets are either guaranteed by us government sponsored entities or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status 
see note to the consolidated financial statements on page for additional detail about the underlying collateral 
as of december   mortgage loans on real estate and investments in real estate represented and of the total investment portfolio 
as of december   the underlying properties supporting the mortgage loans on real estate consisted of in commercial office buildings  in retail stores  in apartments  in industrial buildings  in hotels motels and in other 
in addition to the dispersion by type of property  the mortgage loan portfolio is geographically diversified throughout the united states 
investment in unconsolidated affiliates this line was added to the balance sheet in following lnc s sale of of the ownership of its primary direct writer of employee life health coverages 
the minimal balance at december  and is due to the october sale of the remaining ownership in this company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements on page cash and invested cash cash and invested cash decreased by million in this decrease is the result of investing a portion of the operating cash flow that had previously been invested in short term investments pending the placement of funds in longer term investments 
deferred acquisition costs deferred acquisition costs increased million in a portion of this increase million was the result of a balance sheet reclassification between deferred acquisition costs and policy liabilities and accruals by lnc s united kingdom subsidiary 
this reclassification was made in order to more closely conform the united kingdom classifications to those used by lnc s us life operations 
the remainder of the increase is the result of the growth in business and increases related to the reduction in unrealized gain on securities available for sale during premiums and fees receivable premiums and fees receivable increased million in as the result of increased volume of business in the reinsurance segment 
assets held in separate accounts this asset account  as well as the corresponding liability account  increased by billion in as a result of increases in annuity and pension funds under management 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers the increase of million in amounts recoverable from reinsurers was the result of an increased volume of business ceded in the life insurance and annuities segment 
goodwill the decrease of million in this balance sheet account in represents the amortization for the year 
other intangible assets the million increase in this balance sheet account in is the net increase of additional amounts in intangible assets associated with lnc s purchase of a block of tax qualified annuity business see note to the consolidated financial statements on page  and the impact of the change in foreign currency adjustment less the impact of the amortization of existing amounts in other assets the decrease in other assets of million is the result of having a lower receivable related to investment securities sold in the last few days of versus the end of total liabilities total liabilities increased by billion in this increase reflects an increase in business activity as evidenced by an increase in policy liabilities and accruals of million this increase was partially offset by the reclassification discussed above under the deferred acquisition cost heading  an increase of billion in contractholder funds and an increase of billion in the liabilities related to separate accounts and  an increase in minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries of million see note to the consolidated financial statements on page  being partially offset by decreases in debt of million and a net decrease in all other liabilities of million 
the property casualty liabilities for unpaid claims and claims expense were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
these liabilities include liabilities for environmental claims of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  these amounts include approximately million and million of reserve for claims that have been incurred but not reported  and approximately million and million of related claim expenses  respectively 
because of the limited coverages that have been written by lnc  these environmental claims represent only of lnc s total property casualty policy liabilities based on claim counts of direct business and less than of lnc s total policy liabilities 
paid environmental claims and claim expenses totaled approximately million in compared with approximately million in the percentages and amounts referenced above are at these levels due to lnc s concentration on writing coverages for small to medium size companies rather than the larger companies that tend to incur most of the environmental and product liability claims 
lnc s management challenges environmental claims in cases of questionable liability and reviews the level of the environmental liabilities on an on going basis to help ensure that the liability maintained is adequate 
nonetheless  establishing liabilities for environmental claims is subject to significant uncertainties because of the long reporting delays  lack of historical data and the complexity of unresolved legal and regulatory issues see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
while it is management s judgment that  based on available information  the appropriate level of liabilities have been recorded  it is reasonably possible that a change in the estimate of the liability required could occur in the near term 
in addition to liabilities for environmental claims  lnc has other areas where changes in estimates of related liabilities required could occur in the near term 
these areas include claims for disability income coverages  liabilities and recoveries related to inappropriate selling of pension products in the united kingdom  liabilities for marketing and compliance issues and the reserve for the run off of group pension annuities see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
the increase in other liabilities relates to an increase in the expected payouts for security investments purchased in the last few days of versus a lower volume of such transactions late in minority interest preferred securities of subsidiary companies this line was added to the balance sheet following the financing activity described within the liquidity and cash flow section on page shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million during the year ended december  excluding the decrease of million related to a decline in the unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale  shareholders equity increased million 
this increase in shareholders equity was the net result of increases due to million of net income  million from the gain on sale of a minority interest in a subsidiary  million from the issuance of common stock related to benefit plans  million related to an increase in the accumulated foreign exchange gain and decreases of million related to the declaration of dividends to shareholders and million for the retirement of common stock 
capital adequacy is a primary measure used by insurance regulators to determine the financial stability of an insurance company 
in the us  risk based capital guidelines are used by the national association of insurance commissioners to determine the amount of capital that represents minimum acceptable operating amounts related to insurance and investment risks 
regulatory action is triggered when an insurer s statutory basis capital falls below the formula produced capital level 
at december   statutory basis capital for each of lnc s us life and property casualty insurance subsidiaries was substantially in excess of regulatory action levels of risk based capital required by the jurisdiction of domicile except for one property casualty company 
this company is servicing a closed block of business and therefore operates at minimum capital levels 
as noted above  shareholders equity includes net unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale 
at december   the book value of per share included of unrealized gains on securities and at december   the book value of per share included of unrealized gains on securities 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments that support long term life insurance  pension and annuity contracts are expected to be applied to contract benefits 
these realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in net income and shareholders equity  respectively 
current accounting standards do not require or permit adjustment of policyholder reserves to recognize the full effect of these realized and unrealized gains or losses on future benefit payments in the absence of a contractual obligation requiring their attribution to policyholders 
market risk exposures of financial instruments lnc analyzes and manages the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments  as well as other risks  in an integrated asset liability management process that takes diversification into account 
by aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks of the entire enterprise  lnc estimates and manages the risk to its earnings and shareholder value 
the risks of market exposures of financial instruments  and the related risk management processes  are most important in the life insurance and annuities segment 
this segment is where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment oriented insurance products 
as an important element of its integrated asset liability management process  lnc uses derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest rate levels and the shape of the yield curve 
in this context  derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to reduce interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of interest rate changes on lnc s stream of earnings 
additional market exposures exist in lnc s other general account insurance products and in its debt structure and derivatives positions 
the primary sources of market risk are substantial  relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates  a period of greater than normal default experience and  a sharp drop in equity market values  as discussed below 
specific market risk exposures as they relate to derivatives are included in the derivatives section of management s discussion and analysis on page accumulation and investment oriented insurance products 
general account assets supporting accumulation and investment oriented insurance products total billion or of total invested assets 
with respect to these products  lnc seeks to earn a stable and profitable spread between investment income and interest credited to account values 
if lnc has adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed through to customers  its spreads are reduced 
the interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial  relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period 
assets of billion supports the biggest category of accumulation and investment oriented insurance products  fixed deferred annuities 
for these products  lnc may adjust renewal crediting rates monthly or annually  subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from to 
the higher minimums apply to in force blocks of older products that no longer are sold 
lnc has billion in assets supporting universal life insurance on which it has the right to adjust renewal crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from to at december  annuity and universal life insurance customers have the right to surrender their policies at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from to years from policy issue date or  in some cases  the date of each premium received 
lnc also has assets totaling billion that support guaranteed interest contracts  pension buy out annuities and immediate annuities 
generally  the cash flows expected on these liabilities do not vary with fluctuations in market interest rates and are not adjustable by lnc 
accordingly  if experience on the assets supporting these products is more adverse than the assumptions used in pricing the products  spreads will tend to be below expectations 
lnc limits exposure to interest rate risk by managing the duration and maturity structure of each investment portfolio in relation to the liabilities it supports 
other general account insurance products 
lnc also has billion of assets supporting general account products  including disability income  property casualty insurance and term life insurance 
for these products  the liability cash flows may have actuarial uncertainty 
however  their amounts and timing do not vary significantly with interest rates 
lnc limits interest rate risk by analyzing the duration of the projected cash flows and structuring investment portfolios with similar durations 
debt 
lnc has short term and long term debt of which million is at fixed rates and million is at floating rates 
lnc manages the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise 
interest rate risk falling rates 
after rising in  interest rates fell in and rose again in for example  the five year treasury yield rose from to during and fell back to at the end of and increased to by the end of under scenarios in which interest rates fall and remain at levels significantly lower than those prevailing at december   minimum guarantees on annuity and universal life insurance policies could cause spreads to deteriorate 
select contracts that specify these minimum guarantees can be amended periodically to reflect current interest rate conditions 
the earned rate on the annuity and universal life insurance portfolios averaged and  respectively  for the year ended december   providing a cushion for further decline before the earned rates would be insufficient to cover minimum guaranteed rates plus the target spread 
the maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of this cushion for a period of time 
however  spreads would be at risk if interest rates continued to fall and remained lower for a long period 
lnc manages these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting its exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio 
lnc believes that the portfolios supporting its accumulation and investment oriented insurance products have a prudent degree of call protection in each category of liability and on a consolidated basis 
the mortgage backed securities mbs portion of the portfolio  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  represents a total of billion or of the billion of general account assets supporting such products 
lnc s mbs portfolio has better call protection than the mbs pass through market in general 
this is because of its concentration in protected amortization class cmos 
interest rate risk rising rates 
for both annuities and universal life insurance  a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders 
the portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to years or more 
accordingly  the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
as rates rise  the lag may be increased by slowing mbs prepayments 
the greater and faster the rise in interest rates  the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates 
if lnc sets renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread  the gap between its renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders 
if lnc credits more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders  its spreads will narrow 
lnc devotes extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions see derivatives section of management s discussion and analysis on page 
with this hedge  the potential adverse impact of a sustained rise in rates is kept within corporate risk tolerances 
lnc believes that the risks of rising interest rates are also mitigated by its emphasis on periodic premium products 
default risk 
in assessing the risk that the rate of default losses for each category of asset may be higher than the rates assumed in pricing its products  lnc considers the entire billion portfolio of invested assets  taking diversification into account 
of this total  billion consists of corporate bonds and billion consists of commercial mortgages 
lnc manages the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards  prudently limiting allocations to lower quality  higher yielding investments  and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and property type 
for each counter party or borrowing entity and its affiliates  lnc s exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality and industry group 
lnc remains exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
equity market exposures 
at december   lnc owned equities consisting of million of common stocks  million of real estate and million of other equity interests 
while lnc invests in these categories with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in its core fixed income investments  the returns on  and values of  these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than its fixed income investments 
the fee revenues of lnc s investment management segment and fees earned from variable annuities are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values 
investment advisory fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management 
in a severe equity market decline  fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals 
such withdrawals from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to lnc s fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to lnc by its competitors customers 
derivatives as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements see page  lnc has entered into derivative transactions to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity us government obligations  foreign exchange risk and fluctuations in financial times stock exchange ftse index 
a discussion of lnc s seven significant programs using derivative agreements and contracts follows 
six programs are used within the life insurance and annuities segment and the reinsurance segment 
the seventh program relates to foreign exchange risk on an investment in a foreign subsidiary is used within other operations 
lnc uses interest rate cap agreements to hedge against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates 
interest rate caps are contracts that require counterparties to pay lnc at specified future dates the amount  if any  by which a specified market interest rate exceeds the cap rate stated in the agreements  applied to a notional amount 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of billion with cap rates ranging from to basis points above prevailing interest rates 
these agreements expire in the cap rates in some contracts increase over time 
lnc also uses swaptions to hedge against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates 
swaptions are options to enter into a swap at a specified future date 
at expiration  the option is either settled in cash or exercised into a swap agreement 
lnc purchases swaptions to be settled in cash 
at expiration  the counterparty is required to pay lnc the amount  if any  of the present value of the difference between the fixed rate on a market rate swap and the strike  applied to a notional amount 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of million with strike rates ranging from to basis points above prevailing interest rates 
these agreements expire in for future periods the fair value of lnc s interest rate caps and swaptions depends on the levels of interest rates on us treasury securities with maturities of two  five  seven and years and us dollar swap rates with five  seven and year maturities 
the table below analyzes fair value levels at december  and for the next five years if the rates were    or higher than they were at december  in relation to the level of these rates at december   the cap and swaption rates were from to out of the money  ie  higher 
fair value levels of interest rate caps and swaptions under these scenarios are as follows year ended december in millions no change 

up 
up up up lnc periodically uses spread lock agreements to hedge a portion of the value of its fixed maturity securities against the risk of widening in the spreads between their yields and the yields of comparable maturity us government obligations 
the actual risk being hedged by these agreements is the potential widening of bond spreads that would be caused by widening swap spreads 
under these agreements  lnc assumed the right and the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap at a future date in which lnc would pay a fixed rate equal to a contractually specified spread over the yield of a specified us treasury security and receive a floating rate 
as of december   lnc did not have any open spread lock agreements 
lnc uses exchange traded financial futures contracts and options on financial futures to hedge against interest rate risks and to manage duration of a portion of its fixed maturity securities 
financial futures contracts obligate lnc to buy or sell a financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price 
they may be settled in cash or through delivery of the financial instrument 
cash settlements on the change in market values of financial futures contracts are made daily 
put options on a financial futures contract give lnc the right  but not the obligation  to assume a long or short position in the underlying futures contract at a specified price during a specified time period 
at december   lnc had long positions in the march ten year note futures with an aggregate face amount of million 
as the yields on the underlying treasury securities rise fall  the value of these long positions to lnc will decrease increase by approximately 
million for each basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
lnc uses over the counter otc call options to hedge against the increase of the ftse index 
these call options require the counterparties to pay lnc at specified future expiration dates the amount  if any  of the percentage increase in the ftse index over the strike price defined in the contract  applied to a notional amount 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of million 
these options expire in lnc uses a combination of foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign currency options  and foreign currency swaps to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to its investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies 
the foreign currency forward contracts obligate lnc to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date at a specified exchange rate 
as of december   lnc had a short position in foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional amount of million 
foreign currency options give lnc the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell a foreign currency at a specific exchange rate during a specified time period 
at december   lnc had long and short positions in foreign currency options with notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
a foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange the currencies of two different countries pursuant to an agreement to re exchange the two currencies at the same rate of exchange at a specified future date 
as of december   lnc had a foreign currency swap with a notional amount of million 
the values of the foreign exchange contracts  foreign currency options and foreign currency swaps  which are used to reduce the risk of reduction of the value in us dollars of investments denominated in foreign currencies that might result from an adverse change in currency exchange rates  fluctuate according to the underlying level of exchange rates 
at december   lnc had notional amounts of contracts in place of million 
if the us dollar were to appreciate depreciate in relation to each of the currencies involved in these contracts  the value of these positions would rise fall by million 
lnc periodically uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against foreign exchange risk related to lnc s investment in its british subsidiary  lincoln national uk 
the foreign exchange forward contracts obligate lnc to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date at a specified exchange rate 
the value of the foreign exchange forward contracts at any given point fluctuates according to the underlying level of exchange rate and interest rate differentials 
at december   lnc did not have any open foreign exchange forward contracts related to its investment in subsidiary companies 
the first five programs discussed above are designed to help lnc achieve more stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to policyholders during periods when interest rates are rising  corporate bond spreads are widening or the ftse index is rising 
failure to maintain competitive crediting rates could cause policyholders to withdraw their funds and place them in more competitive products 
the other two programs discussed above are designed to reduce lnc s risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
lnc is depending on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under interest rate cap agreements and other over the counter derivative products such as swaptions  spread lock agreements  foreign currency exchange contracts  foreign currency options  foreign currency swaps and call options 
in order to minimize the risk of default losses  lnc diversifies its exposures among several dealers and limits the amount of exposure in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor 
lnc generally limits its selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an a credit rating or above 
in addition to continuing existing programs  lnc may use derivative products in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns  particularly in the management of investment spread businesses 
lnc has established policies  guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in lnc s operations 
liquidity and cash flow liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety 
because of the interval of time from receipt of a deposit or premium until payment of benefits or claims  lnc and other insurers employ investment portfolios as an integral element of operations 
by segmenting its investment portfolios along product lines  lnc enhances the focus and discipline it can apply to managing the liquidity as well as the interest rate and credit risk of each portfolio commensurate with the profile of the liabilities 
for example  portfolios backing products with less certain cash flows and or withdrawal provisions are kept more liquid than portfolios backing products with more predictable cash flows 
the consolidated statements of cash flows on page indicate that operating activities provided cash of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
this statement also classifies the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities and financing activities and discloses the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet lnc s obligations 
although lnc generates adequate cash flow to meet the needs of its normal operations  periodically lnc may issue debt or equity securities to fund internal expansion  acquisitions  investment opportunities and the retirement of lnc s debt and equity 
as of december  lnc has a shelf registration with an unused balance of million that would allow lnc to issue debt or equity securities 
in  lnc filed another shelf registration for million which included the right to offer various forms of hybrid securities 
these securities  which have a combination of both debt and equity characteristics  utilize a series of three newly formed trusts 
all of these trusts common securities are owned by lnc lincoln national capital i  ii and iii 
as of december   lnc had an unused balance of million related to this hybrid security registration 
cash funds also are available from lnc s revolving credit agreement  which provides for borrowing up to million see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
recent transactions such as those described in the preceding paragraph include lnc s purchase and retirement of  shares of common stock at a cost of million in the fourth quarter of after deducting these shares  the current board authorization would allow the repurchase of an additional  shares of common stock 
also  lnc issued million  quarterly income preferred securities quips in july of and million  trust originated preferred securities toprs in august of both issues mature in callable in 
these securities are shown on the accompanying balance sheet between the liability and shareholders equity sections 
proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
another transaction which occurred in was the sale of of the principal subsidiary within the property casualty segment 
this transaction was completed in the form of an initial public offering of common stock 
the net cash proceeds after expenses from the sale of common stock in this subsidiary of million is being used to support the capital base of the property casualty operations and to meet working capital needs of the related holding company 
in conjunction with this offering  this subsidiary issued million of term debt payable to lnc plus million  debt due in also  prior to closing the sale  this subsidiary made a one time  special dividend distribution of million to lnc 
this dividend distribution consisted primarily of tax exempt municipal securities that were previously in the subsidiary s investment portfolio 
following the completion of the transaction  this subsidiary adopted a policy of declaring regular quarterly cash dividends  commencing with 
per share in the third quarter of as of december   lnc owns  of the  outstanding shares of this subsidiary
