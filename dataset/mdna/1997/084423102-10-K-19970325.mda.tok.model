item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry overview the demand for insurance can be characterized as fairly stable and is influenced primarily by general economic conditions  while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity  ie  the level of policyholders surplus employed in the industry and the willingness of insurance management to risk that capital 
in general  it is believed that the amount of available capacity changes as the perceived rate of return on capital employed fluctuates based on the adequacy of premium rates and available investment returns 
the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims which are influenced by many factors including natural disasters  regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses 
in addition  investment rates of return may impact policy rates 
these factors can have a significant impact on the ultimate adequacy of premium rates because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known  as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported
