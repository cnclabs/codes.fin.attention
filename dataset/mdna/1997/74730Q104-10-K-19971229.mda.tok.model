item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for ease of presentation  the company has indicated its fiscal year as ending on september  whereas  in fact  the company reports on a week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in september 
fiscal  which ended on september   and fiscal  which ended on september   each included weeks 
fiscal  which ended on september   included weeks 
the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales year ended september  net sales gross margin engineering  research and development selling and marketing administrative and general income from operations income before income taxes net income net sales 
the company derives net sales from the sale of its assembly products and peripherals  screen printers  reflow ovens  the resale of products manufactured by third parties and services 
sales are recorded upon shipment of products configured to meet customer application requirements 
net sales increased  or in and  or in over net sales in the respective preceding years 
the increase in net sales in was primarily attributable to commencement of sales of newly introduced products and to increased sales of recently introduced products 
net sales for included  of sales for the qsv assembler  the qsa assembler and the aps assembler  for which no sales were recognized during the prior year 
additionally  net sales of products first introduced in contributed an incremental  to net sales in sales of the q series of products  excluding the q and qsa  which do not incorporate q soft software  represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
the increase of the q series to of net sales primarily reflects commencement of shipment of the qsv assembler 
sales of the c series of products represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
the company believes that sales of the c series will continue to decrease 
net sales also included increased sales of screen printers and reflow ovens as sales under quadline have continued to expand 
quadline is the company s marketing program offering the major elements of smt production lines on a turnkey basis  including assemblers  screen printers and reflow ovens 
during and  sales of such systems accounted for approximately and of net sales  respectively 
the company continues to experience international growth 
the company derives its international sales from two wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in england that both manufacture and sell products  as well as from international sales shipped from its us operations 
international sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
international sales accounted for  and of the company s net sales for the years  and  respectively 
the company believes that international sales will continue to be a significant percentage of net sales 
in  net sales increased  or over the growth in net sales during was primarily due to the inclusion in sales for a full year of the qsp assembler and commencement of sales of the avx screen printer  the qsx assembler and the profile series of reflow ovens 
sales of q series products represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
the increase in q series sales reflected increased market penetration and market acceptance of the qsp and  as previously noted  commencement of shipment of the qsx sales of the c series of products represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
the company believes that the decrease in sales of the c series was due to sales of the qsp product and increased competition 
sales also included increased sales of screen printers as was the first full year of inclusion of sales from smtech limited  which was acquired in early in addition  sales of screen printers and reflow ovens also increased as sales under quadline expanded 
sales results for any particular year may not be indicative of results for future years 
the rate of technological change in the smt industry  including advances in component packaging  device design technologies and required software development  together with intense competition  represent continuous pressures on the company 
the company believes that the smt industry is entering the initial stages of a transition period with respect to certain aspects of the technology and marketing of smt products  with a focus on advanced packaging technology 
failure by the company to successfully respond in a timely fashion to such changes and competition or to customers requirements  with enhanced products and marketing  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in responding to such changes or in meeting such requirements 
in addition  the nature and extent of such changes and requirements and the company s ability to respond to such changes and requirements cannot be predicted 
with respect to the company s near term expectations  order bookings activity to date in the first quarter of fiscal has been below prior expectations 
this rate of order bookings could adversely affect net sales and gross margins as competition increases for those orders 
gross margin 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in and decreased to in the fourth quarter of from in the third quarter of gross profit during these comparative periods was negatively affected by lower margins in all major product lines as a result of competitive pricing pressures and from commencement of sales of the qsa  which contributes lower margins as a result of it being manufactured by a third party 
gross margin for was also adversely affected by a continuing shift in product mix from the c series to the q series 
the company expects that competitive pressures and product mix will cause gross margin for the first half of fiscal to decline further from the level achieved in the fourth quarter of however  the company believes that if it is successful in increasing sales of the recently introduced aps assembler  which is expected to have higher margins  and also achieves success in the second half of with other new products and product enhancements  gross margin improvement could commence during the second half of fiscal there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in these efforts  especially in view of the rate of technological change and issues that ordinarily arise in the introduction of a new advanced technology product 
several aps systems have been sold and installed at various locations throughout the world 
customer applications including flip chip and chip on board processes are currently meeting customer expectations 
however  one specific application for chip scale packaging  which required adding heat to the bond head  has not met customer requirements  and accordingly  the customer has returned this system to quad for additional testing  analysis and redesign 
in  gross margin increased to from in gross margin improved as a result of higher margins from sales of the c series  screen printers and the absence of a provision for product returns and allowances relating to the q series  partially off set by lower margins on the q series 
the company believes that the c series gross margin improvement was due to fewer sales of higher discounted multiple headed c series products 
gross margins on screen printer sales also improved as the company was no longer a reseller of screen printers subsequent to the acquisition of smtech 
q series gross margins decreased as a result of expanded sales to contract manufacturers  which in turn resulted in lower average selling prices  and with low margins on the then recently introduced qsx engineering  research and development expenses 
engineering  research and development expenses increased  or in over due to increased spending to support product development activities related to the aps assembler  a new screen printer to be introduced in and continuing enhancements to the profile series of reflow ovens 
the aps assembler is an advanced packaging assembler product that is being developed to meet new market opportunities taking place in semiconductor packaging technologies  such as chip scale packaging and flip chip assembly 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully market and sell the aps assembler 
during  engineering  research and development expenses increased  and were higher than the preceding year  supporting product development activities related to an expanded q series product line  the avx screen printer and the new profile series of reflow ovens 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or in as compared to last year 
this increase was primarily due to expenses associated with higher sales volume  higher commission rates associated with changes to the company s sales incentive programs  increased promotion and trade show costs and higher field service customer support costs 
during  selling and marketing expenses increased  or compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to expenses associated with higher sales volume  higher advertising and trade show costs  a change in the company s sales and service management structure  increased hiring of personnel in support of international sales and higher spending in support of customer demonstrations 
administrative and general expenses 
administrative and general expenses increased  or over last year  primarily reflecting an increased provision for doubtful accounts associated with a higher accounts receivable balance partially attributable to timing of sales within the fourth quarter of fiscal in  administrative and general expenses increased  or over the preceding year reflecting increased employee compensation  a full year of expenses after the acquisition of smtech  costs incurred in connection with the company s planned relocation and consolidation to a new operating and manufacturing facility  increased operating costs associated with the expansion of smtech into larger facilities and legal costs associated with the patent litigation discussed below 
income tax expense 
the company s effective income tax rate was  amounting to  in   amounting to  in and  amounting to  in income tax expense differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory tax rate to pretax income primarily due to permanent differences in taxable income versus book income  partially offset by benefits realized from the company s foreign sales corporation 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally due to a non recurring benefit from research and development tax credit claims associated with prior years 
the company expects an effective tax rate in the range for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital increased to million as of september   including cash balances of million  compared to working capital of million as of september   including cash balances of million 
the most significant change to working capital from the prior year was an increase in accounts receivable of million financed principally by million of incremental borrowings under the company s unsecured revolving line of credit 
the primary reason for the increase in accounts receivable was the timing of sales within the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period last year 
the company has a revolving line of credit agreement which permits borrowings up to a maximum of  and bears interest at the bank s base rate of interest as of september  or at the company s option  the bank s prime rate or libor plus when the outstanding balance is greater than  this line of credit is secured by a pledge by the company s united kingdom holding company  quad systems holdings limited  of of the outstanding shares of its two wholly owned united kingdom operating subsidiaries 
the company pays a fee of 
on the unused portion of the line of credit 
this credit agreement expires in april the line of credit agreement restricts the payment or declaration of any dividends on an annual basis in excess of of such year s pre tax income 
this line of credit agreement also contains various operating and reporting covenants and requires maintenance of certain financial ratios 
as of september   total borrowings under this line of credit were  prior to april  the company had a revolving line of credit that permitted borrowings up to a maximum of  with similar terms as in the  credit agreement 
subsequent to september   the company obtained an increase to its existing line of credit whereby an additional  is available 
this  increase expires on april  the company invested  in equipment and leasehold improvements in as compared to  in and  in during january  the company relocated its corporate headquarters and us manufacturing facility to a leased facility in willow grove  pennsylvania 
this new facility is being leased for a period of ten years and provides the company with additional capacity to allow for continued growth and the opportunity for increased efficiencies in its manufacturing operations 
capital spending for included significant costs associated with site preparation and internal furnishings for the new facility in addition to significant expenditures supporting upgrades to computer hardware and software 
most of these expenditures are not expected to repeat next year  and therefore  the company expects that capital additions will be lower than the level  although there can be no assurance that the company will achieve this objective 
in  the company obtained a  term loan to finance the acquisition of smtech 
during  the company obtained a new  term loan  the proceeds of which were used to pay off the outstanding balance of the then existing term loan in the amount of  and to finance leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures purchased in connection with the company s move to the new facility noted above 
the company believes that existing cash balances and borrowing capacity will be sufficient for the company to meet its working capital needs through fiscal backlog backlog of orders as of september   totaled million compared to million as of september  backlog includes million of assemblers  million of screen printers and 
million of reflow ovens compared with million of assemblers  million of screen printers and million of reflow ovens as of september  the remainder of backlog consists of other products 
the company expects to ship all backlog orders outstanding at september  during fiscal it has been the company s experience that purchasers of capital equipment have not issued purchase orders calling for delivery of products over an extended period 
therefore  backlog may not necessarily be indicative of future sales

in june  the company reached an agreement with samsung for the supply of component tape feeders 
under the terms of this agreement  the company granted an exclusive license subject to certain exceptions in favor of the company to samsung for samsung to become the company s sole supplier of component tape feeders  which are currently used on all of the company s placement systems 
the contract covers a six year period and requires quad to purchase a minimum of  component tape feeders with the value of at least million during the first two years of the contract  although samsung s remedy if this target is not met is to terminate the agreement 
the number of tape feeders to be purchased during the remainder of the contract term will be negotiated 
samsung is required to pay to quad a total of  representing a combination of licensing fees and a reimbursement for expenses incurred in transferring the company s technology to samsung for use in the production of the component tape feeders 
the company expects samsung to begin to supply component tape feeders to the company during fiscal patent infringement lawsuit in july  the company was named a defendant in a patent infringement lawsuit filed by the zevatech group in the federal district court in munich  germany 
the complaint alleges that the company infringed on the plaintiff s german patents relating to pick and place assemblers 
the company has responded with an action against the plaintiff in munich  germany seeking to have such plaintiff s patents invalidated 
management believes the lawsuit to be without merit or the company has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit 
accordingly  no provision for this lawsuit has been recorded during or settlement of securities litigation in march  a shareholder of the company filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania the action against the company  two of its executive officers and two of its directors one of which was also sued as an executive officer alleging that  during the period december  through march   the defendants knowingly or recklessly misrepresented or omitted material information about the company  its prospects and earnings  and knowingly or recklessly misrepresented or omitted information about the status and operation of certain software used in the company s products in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and common law 
during the year ended september   the company  to avoid the uncertainties of litigation and without admitting any wrongdoing of any of the claims alleged in the action  entered into a final settlement agreement and related documents  which has received court approval 
under this agreement  the company  together with its directors and officers liability insurer  paid an aggregate of  in settlement of all claims 
total cost including legal fees to the company  net of the amount paid by such insurer  was  impact of year software issues the company believes that the advent of the year will not cause material issues in regard to either its internal business operating systems or its internal engineering research and development systems 
however  the company has not determined the impact  if any  on software that either is currently being or previously was provided to its customers 
accordingly  the company is undertaking a study to determine the extent  if any  that software currently or previously supplied by the company needs to be modified to accommodate customer requirements 
the cost of this study and any resulting modifications required  if any  can not be reasonably estimated at this time but may be material 
the company also plans to initiate formal communications with all of its significant suppliers in an effort to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to those third parties who fail to remediate their own year issues 
however  upon completion of this project  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted  or that such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company 
forward looking statements the discussions above regarding the company s expectations of future sales  gross margins  operating expenses  facilities relocation  scheduling of new product introductions  quote activity  order bookings  expected shipment dates  and supply of tape feeders and assemblers manufactured by a third party include certain forward looking statements on these subjects 
as such  actual results may vary materially from such expectations 
among the meaningful factors that may affect the realization of such expectations are variations in the level of order bookings  which can be affected by general economic conditions and growth rates in the smt manufacturing industry and the intensity of competition  product development delays or performance problems or difficulties in penetrating the advanced packaging market  difficulties or delays in software functionality and performance  the timing of future software releases  failure to respond adequately either to changes in technology or to customer preferences  failures in the source of supply for tape feeders or assemblers manufactured by a third party  failure to successfully defend itself against the patent infringement litigation  risks of nonpayment of accounts receivable or changes in forecasted costs  including unexpected required additional engineering costs
