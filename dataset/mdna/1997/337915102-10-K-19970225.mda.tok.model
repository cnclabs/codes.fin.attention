the review highlights the principal factors affecting earnings and the significant changes in balance sheet items for the years  and financial information for prior years is presented when appropriate 
the objective of this financial review is to enhance the reader s understanding of the accompanying tables and charts  the consolidated financial statements  notes to financial statements  and financial statistics appearing elsewhere in this report 
where applicable  this discussion also reflects management s insights of known events and trends that have or may reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the corporation s operations and financial condition 
all financial data has been restated to give effect to acquisitions accounted for on a pooling of interests basis and stock splits in previous periods 
the results of other bank and branch acquisitions  accounted for as purchases  have been included effective with the respective dates of acquisition 
earnings summary firstmerit corporation s net income for totaled  or per share  compared with  or per share  earned in the savings association insurance fund saif recapitalization charge of  recorded september   had a significant impact on earnings 
excluding the saif charge  earnings were  or per share 
net income for included several one time charges and an extraordinary gain 
without the one time charges  earnings would have been  or per share 
as reported last year end  net income contained expenses of  related to an early retirement program  costs of  associated with the acquisition of the civista corporation civista  an extraordinary gain of  from the sale of several apartment complexes acquired by the corporation in its acquisition of civista  and  of reengineering charges implemented to improve overall operating efficiencies  improve branch network productivity  and centralize operations 
the implementation of these programs contributed significantly to firstmerit s success 
return on average equity for the year was and return on average assets was  when the saif charge was not considered 
the comparable ratios for  excluding the prior year one time charges  were and  respectively 
for the quarter  return on equity was versus in and return on assets was compared to for the same period last year 
net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was  up from last year 
the improved net interest margin of compared to in was primarily responsible for the rise in net interest income 
other income for the year was  an increase of  or over the prior year 
included in other income were net proceeds of  from sales of affiliate branches and  from the sale of firstmerit bank  na in clearwater  florida 
higher trust income  service charges on depositors accounts  and credit card fees also contributed to the improvement in other income 
other expenses were  compared to  in included in the figure is the pretax saif assessment of  other expenses for included portions of the early retirement  civista acquisition  and reengineering charges totaling  on a pretax basis 
the efficiency ratio  excluding unusual charges in both years  was approximately in versus for the improvement in the efficiency ratio is directly attributable to the reengineering plan developed in that focused on improving overall efficiencies  improving branch network productivity  and centralizing operations 
during  the corporation recorded a provision for possible loan losses of  a ten percent reduction from last year s provision of  the provisions in both years address the continuing shift in firstmerit s loan portfolio from residential mortgages into commercial and consumer loans  which historically have higher loss rates 
nonperforming assets were of total loans and other real estate compared to one year ago 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans was at december  and at december  as reported in november  firstmerit increased its regular quarterly cash dividend from per share to per share 
in september  the corporation implemented its second share repurchase plan 
on a combined basis  the two plans authorize repurchase of up to  shares of firstmerit s outstanding common stock 
through december   approximately  shares have been repurchased in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
the following table summarizes the changes in earnings per share for and dollars changes in earnings per share net income for and  respectively increases decreases attributable to net interest income taxable equivalent provision for possible loan losses trust services service charges on deposit accounts credit card fees securities losses  net other income salaries and employee benefits net occupancy expense equipment expense other expenses charges related to civista acquisition extraordinary gain disposition of assets federal income taxes taxable equivalent net change in net income net income per share net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest and loan fee income on earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  is the principal source of earnings for the corporation 
throughout this discussion net interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest were subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
the following table shows the allocation to assets  the source of funding and their respective interest spreads 
average net earning interest interest assets spread income dollars in thousands interest bearing liabilities   non interest bearing liabilities and equity   average net earning interest interest assets spread income interest bearing liabilities   non interest bearing liabilities and equity   average net earning interest interest assets spread income interest bearing liabilities   non interest bearing liabilities and equity   yield on earning assets net interest income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase occurred because the decline in interest expense was greater than the reduction in interest income 
specifically  interest income fell million while interest expense decreased million  or 
interest income was lower than last year because earning assets fell or million 
sales of affiliate branches in markets where firstmerit did not hold a dominant market share  the sale of firstmerit bank  na in clearwater  florida and sales and maturities of investment securities contributed to the decline in assets 
the average yield on earning assets increased basis points from to during lower interest expense was due to fewer interest bearing liabilities and a reduced cost of funds 
also contributing to less interest expense was a shift in the composition of customer deposits as earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities and equity increased from in and in to in the following table provides an analysis of the effect of changes in interest rates and volumes on net interest income in and changes in net interest differential fully tax equivalent rate volume analysis years ended december  and and increase decrease in increase decrease in interest income expense interest income expense yield yield volume rate total volume rate total dollars in thousands interest income investment securities taxable      tax exempt     loans      federal funds sold   total interest income       interest expense interest on deposits demand interest bearing    savings      certificates and other time deposits      federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings       total interest expense       net interest income       note the rate volume variance has been allocated entirely to volume 
total interest income decreased by million in or compared to  which increased from the decrease resulted from a decline in earning assets that was partially offset by an improved earning asset yield 
sales and maturities of investment securities contributed million or to the total drop in average earning assets of million 
the basis point improvement in the earning asset yield  from to  was entirely due to higher rates earned on loans during a higher yield on loans contributed million more to interest income in when compared to the prior year 
the increased yield earned on loans was primarily due to a change in the loan portfolio mix from residential mortgages to higher yielding commercial and consumer loans 
lower yields on federal funds sold and investment securities resulted in million less interest income than the prior year 
interest expense decreased million or compared to last year  which increased compared to lower average savings and other borrowing balances lessened interest expense by million and million  respectively  and were responsible for of the total decline caused by fewer outstandings 
lower rates paid on all interest bearing liabilities resulted in a million decline in interest expense 
reduced rates paid on other borrowings lowered interest expense by million  or of the total drop in interest expense caused by decreased interest rates 
lower savings rates accounted for another million or of the decline in interest expense due to lower deposit yields 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
the net interest margin for was compared to in and in as mentioned earlier in this discussion  even though interest rates were lower in  the yield on earning assets increased due to a shift in firstmerit s loan portfolio toward higher yielding commercial and consumer loans 
the cost of funding the earning assets decreased basis points from in to in the combination of a higher yield on earning assets and a lower cost of funding boosted the corporation s net interest income and net interest margin significantly  and was principally responsible for the increases in both categories as earning assets declined during the year

service charges on deposits rose million or compared to last year 
contributing to the increase was the implementation of standard service charges and procedures among affiliate banks as well as changes to the deposit product lines 
service charges accounted for of total other income when net gains from sales of affiliate branches and firstmerit bank  na in clearwater  florida are excluded 
credit card fees increased million during further illustrating the shift of the corporation s loan portfolio from residential mortgage loans to consumer and commercial credits 
income from mortgage sales and servicing rose million  or  to million for the year 
the net increase was a result of implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights  which added million in  and fewer loan sales during the year  compared to  which lowered this category by approximately million 
the corporation s practice is to sell all fixed rate thirty year residential mortgage loans originated while retaining the servicing for these loans 
securities losses were million for compared to gains of million in the corporation sold certain securities at a loss  principally in the fourth quarter  to reinvest the proceeds into higher yielding assets for and future years

excluding these expenses  salaries  wages  pension and benefits were still million or less than the prior year s adjusted total 
the current year reduction was attributable to the actions taken in to reengineer the corporation s retail delivery systems and consolidate back room operations 
in  the corporation spent cents in benefits for every dollar of salary and wages compared to cents in  excluding the severance and early retirement charges  and cents in the corporation has a benefit plan which presently provides postretirement medical and life insurance for retired employees 
the corporation reserves the right to terminate or make additional plan changes at any time 
the corporation s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo as of january  totaled million  and is being amortized over twenty years at an annual cost of million 
professional services totaled million in compared to million in and million in in  external support groups were used to help develop the reengineering plan to improve operating efficiencies  increase revenues and shareholder value  and to help train our employees to effectively sell our new products and services 
on january   the fdic implemented a risk based assessment system for depository institutions 
under the system  the annual assessment rate for each insured institution is determined on the basis of both capital and supervisory measures  and can range from cents to cents per one hundred dollars of deposits 
during the third quarter of  the fdic reduced the effective rate of the annual assessment on bank insurance fund bif deposits to approximately cents per one hundred dollars of deposits 
as mentioned earlier in this section  the corporation s fdic assessment for included a one time recapitalization of the savings association insurance fund totaling million 
excluding the one time charge  fdic expense would have been million 
the adjusted expense of million is considerably less than the and amounts due to the reduction in the effective rate applicable to bank insurance fund bif deposits 
other operating expenses amounted to million in compared to million last year and million in included in costs were million of severance payments and fees paid to financial advisors as part of the civista acquisition as well as million of reengineering charges for the adjustment to the value of buildings  equipment and other assets 
federal income tax federal income tax expense totaled million in compared to million in  when tax expense of million associated with the extraordinary gain is included  and million in in the effective federal income tax rate for the corporation equaled compared to in and in the effective tax rate in was higher than normally seen due to the recapture of the bad debt reserve totaling approximately million  and the nondeductibility of certain professional fees associated with the civista acquisition 
investment securities the investment portfolio is maintained by the corporation to provide liquidity  earnings  and as a means of diversifying risk 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  securities are required to be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
all investment securities are currently classified as availablefor sale 
in this classification  adjustment to fair value of the securities available for sale in the form of unrealized holding gains and losses  is excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in a separate component of shareholders equity 
the adjustments to reduce fair value at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
higher interest rates at the end of accounted for the increase in the fair market adjustment 
at december   investment securities totaled  million compared with  million one year earlier  a decline of 
investment securities totaled  million at the end of during approximately million in securities were sold for which a net loss of million was realized 
the sales and resultant losses occurred as the corporation restructured portions of its investment portfolio 
a summary of investment securities carrying value is presented below as of december   and presented with the summary is a maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted average yields

loans total loans outstanding at december  decreased compared to one year ago or  million compared to  million 
a breakdown by category is presented below  along with a maturity summary of commercial  financial and agricultural loans 
december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural       installments to individuals       real estate       lease financing       total loans       less allowance for possible loan losses       net loans       december  commercial  financial and agricultural due in one year or less  due after one year but within five years  due after five years  total  loans due after one year with interest at a predetermined fixed rate  loans due after one year with interest at a floating rate  total  real estate loans at december  totaled  million or of total loans outstanding compared to one year ago 
residential loans family dwellings totaled million  home equity loans million  construction loans million and commercial real estate loans million 
the year end real estate totals point out the shift in the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio from residential real estate to higher yielding commercial and consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans include both commercial loans where real estate has been taken as collateral as well as loans for commercial real estate 
the majority of commercial real estate loans are to owner occupants where cash flow to service debt is derived from the occupying business cash flow instead of normal building rents 
these loans are generally part of an overall relationship with existing customers primarily within northeast ohio 
consumer loans or loans to individuals increased compared to last year and accounted for of total loans compared to in commercial  financial  and agricultural loans increased during and make up of total outstanding loans compared to last year 
again  the increase in consumer and commercial loans is evidence of firstmerit s shifting loan portfolio 
the decline in lease financing loans from million in to million at december  is primarily due to decreased originations in the highly competitive auto lease business 
auto leases totaled million with equipment leasing totaling million  and leveraged leases were million at year end there is no concentration of loans in any particular industry or group of industries 
most of the corporation s business activity is with customers located within the state of ohio 
asset quality making a loan to earn an interest spread inherently includes taking the risk of not getting repaid 
successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 
the corporation s credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiary banks  participating in approval of their largest loans  conducting reviews of their loan portfolios  providing them with centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing their loan workouts 
the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
effective december   the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and statement no 
 an amendment of statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
these statements prescribe how the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans should be determined and the required disclosures 
impaired loans are loans for which  based on current information or events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans must be valued based on the present value of the loans expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rates  at the loans observable market price  or the fair value of the loan collateral 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful 
restructured loans on which  due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition  the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven

s and impaired loans as defined by statements and exclude certain consumer loans  residential real estate loans  and leases classified as non accrual 
consumer installment loans are charged off when they reach days past due 
credit card loans are charged off when they reach days past due 
when any other loan becomes days past due  it is placed on non accrual status unless it is well secured and in the process of collection 
any losses are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses as soon as they are identified 
non performing assets at december  totaled million  down from million in and million in as a percentage of total loans outstanding plus oreo  non performing assets were at year end compared to in and in the average balances of impaired loans for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   impaired assets earned  in interest income 
had they not been impaired  they would have earned million 
for the same period  total non performing loans earned  in interest income 
had they paid in accordance with the payment terms in force prior to being considered impaired  on non accrual status  or restructured  they would have earned million 
in addition to non performing loans and loans days past due and still accruing interest  management identified potential problem loans totaling million at december  these loans are closely monitored for any further deterioration in the borrowers financial condition and for the borrowers ability to comply with terms of the loans 
allowance for possible loan losses the corporation maintains what management believes is an adequate allowance for possible loan losses 
the parent company and the subsidiary banks regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowances through ongoing reviews of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  non performing assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
at year end the corporation boosted its allowance for possible loan losses in response to the continuing shift of its portfolio out of residential mortgage loans and into commercial and consumer loans  which historically have exhibited higher loss rates 
during the year  consumer delinquencies continued at high levels and losses in the consumer portfolio were higher than in the recent past 
management felt it was prudent to increase the allowance at year end to ensure its adequacy for changes that have occurred and will continue to occur in the loan portfolio 
at december   the allowance was million or of loans outstanding compared to million or in and million or in the allowance equaled of non performing loans at december  compared to in the allowance for possible loan losses related to impaired loans at december  and december  totaled  and  respectively 
net charge offs were million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of average loans outstanding  net charge offs equaled in  in and in losses are charged against the allowances as soon as they are identified

sales of affiliate branches and their respective deposits  and the strength of the stock market during were factors in the overall decline in deposit balances 
the success of the corporation s free checking campaigns brought in additional demand deposits that partially offset the overall decline in deposits and contributed to an improved cost of funds and net interest margin 
as market interest rates decreased during the year  and the stock market strengthened  savings deposits were withdrawn and reinvested in equity funds not held by the corporation 
specifically  the decline in average savings deposits from  million in to  million in accounted for more than of the decline in total average deposits 
average demand deposits  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing categories  totaled  million for the year  an increase of over last year s average 
additionally  the average rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits decreased basis points to 
the combination of higher demand deposit balances and a lower yield contributed positively to the corporation s decrease in total cost of funds 
certificates and other time deposits cds averaged  million for  down less than one percent from s average of  million 
the average yield paid on cds declined basis points from in to in cds accounted for of average deposits in compared to in savings equaled and in and  respectively  and demand deposits  both interest and non interest bearing  were and  respectively

amount maturing in under months  to months  to months  over months  interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy which provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies to trends within the financial markets and within the industry 
the analysis presented below divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion which it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that liabilities maturing within one year exceed assets maturing within the same period by a moderate amount 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and other tools to monitor rate risk 
at december  the corporation was in a moderate asset sensitive position as illustrated in the following table over days days days days days year total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans and leases        investment securities        federal funds sold   total interest earning assets        interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing      savings      certificates and other time deposits        securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowings      total interest bearing liabilities        total gap        cumulative gap       capital resources shareholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december   a decrease of

the federal deposit insurance corporation act of fdicia set capital guidelines for a financial institution to be considered well capitalized 
these guidelines require a risk based capital ratio of  a tier i capital ratio of and a leverage ratio of 
at december   the corporation s risk based capital equaled of risk adjusted assets  its tier i capital ratio equaled and its leverage ratio equaled 
the corporation s board of directors declared a for split of the corporation s common stock on august  the split was paid to shareholders of record as of august  during  the corporation s directors increased the quarterly cash dividend  marking the fifteenth consecutive year of annual increases since the corporation s formation in the cash dividend of

over the past five years the dividend has increased at an annual rate of approximately 
liquidity the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its strong core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system  along with a strong capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
the banking subsidiaries individually maintain sufficient liquidity in the form of temporary investments and a short term maturity structure within the investment portfolio  along with cash flow from loan repayment 
asset growth in the banking subsidiaries is funded by the growth of core deposits 
reliance on borrowed funds decreased during the year as maturing investment portfolio securities were used to fund deposit withdrawals and repay borrowings 
during the year  the corporation sold  for liquidity purposes  approximately million of fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans 
the loan sales improved liquidity while restructuring the balance sheet to higher yielding assets 
the liquidity needs of the parent company  primarily cash dividends and other corporate purposes  are met through cash  short term investments and dividends from banking subsidiaries 
management is not aware of any trend or event  other than noted above  which will result in or that is reasonably likely to occur that would result in a material increase or decrease in the corporation s liquidity 
regulation and supervision a strict uniform system of capital based regulation of financial institutions became effective on december  under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category 
at december   the parent company and its subsidiaries all exceeded the minimum capital levels of the adequately capitalized category 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this annual report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes
