general reptron electronics  inc is an integrated electronics company operating as a distributor of electronic components and a contract manufacturer of electronic products 
reptron distribution has sales offices  located throughout the united states  which are supported from the corporate headquarters in tampa 
the tampa headquarters maintains centralized operations including corporate product marketing  component programming  mis  warehousing and division senior management 
each branch sales office is connected to the tampa headquarters electronically by computer data lines 
reptron distribution sales are recognized upon shipment 
net sales from reptron distribution to k byte manufacturing are eliminated for financial statement presentation 
cost of sales for reptron distribution includes only the costs of materials electronic components 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  sales commissions  fringe benefits  telephone  training  rent  insurance  travel  entertainment  and all other costs required to operate the division  including corporate overhead charges 
in  the company began implementing its current strategy of integrating contract manufacturing with electronics distribution with its acquisition of k byte manufacturing  which primarily offers contract manufacturing services to its customers on a turnkey basis pursuant to customer designs 
in turnkey contracts  k byte manufacturing purchases the electronic components and other material used in assembly and charges for these items in addition to its labor and manufacturing costs 
for strategic reasons  k byte manufacturing does not pursue consignment business  in which the customer supplies the product material and pays only for labor and manufacturing costs 
the company believes that by retaining total responsibility for material procurement it can achieve greater control of the manufacturing process and can leverage the strengths of reptron distribution 
k byte manufacturing s contracts with customers address the customer s obligations relative to cancellation  component price increases  engineering change notices  inventory stores  work in process and vendor stock and payment terms 
k byte manufacturing sales are recognized upon shipment 
cost of goods sold for k byte manufacturing includes the cost of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
k byte manufacturing s selling  general and administrative expenses include management and administrative salaries  travel  entertainment  office expenses and corporate overhead charges 
the company has centralized many of its operations  including finance  accounting  legal  credit and collections  mis  human resources and senior management 
these functions are performed by personnel in the corporate headquarters in tampa  who serve both divisions of the company 
certain economic and integration benefits are realized by centralizing these functions  and costs associated with these centralized functions are allocated to each division through corporate overhead charges 
additionally  each division can concentrate on its core business and focus on serving customers without being distracted by administrative issues 
the company believes that through this centralization it can better control overhead expenses and spread the costs of centralized functions over a larger sales base  that can expand as a result of internal growth and acquisitions 
management believes this centralization also helps the company in its continuous efforts to reduce overhead expenses relative to sales and thereby increase profitability

the company has entered into various capital lease transactions with several leasing companies to finance capital expenditures  primarily in k byte manufacturing 
these leases had an aggregate balance outstanding of million as of december  the leases bear interest at rates ranging from to and expire at various dates through december  the company s operating activities generated cash of approximately million in this increase in liquidity resulted primarily from net earnings of million  a million decrease in inventories  a million decrease in accounts receivable  and a million increase in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
these items were offset by a million decrease in accounts payable 
the decrease in inventory resulted primarily from an increase in reptron distribution s inventory turns from a fourth quarter average of times in to times in k byte manufacturing inventory turns decreased from a fourth quarter average of times in to times in the complex process associated with integrating ten new customers  representing over different circuit board assemblies  into the k byte manufacturing production process is the primary reason for the reduced inventory turns in the company s accounts receivable collections averaged days as of december  the company s capital expenditures  including capital leases  were approximately million in  million in and million in in  the company purchased its corporate headquarters building in tampa  florida and a acre parcel adjacent to its headquarters for construction of its manufacturing and warehouse facility see properties 
these items accounted for approximately million of the capital expenditures total 
in  the company added  square feet onto its k byte manufacturing facility in gaylord  michigan and initiated construction on a  square foot building adjacent to the corporate headquarters in tampa  florida 
this building will be used as the main warehouse for reptron distribution and the tampa k byte manufacturing facility 
these items accounted for approximately million of the capital expenditures total 
the continuing construction of the  square foot building accounted for approximately million of the capital expenditures 
reptron distribution warehouse equipment represented approximately  of the total capital expenditures 
the remainder of the capital expenditures in years through were primarily for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment for use in k byte manufacturing 
capital expenditures during the years through were funded through capital leases and bank financing 
in  the acquisitions of cronin electronics and the electronic components distribution business of western micro technology was financed through a combination of cash and assumption of specified liabilities 
of the approximately million and million total consideration  respectively  approximately million was in cash with the remainder in the form of assumption of specified liabilities 
the cash payment was funded by the bank credit line 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient for the company to meet its capital expenditures and working capital needs for its operations as presently conducted 
the company s future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including the level of business in existing operations  expansion of facilities and possible acquisitions 
in particular  if cash flow from operations and available credit facilities are not sufficient  the company will be required to seek additional financing 
while there can be no assurance that such financing would be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to the company  the company believes that such financing likely would be available on acceptable terms
