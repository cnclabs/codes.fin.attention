item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
solectron s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those factors set forth under trends and uncertainties below 
general solectron s net sales are derived from sales to electronics systems original equipment manufacturers oems 
the majority of solectron s customers compete in the networking and data communications  workstation  personal computer and computer peripheral segments of the electronics industry 
the company uses advanced manufacturing technologies in assembly and manufacturing management of complex printed circuit boards and electronics systems 
solectron also provides pre manufacturing and post manufacturing services 
a discussion of some of the potential fluctuations in operating results is included under trends and uncertainties 
on november   solectron exchanged approximately million shares of common stock for all of the outstanding stock of force computers  inc force  and assumed all of the outstanding options of force  after giving effect to the exchange ratio 
force is a designer and provider of computer platforms for the embedded market 
this transaction was accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
the results of operations of force prior to its acquisition were not considered material to the company s consolidated results of operations 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements have not been restated to reflect the financial position and results of operations of force  and pro forma financial information has not been disclosed 
as of august   excluding the locations of the force computers and fine pitch technologies subsidiaries  the company had manufacturing operations in eleven locations  six of which are overseas 
on april   the company announced its twelfth manufacturing location in guadalajara  mexico  which is expected to begin offering manufacturing services to oem customers in the first quarter of fiscal solectron has a sales support office located in japan and in september  opened its asia pacific headquarters office in taipei  taiwan 
force computers and fine pitch technologies are both headquartered in san jose  california 
force s european headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are located in munich  germany 
in addition to its headquarters locations  force has thirteen sales support offices in the united states and six sales support offices in various international locations 
fine pitch has operations in california and in massachusetts 
in march  the company announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with ericsson telecom ab s business area infocom systems ericsson to establish a strategic  global manufacturing partnership 
under the terms of the memorandum of understanding  the company will set up a new product introduction center in norrkoping and stockholm  sweden and transfer production from certain ericsson plants worldwide to solectron manufacturing sites around the world 
in july  solectron and ericsson signed definitive agreements upon completion of negotiations of the general terms and conditions for solectron s supply of certain products to ericsson  for the establishment of the new product introduction center and for the transfer of certain assets to solectron 
in october  solectron acquired certain assets  primarily equipment and inventory  of ericsson s printed circuit board assembly operation in brazil 
in addition  solectron s newly established subsidiary  solectron brasil ltda  hired approximately persons formerly employed by ericsson telecomunicacoes sa in brazil 
additional agreements related to the new product introduction center and the transfer of certain other assets are being negotiated 
these transactions are expected to undergo multiple closings through january  subject to the successful negotiation of additional definitive agreements and various closing conditions 
results of operations the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price competition 
these and other factors affecting the electronics industry  or any of solectron s major customers in particular  could have an adverse material effect on solectron s results of operations 
see trends and uncertainties potential fluctuations in operating results and competition for further discussion of potential fluctuations in operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended august  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development acquisition costs operating income net interest income expense income before income taxes income taxes net income net sales the company s net sales have increased significantly in each of the past several years  reflecting the growing trend toward outsourcing within the electronics industry 
for the year ended august   net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal net sales 
fiscal net sales of billion were greater than net sales in fiscal the fiscal sales growth is attributable to significant increases in sales volume from both existing and new customers in north america  higher international sales and the acquisitions of the custom manufacturing services cms business  located in austin  texas and force in march and november  respectively 
the sales increase in fiscal was due to increased orders from both new and existing customers at existing sites  the cms acquisition in march and the acquisition of the site now located in herrenberg  germany in november sales in the north american region reflected increases in sales at all locations to existing and new customers in fiscal compared to fiscal as well as in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall increase in sales in fiscal over fiscal was partially offset by the effect of several ongoing programs reaching end of life and deliberate management actions to achieve improved global load balancing as well as specific product program transitioning 
the growth in north american sales in fiscal over fiscal reflects the impact of the acquisitions of cms and fine pitch in march fiscal sales in most of the company s european operations increased over fiscal sales as a result of the global load balancing efforts noted above as well as higher sales to existing and new customers 
these increases were partially offset by declines in sales during fiscal from older programs in the bordeaux facility as these programs reach end of life 
fiscal sales in europe were lower than fiscal sales due to the same end of life issues in bordeaux and similar issues in the scotland facility 
fiscal sales for the company s asian sites increased over fiscal despite the impact of many of the same end of life factors as in europe 
the growth in asian sales in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects increased orders from new and existing customers in that region 
although the company does not currently anticipate any future decline in sales  to lessen the potential impact of any possible future declines to customers within any particular region or market segment  the company is committed to seeking diversification of its customer base among many countries  market segments and product lines within market segments 
several major customers accounted for more than of the company s net sales in fiscal  and in fiscal and  hewlett packard company hp was solectron s largest customer and accounted for and of consolidated net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
bay networks  inc accounted for of consolidated net sales in fiscal international business machines corporation ibm was solectron s largest customer during fiscal and accounted for of consolidated net sales in that year 
net sales to ibm in fiscal and were less than of consolidated net sales  reflecting both a decrease in actual sales volume to ibm and an overall increase in solectron s total consolidated net sales from all other customers 
no other customers accounted for more than of net sales during any of the years presented 
solectron s top ten customers accounted for  and of consolidated net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the lower percentage of sales attributable to the top ten customers over the three year period has resulted primarily from solectron s ability to obtain significant new business from other customers  thereby reducing its dependence on these accounts 
solectron is still dependent upon continued revenues from hp  bay networks and its other top ten customers and there can be no guarantee that these or any other customers will not increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could have an adverse material effect on solectron s results of operations 
net sales at solectron s international sites  as a whole  grew at a slower rate over the last three fiscal years than aggregate net sales at solectron s domestic sites 
international locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition to the end of life issues impacting international sales discussed above  the primary reason for the decrease in international sales as a percentage of total sales is strong growth in domestic sales  aided by the acquisition of the cms business in austin  texas  which is substantially comprised of domestic sales 
as a result of solectron s international sales and facilities  solectron s operations are subject to risks of doing business abroad 
while to date these dynamics have not had an adverse material effect on solectron s results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be such an impact in the future 
see trends and uncertainties international operations for a further discussion of potential fluctuations in operating results associated with the risks of doing business abroad 
solectron s operations in milpitas  california contributed a substantial portion of solectron s net sales and operating income during fiscal  and the performance of this operation is expected to continue as a significant factor in the overall financial performance of solectron 
any adverse material change to the customer base  product mix  efficiency  or other attributes of this site could have an adverse material effect on solectron s consolidated results of operations 
solectron believes that its ability to continue achieving growth will depend upon growth in sales to existing customers for their current and future product generations  successful marketing to new customers and future geographic expansion 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be assured 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of solectron s current customers will continue to utilize solectron s services 
because of these factors  there can be no assurance that solectron s historical revenue growth rate will continue 
see trends and uncertainties for a discussion of certain factors affecting the management of growth  geographic expansion and potential fluctuations in sales and results of operations 
gross profit the gross margin percentage improved to for fiscal from for fiscal and in fiscal the improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of force since its acquisition in november gross profit margins on force s products are significantly higher than those of the rest of the company 
without force s contribution  gross margins for fiscal would have been 
in addition to the impact of force  the improved gross margin percentage in fiscal reflects a shift in product mix toward the higher margin workstation and networking and data communications market segments  projects with a higher than normal consignment content and increased manufacturing efficiencies at the dunfermline  scotland and austin  texas sites 
for the foreseeable future  solectron s gross margin is expected to depend primarily on product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  start up and integration costs of new and acquired businesses  the percentage of sales derived from turnkey manufacturing and pricing within the electronics industry 
over time  gross margins at the individual sites and for the company as a whole may continue to fluctuate 
consignment projects typically have higher gross margin percentages than turnkey projects 
increases in turnkey business  additional costs associated with new projects and price erosion within the electronics industry could adversely affect the company s gross margin 
additionally  changes in product mix could cause the company s gross margin to fluctuate 
also  while the availability of raw materials appears adequate to meet the company s current revenue projections for the foreseeable future  component availability is still subject to lead time and other constraints that could possibly limit the company s revenue growth 
because of these factors and others discussed under trends and uncertainties below  there can be no assurance that the company s gross margin will not fluctuate or decrease in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal the inclusion of force since its acquisition in november and the austin  texas site for the full year of fiscal accounts for approximately half of the fiscal increase 
the remainder of the increase in fiscal and the fiscal increase over fiscal is due primarily to investment in infrastructure such as personnel and related departmental expenses at all manufacturing locations as well as continuing investment in information systems to support the increased size and complexity of the company s business 
the addition in fiscal and of new sites in malaysia johor  california fine pitch technologies  china  massachusetts and  most recently  mexico  has also contributed to the growth in sg a expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the most significant reasons for the fiscal increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales are the inclusion of force  which has a more sales intensive operating structure  the costs associated with investments in starting up new sites and investments in the company s information systems 
the company anticipates sg a expenses will continue to increase in terms of absolute dollars in the future  and may possibly increase as a percentage of revenue  as the company continues to build the infrastructure necessary to support its current and prospective business 
research and development expenses with the exception of its force computers operation  the company s research and development r d activities have been focused primarily on the development of prototype and engineering design capabilities  fine pitch interconnecting technologies which include ball grid array  tape automated bonding  multichip modules  chip on flex  chip on board and flip chip  high reliability environmental stress test technology and the implementation of environmentally friendly assembly processes  such as voc free and no clean 
force s r d efforts are concentrated on new product development and improvement of product designs through improvements in functionality and support of next generation microprocessors 
research and development expenses  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  respectively  were million and in fiscal  million and in fiscal and million and in fiscal the increase in r d expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the acquisition of force in november the company expects that r d expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future and may increase as a percentage of net sales as force continues to invest in its r d efforts and additional r d projects are undertaken at certain of the company s asian sites 
acquisition costs a one time charge for acquisition costs of approximately million was incurred as a result of the acquisition of force computers during the quarter ended november  net interest income expense net interest income was million in fiscal compared to net interest expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company issued convertible subordinated notes in february and senior notes in march interest expense on the debt is approximately million annually and  in fiscal  has been offset by interest earned on undeployed cash and investments 
net interest expense was lower in fiscal than in fiscal because the higher interest expense resulting from the two debt offerings was offset by higher interest income on the undeployed cash realized from the offerings 
solectron expects to utilize more of the undeployed cash during fiscal in order to fund anticipated future growth 
see trends and uncertainties management of growth and potential fluctuations in operating results 
income taxes income taxes increased to million in from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily due to increased income before income taxes 
solectron s effective income tax rate decreased slightly to in fiscal from in both fiscal and in general  the effective income tax rate is largely a function of the balance between income from domestic and international operations 
solectron s international operations  taken as a whole  have been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to the tax holiday granted to the company s penang  malaysia site 
the malaysian tax holiday is effective through january   subject to certain conditions 
the company has also been granted various tax holidays in china  which are effective for various terms and are subject to certain conditions 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at august  compared to million at the end of fiscal in fiscal  increases in working capital from cash generated from operations were augmented by working capital resulting from the acquisition of new sites 
a major component of working capital at august  continues to be undeployed cash from the proceeds of the two debt offerings during fiscal as solectron continues to grow  it is expected that the company will require greater amounts of working capital to support its operations 
the company believes that its current level of working capital  together with cash generated from operations and the company s available credit facilities  will provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
inventory levels fluctuate directly with the volume of the company s manufacturing 
changes or significant fluctuations in product market demands can cause fluctuations in inventory levels which may result in changes in levels of inventory turns and liquidity 
historically  the company has been able to manage its inventory levels with regard to these fluctuations 
however  should material fluctuations occur in product demand  the company could experience slower turns and reduced liquidity 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
the largest component of these expenditures related to the purchase of new equipment primarily surface mount assembly and test equipment to meet current and expected production levels  as well as to replace or upgrade older equipment that was retired or sold 
in addition  significant expenditures were made for the acquisition of land and buildings for the company s new manufacturing sites  principally in china and mexico 
the company expects capital expenditures in fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
in addition to working capital as of august   which included cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  the company has available a million unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility  subject to financial covenants 
the company also has approximately million in available foreign credit facilities 
in september  the company entered into a asset securitization arrangement  which is subject to certain financial covenants and management representations 
no borrowings have been made against this facility 
trends and uncertainties customer concentration  dependence on the electronics industry in fiscal  and  the company s ten largest customers accounted for at least of consolidated net sales 
the company is dependent upon continued revenues from its top ten customers 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from these or other significant customers could have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
during fiscal  hp and bay networks  inc accounted for and  respectively  of net sales  compared to and less than  respectively  during fiscal there can be no assurance that the company will continue to do business with hp  bay networks or any other customer 
the percentage of the company s sales to its major customers may fluctuate from period to period 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers would have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has no firm long term volume purchase commitments from its customers  and over the past few years has experienced reduced lead times in customer orders 
in addition  customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of canceled  delayed or reduced contracts with new business cannot be assured 
these risks are increased because a majority of the company s sales are to customers in the electronics industry  which is subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the factors affecting the electronics industry in general  or any of the company s major customers in particular  could have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that sales to customers within any particular market segment will not experience decreases that could have an adverse effect on the company s sales 
management of growth  geographic expansion the company has experienced substantial growth over the last five fiscal years  with net sales increasing from million in fiscal to billion in fiscal year in recent years  the company has acquired or established facilities in many locations 
during fiscal  the company announced the establishment of new manufacturing facilities in suzhou  china and guadalajara  mexico  began operations at its manufacturing facility in westborough  massachusetts  and  in november  acquired force computers inc  which has operations in california and germany 
in september  the company announced the opening of its asia pacific headquarters office in taipei  taiwan 
in addition  the company established a manufacturing facility near sao paolo  brazil  and intends to open a new product introduction center in sweden  as further discussed in pending acquisition of ericsson manufacturing operation and related transactions 
the company continually evaluates growth and acquisition opportunities and may pursue additional opportunities over time 
there can be no assurance that the company s historical revenue growth will continue or that the company will successfully manage the integration of force computers  the facilities in china and mexico  the partnership with and acquisitions from ericsson or any other business it may acquire in the future 
as the company manages its existing operations and expands geographically  it may experience certain inefficiencies as it integrates new operations and manages geographically dispersed operations 
in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if its new facilities do not achieve growth sufficient to offset increased expenditures associated with geographic expansion 
the completion of the proposed transactions with ericsson will increase the company s expenses and working capital requirements 
should the company increase its expenditures in anticipation of a future level of sales that does not materialize  its profitability would be adversely affected 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production that can place an excessive burden on the company s resources 
acquisition of force computers  inc the acquisition of force computers  inc has created a number of challenges  including managing the integration of the operations  retaining key employees at force computers and managing an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business 
in addition  solectron has no significant prior experience in managing and operating a computer platform design business 
there can be no assurance the company will successfully manage this business or obtain the anticipated business synergy 
in the event that solectron is unsuccessful in managing and integrating the force computers business  the acquisition could require significant additional management attention 
if the company is unsuccessful in integrating and managing the force computers business  solectron s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
pending acquisition of ericsson manufacturing operation and related transactions in march  solectron entered into a memorandum of understanding with ericsson telecom ab s business area infocom systems ericsson to set up a new product introduction center in norrkoping and stockholm  sweden  transfer a portion of production from certain ericsson plants to solectron manufacturing sites and purchase an existing ericsson printed circuit board assembly operation 
in july  solectron and ericsson signed certain definitive agreements regarding these transactions 
in october  solectron acquired certain assets  primarily inventory and equipment  of ericsson s brazil operation and hired approximately persons formerly associated with the printed circuit board assembly operations of ericsson telcomunicacoes sa as employees of solectron s newly formed subsidiary  solectron brasil ltda 
under the terms of the agreement  ericsson will contract for solectron s services from solectron brasil ltda 
through september thereafter  solectron will bear the risk of filling the manufacturing capacity at the site with renewed business from ericsson or new business from other customers 
additional agreements related to the new product introduction center and the transfer of certain other assets are being negotiated 
these transactions are expected to undergo multiple closings though january  subject to the successful negotiation of additional definitive agreements and various closing conditions 
the proposed transactions with ericsson entail a number of risks  including successfully managing the integration of the operations  retention of key employees  integrating purchasing operations and information systems  managing an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business and renewing the ericsson business or replacing it with new business after expiration of the ericsson commitment 
in addition  the completion of the transactions with ericsson will increase solectron s expenses and working capital requirements and there is no assurance that solectron will achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses 
there can be no assurance the remaining transactions contemplated by the memorandum of understanding will close completely or that solectron will successfully manage the risks of these transactions 
international operations as a result of its international sales and facilities  the company s operations are subject to risks of doing business abroad  including but not limited to  fluctuations in the value of currency  export duties  changes to import and export regulations including quotas  possible restrictions on the transfer of funds  employee turnover  labor unrest  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and  in certain parts of the world  political instability 
while to date these factors have not had an adverse material impact on the company s results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be such an impact in the future 
in particular  the current instability in southeast asia s currencies  economy and political situation could adversely affect the company s operations in malaysia 
the company has been granted a tax holiday for its penang  malaysia site  which is effective through january   subject to certain conditions 
the company has also been granted various tax holidays in china 
these tax holidays are effective for various terms and are subject to certain conditions 
there is no assurance that any future tax holidays that the company may seek will be granted 
if additional tax holidays are not granted in the future  the company s effective income tax rate would likely increase 
availability of components a substantial portion of the company s net sales are derived from turnkey manufacturing in which the company provides both materials procurement and assembly 
in turnkey manufacturing  the company potentially bears the risk of component price increases  which could adversely affect the company s gross profit margins 
at various times there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry 
if significant shortages of components should occur  the company may be forced to delay manufacturing and shipments  which could have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the mix of turnkey and consignment projects  capacity utilization  price competition  the degree of automation that can be used in the assembly process  the efficiencies that can be achieved by the company in managing inventories and fixed assets  the timing of orders from major customers  fluctuations in demand for customer products  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and increased costs and shortages of components or labor 
turnkey manufacturing currently represents a substantial portion of solectron s sales 
turnkey projects  in which solectron procures some or all of the components necessary for production  typically generate higher net sales and higher gross profits with lower gross profit percentages than consignment projects due to the inclusion in solectron s operating results of sales and costs associated with the purchase and sale of components 
solectron assembles products with varying degrees of material content  which may cause solectron s gross margin to fluctuate 
in addition  the degree of startup costs and inefficiencies associated with new sites and new customer projects may affect solectron s gross margin 
all of these factors can cause fluctuations in the company s operating results 
competition the electronics manufacturing services industry is comprised of a large number of companies  several of which have achieved substantial market share 
the company also faces competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate solectron s capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
solectron competes with different companies depending on the type of service or geographic area 
certain competitors may have greater manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes that the primary basis of competition in its targeted markets is manufacturing technology  quality  responsiveness  the provision of value added services and price 
to be competitive  the company must provide technologically advanced manufacturing services  high product quality levels  flexible delivery schedules and reliable delivery of finished products on a timely and price competitive basis 
the company currently may be at a competitive disadvantage as to price when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures  particularly with respect to manufacturers with established facilities where labor costs are lower 
intellectual property protection the company s ability to compete may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company holds a limited number of us patents related to the process and equipment used in its surface mount technology 
in addition  the company s subsidiary  force computers  holds a number of patents related to vme technology 
the company believes these patents are valuable 
however  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide meaningful protection for the company s manufacturing process and equipment innovations or force s technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company or its customers in the future 
in the event a third party does assert an infringement claim  the company may be required to expend significant resources to develop a non infringing manufacturing process or technology or to obtain licenses to the manufacturing process or technology that is the subject of litigation 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such development or that any such licenses would be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  such litigation could be lengthy and costly and could have an adverse material effect on the company s financial condition regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
environmental compliance the company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process 
any failure by the company to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities or could require the company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
dependence on key personnel and skilled employees the company s continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of services of certain key personnel could have an adverse material effect on the company 
the company s business also depends upon its ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled employees 
failure to do so could adversely affect the company s operations 
possible volatility of market price of common stock the trading price of the common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  general conditions in the electronics industry and other factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations that affect the market price for many high technology companies in particular  and that often are unrelated to operating performance
