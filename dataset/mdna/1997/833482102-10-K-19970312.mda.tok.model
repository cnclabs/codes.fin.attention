item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations comparison of results to total revenues for were million  a million increase from the increase is in large part due to a million increase in gains on sales of investments which is primarily due to a million gain recognized in the fourth quarter related to an exchange of the company s stock held in command petroleum limited command  an australian affiliate  for stock in cairn energy plc cairn  a united kingdom based company 
an increase in oil and gas sales of million was also experienced in as a result of a rise in the price received per barrel of oil equivalent boe while production remained relatively stable compared to natural gas prices rebounded in to per mcf from per mcf in  a increase 
oil prices improved to average per barrel during partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in gas transportation  processing and marketing revenues of million primarily as a result of the sale of the company s wattenberg gas facilities in net income for was million  compared to a net loss in of million 
the income was boosted by the net effect of the command transaction million after minority interest expense and deferred tax expense 
however  the company also recorded a noncash charge of million in the second quarter related to the contribution of the company s wattenberg oil and gas properties to a newly formed public company  patina oil and gas corporation patina  in return for a stake in patina 
the loss was primarily due to million in noncash property impairment charges and almost million in combined losses resulting from a litigation settlement  losses on marketable securities  as well as severance and restructuring costs 
absent these special non recurring items  there was an increase in net income from to of approximately million 
this increase can be attributed primarily to the increase in average price received per boe which increased revenues million offset partially by a decrease in gas management margin of million and an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million 
revenues from production operations  less direct operating expenses  for were million  an increase of from net revenue 
average daily production during was  boe  almost exactly what it was in  boe 
however  the average product price received increased by to per boe 
production remaining relatively constant from to can be attributed to additional interests acquired in four gulf of mexico acquisitions in late and during and the properties acquired in the patina transaction offset by decreased production related to numerous sales of noncore properties which have occurred over the past two years and the reduction of development drilling 
the company focused the last two years on divesting of marginal assets and acquiring strategic assets that allow for future growth of the company 
this process is substantially complete and the company is now in position for growth 
the company expects to increase its development schedule in which  along with two acquisitions in the gulf of mexico in the fourth quarter  should result in an increase in production during total operating expenses for decreased by million in line with the company s efforts of divesting of marginal properties with high operating costs and acquiring incremental interests in offshore properties which have historically had lower operating costs per boe 
operating costs per boe were compared to in direct operating margin from gas transportation  processing and marketing for was million compared to million in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in processing margins due to the sale of the company s wattenberg gas processing facilities which was completed in the third quarter of the company realized almost million in sales proceeds during on these facilities and recognized a total of million in gains 
gains on sales of investments were million in  compared to million in the million gain on the command exchange accounted for the bulk of the increase

interest and other expense was million compared to million in the majority of the increase is the result of a higher average interest rate primarily due to patina s subordinated notes which have an effective interest rate of 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense in increased to million from million in the increase reflects an increase in the overall depletion  depreciation and amortization rate per equivalent barrel from to 
this increase can be attributed to downward revisions in reserve quantities at year end primarily in proved undeveloped reserves which became uneconomic at year end prices and the growing impact of the gulf of mexico operations which are typically more capital intensive thus having a higher depletion rate 
comparison of results to total revenues for were million  a million decline from the revenue decrease included million as a result of the suspension of low margin third party gas marketing activities late in and a million decrease due to the sale of the company s wattenberg gas facilities in oil and gas sales  on the other hand  rose by to million as a result of a growth in production of barrels of oil equivalent

sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company provided impairments for significant proved and unproved oil and gas property groups to the extent that net capitalized costs exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows 
sfas requires the company to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties on a property by property basis 
if an impairment is indicated based on undiscounted expected future cash flows  then an impairment is recognized to the extent that net capitalized costs exceed discounted expected future cash flows 
the decline from the net income also resulted from the decrease in natural gas prices and sharply increased financing costs  incurred prior to the reduction in outstanding debt accomplished during the latter half of revenues from production operations  less direct operating expenses  for were million  slightly greater than the net revenue 
average daily production during was  boe  up from levels  although the average product price received decreased by to per boe 
the production increase resulted primarily from newly drilled wells placed on production late in and during early in  the company placed wells on sales  including in the dj basin of colorado  in the austin chalk area of texas  in the green river basin of wyoming and six in the piceance basin of western colorado 
additionally  late in  the company sold its minor interest in a south texas field where nonoperated wells had been completed earlier in the year 
in the dj basin  the company completed wells in  but reduced its drilling in in response to the dramatic decrease in natural gas prices in the region 
the company expects to maintain a reduced development schedule in total operating expenses for increased by  in line with the production growth 
operating costs per boe were  essentially even with those of the prior year 
revenues from gas processing  transportation  and marketing  less direct expenses  for were million  compared to million in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in processing margins due to the sale of the company s wattenberg processing facilities

gas transportation and gathering margins from facilities retained by the company climbed during to million  associated with rising production and system expansions in southern wyoming and western colorado 
gas marketing net revenues declined by  between years  after the suspension of third party marketing activities in late gains on sales of properties were million in  compared to million in the million gain from the dj basin facility sales accounted for the bulk of the increase

senior debt was significantly reduced during the last half of the year with the proceeds from the sale of the wattenberg facilities and the west texas oil and gas properties 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense increased during the increase resulted from the growth in oil and gas production  offset somewhat by a reduction in the average depletion  depreciation and amortization rate per boe to in from in the effective income tax rate for was a benefit of three percent
