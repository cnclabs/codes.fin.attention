the most currently available estimate is that the aggregate cost of the clean up for the prp s will range from approximately million to million 
based on all available information as well as its prior experience  management believes the amount accrued of  which is net of a  payment made by the company  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of november  is reasonable in relation to its attributed share of total estimated costs 
this amount is subject to adjustment for future developments that may arise from the long range nature of this epa case  legislative changes  insurance coverage  the uncertainties associated with the ultimate outcome of the record of decision rod  the joint and several liability provisions of cercla  and the company s ability to successfully negotiate an outcome similar to its previous experience in these matters

the company has been notified that parties of which the company is one will likely be precluded from participating in a mediated settlement on a de minimis basis 
therefore  should the company choose to continue to participate in the prp group for the second phase  it is probable its payment to obtain a complete release will be greater than the de minimus parties settlement 
based on all available information as well as its prior experience  management believes a reasonable estimate of its ultimate liability for both phases is  and has accrued this amount in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of november  this amount is subject to future developments that may arise from the long range nature of this epa case  legislative changes  insurance coverage  the uncertainties associated with the ultimate outcome of the rod and the joint and several liability provisions of cercla  and the company s ability to successfully negotiate an outcome similar to its previous experience in these matters
