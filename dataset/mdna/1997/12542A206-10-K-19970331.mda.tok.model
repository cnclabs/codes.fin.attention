overview the company s net sales and net earnings have grown substantially during the past several years  in part due to acquisitions 
in and the company made acquisitions from unrelated parties as shown in the table below  captioned chs direct acquisitions  which table indicates the service areas of the operations acquired and the acquisition date 
these acquisitions have been included in the company s financial statements from the date the entity was acquired 
in addition  in march  the company acquired six entities from comtrad  then a majority owner of the company  which were recorded in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
accordingly  these acquisitions have been included in the company s financial statements from the date the entity was acquired by comtrad 
the company recorded the cost of such acquisitions from comtrad at comtrad s cost basis 
the company recorded goodwill with respect to these acquisitions if comtrad recorded goodwill when it purchased the subject entity  or later  if contingent consideration was paid 
such goodwill is being amortized over years 
as a result of both the chs direct acquisitions and the acquisitions from comtrad  the company expects the amortization of goodwill to be approximately million in as compared to approximately million in the table below  captioned chs acquisitions from comtrad  sets forth acquisitions from comtrad in the three years ended december   the service areas of the operations acquired  the assumed date of the acquisition by comtrad which is the date the results of operations were initially included in the company s financial statements and the company acquisition date

compared to net sales 
net sales increased million  or  from million in to billion in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
of the increase in net sales  subsidiaries acquired in late or contributed million 
net comparable sales of subsidiaries consolidated for both and grew million or 
this growth is attributed to increased consumer demand for microcomputer products offered by the company and the expansion of sales by the company s subsidiaries to include a full range of products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or from million in to million in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
gross profit on a comparable basis for subsidiaries consolidated for both and increased million or 
newly acquired companies contributed million of gross profit 
gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease was due to lower gross margins from subsidiaries located in western europe  particularly those operations acquired from merisel  which  as a result of high volumes of sales in those entities  had a significant impact on the company s gross margin as a whole 
the company attributes the decrease in gross margins to competitive pressures in this region  especially in germany 
the company s subsidiaries in germany had the lowest gross margin rate of all its european subsidiaries 
the company expects that overall gross margins may continue to decline in due to continued competitive pricing pressures  the fact that the gross margins of the acquired merisel companies have been generally lower than that of the company and will be included in the consolidation for the full year and the impact of the acquisition of frank walter  which operates in germany where gross margins are generally lower 
the gross margin of the combined merisel companies for the nine months ended september  on a pro forma basis was 
operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined from in to in the decline was due to efficiencies gained through increased volume and the company s efforts to control costs 
the reduction was achieved even though a provision of million was made for restructuring costs incurred by chs consisting of severance costs for chs employees  writeoff of chs leasehold improvements and lease termination costs of chs closed facilities to implement consolidation in markets in which a chs company previously existed and a company was acquired from merisel 
the operating expense ratio without such charge would have been for the year and in the fourth quarter of the company believes that this percentage will continue to decline in due to the impact of economies of scale as a result of the merisel acquisition 
net interest expense 
net interest expense increased million or from million in to million in the increase is directly related to the increase in average loan amounts outstanding 
income tax expense 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and minority interest in subsidiaries increased slightly from in to in management does not believe this change is significant 
the difference between this tax rate and the statutory united states tax rate is due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and lower foreign tax rates offset  to some extent  by losses in subsidiaries with no tax benefit and non deductible goodwill amortization 
the company expects to have an effective tax rate lower than the statutory united states tax rate in principally due to its ability to use remaining net operating loss carryforwards from certain subsidiaries and lower foreign tax rates in other subsidiaries 
compared to net sales 
net sales increased million or from million in to million in due principally to acquisitions and to a lesser extent  internal growth 
of the increase in net sales  subsidiaries formed or acquired in contributed million 
net sales of subsidiaries consolidated for part of and all of chs promark  chs england  chs france and chs belgium contributed million of the increase in net sales 
net sales of subsidiaries consolidated for all of and  which included chs germany  chs portugal and of chs czechia grew million or 
this growth is attributed to increased consumer demand for microcomputer products offered by the company 
net sales to comtrad related companies decreased from million in to million in and had a gross profit margin equivalent to sales to unaffiliated parties for similar products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or from million in to million in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
gross profit for subsidiaries included in the consolidation for all of and did not increase in proportion to sales as a result of the lowering of prices in germany in response to increased competition 
gross profit from such subsidiaries grew million or 
gross profit from subsidiaries consolidated for part of and all of grew million 
newly acquired companies contributed million of gross profit 
gross margin increased from in to in the increase was due to higher gross margins from subsidiaries consolidated for part of and all of the company attributes the increase in gross margin to greater sales of networking and software products which had higher gross margins than other products offered by the company 
operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales remained unchanged at in and net interest expense 
net interest expense increased million or from million in to million in the increase in interest expense is directly related to the increase in average loan amounts outstanding 
income tax expense 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes decreased from in to in the decrease in the company s net effective tax rate is attributed to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and lower foreign tax rates  offset to some extent by non deductible goodwill amortization 
seasonality the company may experience variability in its net sales and net income on a quarterly basis as a result of many factors  including the condition of the microcomputer industry in general  shifts in demand for software and hardware products and industry announcements of new products or upgrades 
sales in europe in the first and fourth quarters of each year are typically higher than in the second and third quarters 
in south america  sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year are typically higher than in the first and second quarters 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities in and was and million  respectively  due principally to increases in receivables  inventory and other current assets  offset to some extent by increases in accounts payable 
in both years these changes were reflective of sales increases and general business growth 
net cash used in investing activities in and was and million  respectively  due principally to acquisitions in and  to a lesser extent  to investments in fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was and million  respectively  due principally in to proceeds of the public offering  and in both years to borrowings under new debt agreements and increased borrowings under other agreements 
on february   chs promark entered into a loan and security agreement  as amended in october  providing for revolving credit advances and the issuance of letters of credit against eligible accounts receivable and inventory up to a maximum of million 
amounts outstanding bear interest  at the election of the borrower  at either a variable market rate based on the prime rate of the lender or libor 
the agreement limits the ability of chs promark to pay dividends to the company to of net income after taxes 
the agreement matures in october  and is secured by a lien on essentially all of chs promark s assets 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on transactions with affiliated companies and employee loans 
chs promark was in violation of these specific covenants at december   but waivers for these violations were granted by the financial institution 
the company has guaranteed this indebtedness 
the company s subsidiaries typically enter into short term credit agreements with financial institutions in their countries of operations 
as of december   the aggregate amount available under these agreements was million and million was then outstanding 
such agreements are usually for a term of one year and are secured by the receivables of the borrower 
the weighted average interest rate at december  was 
the company typically guarantees these loans 
the company derives all of its operating income and cash flow from its subsidiaries and relies on payments from  and intercompany borrowings with  its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations 
in certain countries  exchange controls may limit the ability of the company s subsidiaries to make payments to the company 
at december   there was no country with exchange control limitations in which the company had significant operations 
restrictions in financing or credit arrangements may also limit such payments 
claims of creditors of the company s subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets and cash flow of such subsidiaries over the claims of the company or its shareholders 
inflation the company operates in certain countries that have experienced high rates of inflation and hyperinflation 
however  inflation did not have any meaningful impact on the company s results of operations in the three year period ended december   and the company does not expect that it will have a material impact in asset management inventory 
the company s goal is to achieve high inventory turns and maintain a low number of skus and thereby reduce the company s working capital requirements and improve return on equity 
the company s strategy to achieve this goal is to both effectively manage its inventory and achieve high order fill rates 
to reduce the risk of loss to the company due to vendor price reductions and slow moving or obsolete inventory  the company s contracts with its vendors generally provide price protection and stock rotation privileges  subject to certain limitations 
price protection allows the company to offset the accounts payable owed to a particular vendor if such vendor reduces the price of products the company has purchased within a specified period of time and which remain in inventory 
stock rotation permits the company to return to the vendor for full credit  with an offsetting purchase order for new products  pre determined amounts of inventory purchased within a specified period of time 
such credit is typically used to offset existing invoices due without incurring re stocking fees 
accounts receivable 
the company manages its accounts receivable to balance the need of its customers to purchase on credit with its desire to minimize its credit losses 
bad debt expense as a percentage of the company s net sales for the years ended  and was  
and  respectively 
the company s credit losses have been minimized by its extensive credit approval process and the use of credit insurance and factoring by its western european subsidiaries 
in its sales to customers in south america  the company often receives post dated checks at the time of sale 
customers who qualify for credit are typically granted payment terms appropriate to the customs of each country 
currency risk management functional currency 
the company s functional currency  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no  is the united states dollar 
the local currencies of the countries where subsidiaries conduct operations are considered the functional currencies for such entities 
most of the company s subsidiaries use the local currencies as their functional currency and translate assets and liabilities using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and results of operations using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
translation effects are reflected in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in equity 
the company s exposure under these translation rules  which is unhedged  may affect the carrying value of its foreign net assets and therefore its equity and net tangible book value  but not its net income or cash flow 
exchange differences arising from transactions and balances in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded as expense or income in the subsidiaries and the company and affect the statements of earnings 
hedging 
the company attempts to limit its risk of currency fluctuations through hedging 
in  a significant amount of the purchases of products by the company were made in united states dollars and approximately of company sales were made in currencies other than the united states dollar 
the most significant currencies in which sales were made were the german mark of sales  the british pound and the french franc 
at december   approximately million of accounts payable were attributable to foreign currency liabilities denominated in dollars and approximately of these liabilities were unhedged 
chs finance 
in march  the company formed chs finance as a finance company for the company s distribution activities 
chs finance engages in central treasury functions including hedging activities related to foreign currency for the company and short term working capital loans to the company s subsidiaries to enable them to take advantage of early payment discounts offered by certain vendors 
these loans are denominated in the currency of the borrower or us dollars 
generally  chs finance hedges its receivables denominated in currencies other than its functional currency  the swiss franc 
it attempts to limit the amount of unhedged receivables to an amount which approximates the us dollar denominated loans payable by the company s subsidiaries 
in the fourth quarter of  the company modified this policy to allow unhedged receivables  principally in us dollars and german marks  of an amount approximately equal to its total unhedged liabilities 
this modified policy continued through the first quarter of the company intends to review this policy periodically and may modify it in the future 
through both hedging activities coordinated by chs finance and local country activities in certain subsidiaries  the company makes forward purchases of dollars in an attempt to hedge local european currencies and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
additionally  in certain countries in eastern europe and in south america where it is not practical to make forward purchases  to minimize exposure to currency devaluations  the company has adopted a policy of attempting to match accounts receivable with accounts payable and to limit holdings of local currencies 
factors which affect exchange rates are varied and no reliable prediction methods are available for determining the likely future exchange rates 
in general  countries make an effort to maintain stability in rates for trade purposes 
there can be no assurance that these asset management programs will be effective in limiting the company s exposure to these risks
