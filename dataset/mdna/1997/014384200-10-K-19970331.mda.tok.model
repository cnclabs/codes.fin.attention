item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business conditions aldila  inc the company is principally in the business of designing  manufacturing and marketing graphite carbon fiber based composite golf club shafts  with approximately of its net sales resulting from sales to golf club manufacturers for inclusion in their clubs 
as a result  the company s operating results are substantially dependent not only on demand by its customers for the company s shafts  but also on demand by consumers for clubs including graphite shafts such as the company s 
historically  graphite shafts have principally been offered by manufacturers of higher priced  premium golf clubs  and the company s sales have been predominantly of premium graphite shafts 
in addition  until recently  the united states market for graphite shafts was dominated by a relatively small number of united states based shaft manufacturers 
both of these aspects of the graphite shaft market have been changing 
as a high percentage of premium clubs are already sold with graphite shafts  as compared to a smaller percentage of value priced clubs  the company anticipates that growth in graphite shaft usage in the future will be greater in the value priced segment of the market than in the premium segment  depending on the availability in the marketplace of graphite shafts at lower price points 
management of the company expects sales of shafts for the value priced club market to increase significantly over the next several years  although management also anticipates that sales of premium shafts will continue to represent a majority of the company s sales measured in dollars for the foreseeable future 
over the last several years  the number of shaft manufacturers of graphite golf shafts serving the united states premium club market has increased  including affiliates of foreign manufacturers that had previously not had significant sales in the united states 
these two overall trends in the graphite shaft marketplace have had the effect  and are expected by management to continue to have the effect for at least the next several years  of decreasing the average selling price of the company s shafts 
although the company s gross profit margin is being adversely affected by the reduction in average selling price and continuing increases in raw material costs  these adverse effects on gross margin should be mitigated to some extent by efforts being taken by the company to control costs  including manufacturing its own graphite prepreg and  starting in its own carbon fiber  increased automation and increasing the percentage of its shafts being manufactured in countries with lower labor and overhead costs 
in recent years  the company s results of operations have been materially affected on several occasions by dramatic year to year changes in its sales to an individual golf club manufacturer customer 
such changes can result either from decisions by the customer to increase or decrease shaft purchases from an alternative supplier or from the traditional volatility in consumer demand for specific clubs 
the company believes that this volatility is likely to continue in the future  particularly as club manufacturers seek to gain competitive advantages through an increased rate of technological innovation in club design 
the company s results will benefit whenever it has an opportunity to supply the latest hot club and will be adversely affected whenever sales of clubs containing aldila shafts drop dramatically 
the company also believes that while it will often not be possible to predict  with any certainty  such shifts in advance  the company s broad range of club manufacturer customers should reduce in some cases the extent of the impact on the company s financial results 
in recent years  the company has benefited from strong sales of its shafts to callaway golf company callaway resulting from the popularity of callaway s clubs 
during  and sales to callaway comprised  and  respectively  of the company s total net sales 
although sales to callaway as a percentage of the company s net sales has decreased over the last several years and is expected to decrease again in  the company s results of operations continue to be dependent on sales to callaway  and as a result  further significant decreases in sales to callaway could have a significant adverse impact on the company s sales or earnings 
based in part  however  on callaway s statements to the company that it will continue to be callaway s primary supplier of graphite golf club shafts  the company expects that callaway will continue to be the company s largest customer for the foreseeable future 
the company continues to serve a broad range of golf club manufacturers  and  in part as a result of the success in the marketplace of clubs manufactured by several of these other customers  sales to other customers in addition to callaway are likely to represent significant percentages of the company s net sales over the next several years

see overview 
total unit sales decreased and the average selling price of shafts sold decreased in as compared to gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or to million in from million in principally as a result of the decrease in net sales 
the company s gross profit margin decreased to in from in primarily as a result of lower average selling prices for shafts and fixed costs being spread over reduced operating levels 
the company s gross profit margins are impacted by the price it pays for carbon fibers  the most substantial component of total raw material costs 
operating income 
operating income decreased million  or  to million in from million in and decreased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of net sales to in as compared to in as a result of the fixed component of selling  general and administrative costs being spread over lower net sales in this percentage increase occurred despite decreases in marketing and promotional expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in and the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was in and other income 
other income increased to  in as compared to  in as a result of increased investment income on higher average cash balances along with higher rates of return in income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in was as compared to in the increase resulted primarily from the decrease in profit before tax with constant non deductible amortization of goodwill in each year 
liquidity and capital resources since november  the only indebtedness of the company has been million in senior notes due the company has not used borrowings to finance its operations or provide working capital for over five years and does not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future 
the company s belief that it will not otherwise need to finance its operations with borrowings is based on assumptions that it will continue to be profitable  with positive cash provided by operating activities  and that changes in the pace of technological development in shaft design and manufacturing processes will not result in substantially higher levels of spending on capital expenditures and research and development than the company has recently incurred 
cash including cash equivalents provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in this decrease resulted partially from the increase in inventory in to support the higher sales levels at the end of the company used million for capital expenditures during  primarily related to adding machinery and equipment intended to improve manufacturing efficiencies in existing facilities  to add other manufacturing technologies and to add additional manufacturing capacity in order to meet the anticipated demand 
the company currently anticipates committing to capital expenditures of approximately million in primarily related to development and construction of a new facility for the manufacture of carbon fiber 
management estimates that the design  construction and start up of the planned  square foot facility will require approximately months  and a capital expenditure of approximately million 
the company plans to use existing cash and cash provided by operating activities to fund the project 
the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s business 
the company anticipates that its cash requirements for maintaining its current level of operations and those planned for the foreseeable future can be satisfied by cash provided through operating activities 
the company could require additional debt financing  however  if it were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
on october  the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock 
the company intends to repurchase shares from time to time in the market at then prevailing prices  depending on market and general economic conditions 
the company repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share in and approximately  shares at an average price of per share in seasonality because the company s customers have historically built inventory in anticipation of purchases by golfers in the spring and summer  the principal selling season for golf equipment  the company s operating results have been affected by seasonal demand for golf clubs  which has generally resulted in higher sales in the second and third quarters 
the success of certain customers products  patterns of product introduction  and customer acceptance thereof  coupled with a generally increasing overall demand for graphite shafts  has tended to mitigate the impact of seasonality in recent years
