item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion for wonderware corporation the company contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual future results could differ materially from those forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  total revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring and severance costs operating income loss before acquired in process research and development costs acquired in process research and development costs operating income loss other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss comparison of to total revenues 
total revenues include sales of software licenses and services  less promotional discounts and sales returns 
the company s revenues for increased percent to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased unit sales of the wonderware intouch product line 
the revenue increase also reflected to a lesser extent increased sales of the wonderware intrack products and the introduction of wonderware inbatch 
revenues also increased slightly due to the acquisition of ict wonderware gmbh ict wonderware  the company s distributor in germany 
revenues subsequent to the close of the acquisition in mid december reflect higher unit sales prices because there is no longer a distributor markdown associated with such sales 
revenues from the wonderware intouch product line represented approximately percent of the company s total sales in as compared to percent in the company expects that revenues from these products will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s total sales in future periods  but that the share of revenues derived from other products will increase if new products introduced by the company gain market acceptance 
international sales increased to million in from million in despite overall growth in international sales during  international sales growth has slowed relative to total sales  contributing percent of total revenues for as compared to percent in the decline in international sales growth is primarily due to the increased competitive pressures and a recessionary economy in europe 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenues 
the company s international operations are subject to various risks  including seasonality  regulatory requirements  political and economic instability and trade restrictions 
although the company s sales have been typically made in us dollars  the company s recently acquired german operation conducts its business in german marks 
therefore  a portion of the company s revenues are now directly subject to the risk of currency fluctuations in that market 
in addition  a weakening in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have an adverse impact on the effective price of the company s products in other international markets 
the company expects that it will increasingly be required to transact in local currencies in order to further its growth internationally and will become more directly exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate due in large measure to the recent emergence of some of the company s markets  the future effect of product enhancements and future competition 
declines in demand for these products  whether as a result of competition  technological change  price reductions or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company s historical growth rates or operating margins will resume or  if resumed  will be sustained in the future 
during  the company plans to begin shipment of the wonderware factorysuite 
there will be two versions of the factorysuite 
these suites will bundle together the development versions of most of the company s products into a single package 
the wonderware factory suite will be sold at a greatly reduced price when compared to buying each of the company s current products separately 
the large discount available to the customer when buying the wonderware factorysuite could have an adverse impact on the company s future revenues from its other products 
also  it is expected that some of the company s competitors  some of whom have greater resources than the company  will offer similar suites of products 
there can also be no assurance that the wonderware factorysuite will gain market acceptance 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes the costs of manuals  diskettes and duplication  packaging materials  assembly  paper goods  third party royalties and shipping 
cost of sales for the years ended december  and include the amortization of developed technology acquired as part of the acquisition of soft systems engineering  inc sse in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
all internal costs related to research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products are expensed as incurred 
the company s gross margin decreased to percent in from percent in the decrease was primarily due to increased documentation included with recent releases of the company s products 
the product documentation is being converted to an electronic format  and the company anticipates that this will result in cost savings  contingent upon the acceptance of the electronic documentation format by its customers 
gross margin is expected to decline over the next fiscal year as new products incorporating additional third party software royalties begin shipping 
gross profit increased percent to million in from million in primarily due to increased revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct the company s development effort 
research and development expenses for increased percent to million in  from million in  and increased as a percentage of revenues to percent from percent 
approximately half of the increase in cost is attributable to operating expenses of entities acquired during the latter half of the remaining increase is primarily due to the addition of development personnel associated with the company s core product line  as well as other products 
the company believes that the introduction of new technologies and products to the industrial automation market in a timely manner is crucial to its success 
as a consequence  the company has increased the amount of its expenditures on research and development 
for the foreseeable future  the company anticipates that it will continue to increase spending in absolute dollars on research and development for both the enhancement of current products  the addition of new product capabilities and the integration efforts associated with the wonderware factorysuite 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
because the company believes that its current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  no internal software development costs were capitalized as of december  significant new products developed in the future may require the capitalization of internal software development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs of administrative  sales and marketing personnel  advertising and promotional expenses  and customer service and technical support costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of revenue to percent from percent 
the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increased staffing in field sales and marketing required to further penetrate current and new markets for the company s products  increased staffing in technical support to provide service to the company s new product lines  increased staffing and other costs in administrative functions to support the overall growth of the company  and operating costs associated with the entities acquired in the second half of the company expects that such expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as it expands its worldwide sales distribution and customer support network to penetrate new markets for its production management products  as well as to increase worldwide market penetration for its wonderware intouch product line

provision for income taxes 
the company recognized had an effective tax rate of percent in the change in the rate for from  exclusive of the tax effect related to the write off on in process research and development costs  was due to an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets based on an evaluation of the recoverability of such deferred tax assets 
any tax benefits not realized by the company in may be recoverable in future years should the company generate taxable income in those years 
net loss 
due to the increasing level of spending in the areas of research and development  and in selling  general and administrative functions as discussed above  the company anticipates that when the company s operations return to profitability  net income as a percentage of total revenues will continue to be lower than historical levels 
there can be no assurance as to when  if ever  the company will resume profitable operations 
comparison of to total revenues 
the company s revenues for increased percent to million from million in the increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased unit sales of the wonderware intouch product line  due in part to investments in the company s worldwide sales distribution and customer support network 
revenues from the wonderware intouch product line represented approximately percent of the company s total sales 
international sales were million  or percent of total revenues  in and million  or percent of total revenues  in the growth in international sales was the result of increased market penetration  as well as expansion of the company s presence in both europe and asia 
the strategic acquisitions completed during the second half of did not result in significant additional revenue streams in gross profit 
the company s gross margin increased to percent in from percent in the increase was primarily due to cost control measures implemented in the area of inventory purchasing  including the execution of volume purchase agreements

fluctuations in quarterly operating results many software companies experience seasonal variations in revenues  with soft domestic sales in the first quarter and soft european sales in the third quarter 
although the significant growth in the company s total revenues over the past several years may have masked seasonal variations in the company s operating results  the company believes that its results of operations are subject to similar quarterly variations 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results in the current year 
the company expects to experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors  including  among others delays in introduction of products or product enhancements by the company  the company s competitors or other providers of hardware  software and components for the industrial automation market  costs associated with product or technology acquisitions  the size and timing of individual orders  software bugs or other product quality problems  competition and pricing in the software industry  seasonality of revenues  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  market acceptance of new products  reductions in demand for existing products and shortening of product life cycles as a result of new product introductions  changes in distributors ordering patterns  changes in operating expenses  changes in company strategy  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory requirements and political and economic instability in foreign markets  mix of products sold  and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company ships software within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues and the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall 
accordingly  operating results would be adversely affected by a reduction in revenues in that quarter since the majority of the company s expenses are fixed 
any significant weakening in demand would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s operating results and on the company s ability to achieve profitability 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
based in part on the growth in the overall industrial automation software market and the company s penetration of that market  as well as the geographic and industry diversity of the company s customers  the company believes that general economic conditions have not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations to date 
there can be no assurance  however  that economic conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 
liquidity and capital resources the company currently finances its operations including capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and its current cash and short term investment balances 
the short term investments consist of highly rated  taxable  short term securities selected to maximize the company s after tax return on its excess funds at a relatively low risk level 
in  operating activities provided cash totaling  primarily related to depreciation and amortization expense  an increase in accounts payable and the write off of acquired in process research and development costs offset by operating losses and increases in deferred taxes  other assets and inventory 
in  operating activities provided cash totaling million primarily related to operating income before acquired in process research and development costs  depreciation and amortization expense and increases in accrued expenses  offset by increases in deferred taxes  accounts receivable  and other assets 
the net loss in resulted from the write off of acquired in process research and development costs 
as these were non cash transactions  the company s liquidity was not impacted 
in  operating activities provided cash totaling million primarily related to net income and depreciation and amortization expense and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenues  offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels 
at december   the company s cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances totaled million 
during  the company generated cash from investing activities totaling million 
net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments generated approximately million in cash 
this was offset by million used for the purchase of property and equipment and million used for the purchase of the outstanding shares of ict wonderware see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company used cash in investing activities totaling million 
of this amount  million was used to purchase property and equipment   was used in acquisitions and million was used for the purchase of short term investments

the company maintains an unsecured bank line of credit with a domestic bank expiring in may that provides for borrowings up to million at the bank s prime rate 
no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit at december  the company plans to renew the line of credit at terms comparable to the current agreement 
the company s new german subsidiary maintains a separate bank line of credit in germany which expires in october this line of credit provides for maximum borrowings of dm  at the german bank s prime rate 
approximately  of borrowings against the german credit line were outstanding as of december  the company s principal commitments as of december  consisted primarily of leases on its headquarters and other facilities  and there were no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company believes that its cash and short term investment balances and availability under its bank lines of credit as of december   and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months
