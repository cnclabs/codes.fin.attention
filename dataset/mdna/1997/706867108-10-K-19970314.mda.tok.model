for the period from inception through december   the company incurred a cumulative net loss of  penederm s sources of working capital have been equity financings  product sales to corporate partners  sales of over the counter products  product license fees and sales of topicare delivery compounds and interest earned on investments 
results of operations total revenues of  declined from total revenues of  revenues increased from  in the revenue decrease is primarily due to reduced in license revenues as well as decreases in lubriderm alpha hydroxy formula and the related topicare delivery compound sales 
license revenues in of  decreased from license revenues of  license fees were received from warner and smithkline in  schering plough  ucb and smithkline in and from schering plough and warner in total product sales declined by to  in from  in due primarily to lower quantities of lubriderm products shipped to warner as compared to slower sales to warner also negatively impacted sales of topicare delivery compounds 
total product sales declined by in from  in due primarily to decreased shipments of lubriderm to warner from launch quantities  and decreased penederm cream and lotion sales  partially offset by increased sales of topicare delivery compounds 
the company expects its future revenues in the near term to be derived principally from the sale of its recently approved pharmaceutical products  and for the revenues derived from otc dry skin products and cosmetic products to become less significant relative to total revenues 
the company s cost of sales declined to  in from  in due to the decrease in product sales 
cost of sales declined in from  in due to the lower dry skin product shipments 
the company s research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in and increased in from  in the spending decrease is related to the timing and size of later stage human clinical trials compared to the prior year 
the increase also related to the commencement of certain human clinical trials which were significantly larger than the prior year 
sales  marketing  general and administrative expenses increased in to  from  in and  in this increase is due primarily to increased legal costs related to enforcement of patent rights  and the costs of pre launch preparations for mentax offset by continued reductions in otc promotions and reduced personnel costs 
in  reduced promotional efforts related to penederm dry skin cream and lotion products were offset by increased costs related to new business arrangements and patent work 
the company had net interest income of   and  in  and  respectively 
net interest income declined in and increased in this decrease is primarily the result of lower cash balances available for investment in the increase in is due to the net effect of lower average cash and investment balances offset by higher interest rates being earned on these balances 
as of december   the company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of the company expects that total revenues  and costs and expenses will increase in the future  due principally to further commercialization of its recently approved pharmaceutical products 
costs and expenses are expected to increase significantly in sales and marketing as these products are promoted and sold in the marketplace 
the company also expects expansion of research and development programs  increased patent and regulatory costs  expansion of regulatory  clinical  and quality assurance capabilities  and increased administrative support costs 
therefore  additional operating losses are expected in the near future 
in addition  sales of a product upon initial market introduction generally include a significant amount of initial orders for inventory by wholesalers and distributors and are not necessarily indicative of actual demand for that product by patients and physicians 
there can be no assurance that distributors and wholesalers will be able to forecast demand for product accurately 
fluctuations in operating results will occur to the extent that resales do not meet distributors or wholesalers expectations 
the company also expects that future operating results may be subject to quarterly variations that may impact cash flow from operations 
operating results for the year ended december  are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources in november  the company completed its initial public offering of common stock  raising approximately  net of expenses 
prior to the initial public offering  the company financed operations primarily through private placements of its equity securities  interest income earned on investment of cash  initial sales of products and product license fees 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling  cash expenditures related to operating activities  the acquisition of fixed assets and repayment of long term debt totaled  in and  in operating activities were comprised of research and development  clinical trials  product sales  promotion and general administration activities 
the company also made milestone payments of  and  related to the in licensing of drug compounds in and  respectively 
the company expects that amounts expended historically are not indicative of future expenditures by the company  which the company believes will increase 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to the further research and development of its technologies  development of its products  acquisition of additional products and rights to drug compounds and sales and marketing 
in march  the company announced that it signed an agreement for a million private placement of common stock  the closing of which is conditioned upon the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the resale of the shares to be issued in the transaction 
the company believes that  if the private placement is completed  existing capital resources after giving effect to the net proceeds of the private placement transaction  including the interest income earned on its invested cash balances  together with anticipated revenues consisting of product sales  license fees and royalties  will satisfy the company s working capital and identified capital expenditure requirements at least through however  there can be no assurance that the private placement will be completed or that  if completed  the proceeds to the company will be sufficient to finance its future operations 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of the company s collaborative and independent research and development programs  payments received under collaborative agreements with other companies  if any  the results and costs of preclinical and clinical testing for the company s products  the costs associated with and the timing of regulatory approvals  technological advances  the status of competitive products  and the commercial success of penederm s licensing and marketing efforts 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to the company on favorable terms  if at all  to permit the company to continue with its plan for operations
