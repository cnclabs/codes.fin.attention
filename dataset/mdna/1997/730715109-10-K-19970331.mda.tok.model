item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the company for the years ended december   and  and of certain factors that may affect the company s prospective financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein 
for the reasons set forth below including the reclassification into assets held for sale of a substantial portion of the company s assets in the third quarter of and related accounting consequences the company s results of operations and cash flows for are not comparable to prior periods 
overview dignity partners  inc is a specialty financial services company 
the principal business activity of the company through february was to provide viatical settlements for terminally ill persons 
a viatical settlement is the payment of cash in return for an ownership interest in  and right to receive the death benefit face value from  a life insurance policy 
the company was formed in september as a wholly owned subsidiary of echelon  commenced operations on january  and commenced purchasing life insurance policies in april effective september   echelon was merged with and into dignity partners as part of the reorganization 
see the company the reorganization and the reverse stock split 
the merger had no material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations except for the effect on per share calculations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cessation of viatical settlement business  sale of assets on july  the company announced that  in light of the data regarding new treatments involving combinations of various drugs presented at the aids conference  the company was temporarily ceasing processing new applications for policies insuring individuals afflicted with aids and hiv while it further analyzed the effects of such research results on its business and its strategic options 
further analysis resulted in the company s concluding that the efficacy of the treatments reported at the aids conference and subsequently reported treatments have increased the risks of purchasing and holding policies insuring the lives of individuals diagnosed with hiv and aids  especially those individuals with longer life expectancies 
the company decided in the third quarter of to sell all or substantially all of its assets 
as a result of such decision  the company reclassified all of its assets other than the policies held by dpfc to a held for sale category during the third quarter of accordingly  such assets are accounted for on the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
the company cannot predict what further impact the foregoing may have on its business  prospects  results of operations or financial position 
the company sought and received on december stockholder approval to sell all or substantially all of its assets 
based on the company s evaluation of the effects of the research results reported at the aids conference and subsequent reports and other information  the company believes that it is extremely difficult to predict accurately life expectancy of people afflicted with hiv and aids 
further  the company decided that it is not viable to continue to operate a viatical settlement business solely for non aids policies while a market for non aids policies develops  if it develops at all 
as a result  the board of directors in february approved the cessation of the viatical settlement business and the sale by the company of its non aids policies  consisting of approximately policies with a face value of million 
if the company is successful in selling such policies  the only remaining policies will be those held by dpfc 
through march  the company had sold or entered into agreements to sell approximately policies with an aggregate purchase price of million  representing million in aggregate face value 
the company reported a pre tax loss of  in and expects to report a pre tax gain of million in the first half of in connection with the policies sold pursuant to these sale agreements 
see year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss on assets sold 
method of accounting through june   the company recognized income earned discount on each purchased policy by accruing  over the period between the acquisition date of the policy and the company s estimated date of collection of the policy s face value the accrual period  the difference the unearned discount between a the face value of the policy less the amount of fees  if any  payable to a referral source upon collection of the face value  and b the carrying value of the policy 
through june   the carrying value for each policy was reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet under purchased life insurance policies and consisted of the purchase price  other capitalized costs and the earned discount on the policy accrued to the balance sheet date 
the company capitalized as incurred the following costs of a purchased policy i the purchase price paid for the policy  ii policy premiums  if any  paid by the company  iii amounts  if any  paid to referral sources upon acquisition of the policy and iv amounts paid to consultants ie  independent physicians or other medical consultants retained for the purpose of estimating the insured s life expectancy 
the carrying value of a policy changed over time  and was adjusted quarterly to reflect earned discounts accrued on the policy  amounts paid for any additional future increases in coverage  any additional premium payments and any premium refunds if the policy becomes covered by premium waiver provisions 
the length of the accrual period was determined by the company based upon its estimate of the date on which it would collect the face value of the policy 
such estimate was based upon the company s estimate of the life expectancy of the insured  after review of the medical records of the insured by one or more consultants  and was also adjusted to reflect the historical accuracy of the life expectancies estimated by the consultants and the typical period between the date of an insured s death and the date on which the company collects the face value of the policy 
the unearned discount was accrued over the accrual period using the level yield interest method 
under the level yield method  the yield is constant such that when the yield is applied to the carrying value of the policy on a compounded basis over the course of the accrual period  the unearned discount will be fully accrued as earned discount by the end of the accrual period 
such yield may differ from the actual yield on a policy depending on whether the policy is collected earlier or later than expected 
as a result of the company s decision to sell all or substantially all of its assets  the company established a reserve for loss on sale of assets during the quarter ended september  the company also established a reserve for loss of the company s equity interest in dpfc during the quarter ended september  because of the uncertainties created by the data presented at the aids conference and subsequent reports of the efficacy of new treatments for aids hiv 
as of december   such reserves were million and million  respectively 
in addition  beginning in the third quarter of  the company began generally recognizing income upon receipt of proceeds on policies either pursuant to sale or the death of the insured 
such income is equal to the difference between such proceeds less any back end sourcing fees and the carrying value of such policies after giving effect to any reserve for loss on the sale of such policies or any reserve for loss of the company s equity interest in dpfc 
the calculation of the reserve for loss on assets held for sale was calculated based on the life expectancies of the insureds under the policies in relation to prices obtained by the company in connection with other sales 
method of consolidation the company s financial statements consolidate the assets  liabilities and operations of dpfc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary through which the company issued the securitized notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
dpfc has purchased policies with an aggregate face value of million and will not purchase any more policies 
the carrying value of the policies held by dpfc was million at december  in addition  because dignity partners controlled dignity viatical  the assets  liabilities and operations of dignity viatical have been consolidated with those of the company in the consolidated financial statements 
through june   dignity viatical had purchased policies with an aggregate face value of million 
the minority interest of former limited partners in investment partnership reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements represents the limited partners interests in the net assets and income of dignity viatical 
on june   the company purchased the limited partnership interests in dignity viatical and became the sole owner of all the partnership interests therein 
on august   the company entered into an agreement to sell to an unaffiliated third party virtually all of the policies owned by dignity viatical 
see the company dignity viatical and dignified one 
certain accounting implications for dpfc under generally accepted accounting principles  to the extent that the carrying value of the assets of dpfc are less than the carrying value of its liabilities  the company would be required to recognize a loss equal to the amount of such difference  notwithstanding the non recourse nature of the securitized notes 
at december  and february   the carrying value of the assets of dpfc were million and million  respectively consisting of purchased life insurance policies  restricted cash and a portion of matured policies receivables and its liabilities were million and million  respectively consisting of long term notes payable  ie the securitized notes 
although the securitized notes had an expected life of years when the aggregate maximum principal amount of the securitized notes was increased from million to million in september  the company does not believe that the securitized notes will be retired through collections by october the company believes that  if the securitized notes are not retired by late  the assets of dpfc will become less than its liabilities because the costs of carrying the securitized notes  including interest and servicing and trustee fees  will deplete collections available to repay principal 
in the event that the collection experience for dpfc policies is substantially delayed  the assets of dpfc may become less than its liabilities before late additionally  if the collection experience for the dpfc policies is substantially delayed  the value of the assets of dpfc may erode further for some of the following reasons 
first  a decision to discontinue paying premiums on some policies may be made because the present value of the expected death benefit on some policies may be less than expected future premiums to be paid on such policies 
second  the face value of certain policies especially group term may begin to decrease as the people whose lives are insured thereunder reach specified age levels often 
finally  policies for which the insurance was continued under a disability provision may be uneconomical to convert given the insured s age and life expectancy if such insured person is no longer considered disabled 
the company cannot determine at present which  if any  policies held by dpfc would be so affected 
in light of the foregoing  the company believes that it is possible that the company may  in the future under generally accepted accounting principles  be required to recognize a further loss to the extent that the carrying value of the assets of dpfc is less than its liabilities 
however  when the securitized notes are finally discharged or mature  the company under generally accepted accounting principles would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of any such losses recognized 
the securitized notes represent the obligations solely of dpfc and were not guaranteed by the company 
therefore  the company is not required to fund any principal deficiencies 
share repurchase program in october  the board of directors of the company approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which the company is authorized to purchase from time to time up to million shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
through december    shares had been repurchased at a weighted average price of per share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  earned discounts 
the company purchased policies with an aggregate face value of million during the year ended december  compared to the purchase of policies with an aggregate face value of million during of the policies purchased in  policies with an aggregate face value of million were purchased in the second half of the year 
earned discounts on life insurance policies decreased from million during to million through june  effective june   the company reclassified all of its assets other than the policies held by dpfc to a held for sale category 
the company also established a reserve to reflect estimated loss of the company s equity interest in dpfc because of the uncertainties created by the data presented at the aids conference and subsequently reported data 
as a result  beginning on july   the company began recognizing income only upon receipt of proceeds on policies pursuant to the death of the insured 
consequently  the company did not recognize any earned discounts on life insurance policies during the second half of  but instead recognized  of earned discounts on matured policies for such period 
such income is equal to the difference between the proceeds the company received on the policies less any back end sourcing fees and the carrying value of such policies after giving effect to any reserve for loss on the sale of such policies and any reserve for loss of the company s equity interest in dpfc 
see notes d  e  and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in connection with the decision to sell all or substantially all of the company s assets  in the third quarter of the company recognized  of earned discounts on prior maturities 
such earned discounts were carried on the balance sheet at june  as unearned income which related to policies for which the company had collected the proceeds prior to the expected collection date 
the company has not had earned discounts on prior maturities since the third quarter of and will have none in future periods 
interest income 
interest income increased dramatically in as a result of the investment of the initial public offering proceeds in short term securities and marketable securities 
interest income has decreased since the beginning of as such funds were used to purchase life insurance policies and for other working capital purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income 
components of other income include collections on policies of dividends  interest  paid up cash values  increases in face value of matured policies and reimbursements of premiums on matured policies 
other income increased during due mainly to collections on a larger portfolio and a  aggregate increase in face value on two policies 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in as a result of the higher level of portfolio purchases and the increase in borrowings used to fund those purchases 
average borrowings under the securitized notes were million in compared to million in the interest rate on the securitized notes decreased to in october from 
borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility bore a dollar weighted interest rate of and in and  respectively 
average borrowings were  in compared to million in see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  and liquidity and capital resources and description of securitized notes below for further information regarding the securitized notes and revolving credit facility 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits increased in compared to due to the hiring of additional personnel to handle the administrative tasks relating to the company s relatively larger portfolio and non broker referral business and to support the company s relative growth in the first six months of subsequent to the aids conference and the cessation of new application processing  the number of employees decreased from on july  to at december  other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in expenses for legal  accounting  insurance  director fees and advertising increased in an aggregate of  in part as a result of the company s status as a public company  activities related to the special meeting of stockholders of the company held in december and new business development activities 
additionally  because the company ceased processing applications for policies insuring individuals with aids and hiv  approximately  of medical review costs associated with such policies in the underwriting process were expensed in the company also recorded in  a one time expense of  to recognize the fair value of warrants issued to jefferies company to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization 
because the company prepaid its revolving credit facility in august  the company incurred a charge in the third quarter of of  as a result of the company s writing off the unamortized financing charges related to that facility 
net loss on assets sold 
the total net loss recorded in on assets sold was  on august   the company sold policies held by dignity viatical and two other policies to an unaffiliated third party 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax loss in the amount of approximately  also recorded in  was a gain totaling  on proceeds collected in respect to policies sold pursuant to the september sale agreement 
the realized gain was calculated based on the difference between the sale value and the carrying value after giving effect to the provision for loss on sale of assets 
provision for loss on assets held for sale 
the company recorded in a provision for loss on sale of assets totaling million based on management s estimate of proceeds from the sale of policies 
the provision equals the difference between the carrying value of policies and those estimates 
the estimates are based on the life expectancies of the insureds covered by the policies  the estimated sale period and the prices obtained by the company in connection with other sales of policies 
for purposes of calculating such loss provisions  furniture and equipment have been valued on the assumption that miscellaneous office equipment has no sales value 
loss on investment in wholly owned financing subsidiary 
as of june   the company had an initial capital investment recorded of million and  through consolidation  an additional million of increased equity attributable to the earnings of dpfc 
a reserve has been recorded in in the amount of million to reflect the estimated loss of the company s entire equity interest in dpfc 
this reserve includes the write off of deferred financing costs in an amount equal to approximately  see certain accounting implications for dpfc 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased in over the comparable period in this decrease was a result of the loss provision on assets held for sale and equity loss of wholly owned financing subsidiary recorded in the company assumes there is no future income tax benefit related to any loss carryforward 
minority interest of limited partners in earnings of investment partnership 
all earned discounts attributable to the former limited partners of dignity viatical had been fully accrued by december  and  therefore  minority interest of limited partners in earnings of investment partnership was zero for compared to  for dignity partners purchased  effective june   the limited partnership interests of the former limited partners for approximately million 
net loss in wholly owned financing subsidiary charged to reserve for equity interest 
in the fourth quarter of  the dpfc net loss of  was included in the company s net loss before income taxes  minority interest and net loss in wholly owned financing subsidiary charged to reserve for equity interest 
this loss was charged against the initial reserve for equity interest in wholly owned financing subsidiary which was recorded in the third quarter of for a description of the composition of such reserve  see loss on investment in wholly owned financing subsidiary above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  earned discounts on life insurance policies 
the company purchased policies with an aggregate face value of million during the year ended december  compared to the purchase of policies with an aggregate face value of million during the purchase of policies during was adversely impacted by capital constraints particularly in the latter half of as compared to the latter half of and rising purchase prices as a result of increased competition during earned discounts on life insurance policies increased from million during to million in  primarily as a result of the company recognizing income over the period on a larger portfolio of policies 
the company began with purchased life insurance policies of million  which was larger than that at the beginning of to a lesser extent  the increase in earned discounts reflected a decrease in the weighted average remaining accrual period of the portfolio of purchased life insurance policies to months at the beginning of from months at the beginning of  accordingly  the earned discount was accrued at a faster rate in than that in competition also resulted in increased purchase prices  thereby reducing the earned discount in relative to the earned discount in on policies with comparable accrual periods 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million for to million for this increase was primarily attributable to increased debt obtained through advances of securitized note proceeds during which were used to fund policy purchases 
in addition  interest rates were generally higher in  though this factor was offset somewhat by the issuance in february of the securitized notes  which bear interest at a fixed rate until  and after  september  compared to a floating interest rate ranging from to applicable to borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility during interest expense increased at a faster rate than the increase in the aggregate cost of policies purchased through december  due to the increased leverage in compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits increased from  for to  for this increase was due to the hiring of additional personnel during to handle the administrative tasks relating to the company s increased portfolio and non broker referral business 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for to the extent the company reviews a policy which it does not purchase  costs associated with the review of the policy  such as fees paid to consultants  are not capitalized  but are expensed as other general and administrative expenses 
during  the company purchased a lower percentage of policies reviewed due to competition and to a smaller percentage of reviewed policies meeting the company s underwriting standards 
as a result  other general and administrative expenses increased disproportionately to the growth in the company s portfolio 
in addition  during  the company purchased more policies originated through non broker sources 
under these circumstances  certain costs traditionally borne by the company s sourcing brokers  such as the costs of obtaining medical records and insurance information  were incurred by the company 
these additional costs were not capitalized even if the policy was purchased and were expensed as other general and administrative expenses 
finally  the company reserved approximately  and incurred an additional  more approximately in legal fees in connection with two dignity viatical collection disputes one of which has been awarded in favor of the company and one of which is on appeal compared to income taxes 
income tax expense increased from  for to  for the increase is primarily the result of the company s increased profitability in relative to minority interest of limited partners in earnings of investment partnership 
the minority interest of limited partners in earnings of investment partnership which is derived primarily from earned discounts on policies acquired by dignity viatical decreased from million for to  for the decrease was due to the timing of the acquisition of policies by dignity viatical and the accrual periods applicable to those policies and hence the recognition of earned discounts on those policies 
the decrease also resulted from incurrence by the company of legal expenses described above under other general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company does not currently have an external funding source 
the securitized notes do not provide funds with which to fund operations 
at december   cash and cash equivalents was million 
the company is analyzing its current and future needs for financing  which will be dependent on its strategic direction 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining external financing on satisfactory terms assuming it determines it needs additional funds 
however  the company at present anticipates having sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital and operational needs through  using the cash generated by the sale of policies as described in asset sales terms of sale agreements and by the partial sale of convertible preferred shares of american information as described in condideration of strategic options 
such needs may change significantly depending on strategic options 
as of december   the outstanding principal amount of the securitized notes was million 
principal repayments on the securitized notes began in july principal repayments on the securitized notes are made from collections on policies pledged to secure the payment thereof and do not require the company to expend cash or obtain financing to satisfy such principal repayments 
description of securitized notes the securitized notes were issued in pursuant to the indenture  which provided for a maximum lending commitment of million  subject to reduction of the commitment amount or early amortization in april if the outstanding principal balance of the securitized notes was less than million 
funds advanced under the securitized notes were used primarily to purchase eligible policies which are pledged as collateral under the indenture 
prior to the amortization date  proceeds from collected policies pledged under the indenture were available to purchase additional policies 
repayments of principal were originally scheduled to begin in september an early amortization event occurred in june with the result that the maximum lending commitment was reduced to the then outstanding balance million from million  the company lost the ability to use proceeds of policy collections to acquire additional policies and principal repayments on the securitized notes began in july the securitized notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 
the principal amount of the securitized notes to be repaid in any month is equal to proceeds of policies collected during the preceding month less certain required monthly payments such as interest and servicing and trustee fees to be paid on such date 
the indenture does not permit the sale of any of the policies pledged thereunder 
an amendment of this prohibition on sales would require the consent of all of the holders of the securitized notes and the company 
the indenture also contains certain covenants restricting the activities of dpfc 
such covenants include provisions which i prohibit dpfc from incurring debt other than trade payables and expense accruals and granting liens unless such action would not cause s p to downgrade or withdraw the rating it assigned to the securitized notes  and ii prohibit dpfc from engaging in any business other than the acquisition  ownership  sale and pledging of the pool and the other trust estate  the issuance and sale of the securitized notes and activities incidental to the foregoing

all amounts owed to the company pursuant to the monitoring and collecting activities are subject to availability of cash after payment of other priority amounts as provided in the indenture 
the servicing agreement contains certain covenants restricting the company s activities  including i restrictions on mergers  ii provisions related to respecting the separate legal status of dpfc  iii a requirement that no person will own a greater percentage of the aggregate voting power of equity securities of the company entitled to vote in the election of directors than the percentage collectively beneficially owned by the executive officers and no person other than the executive officers will own more than of such aggregate voting power  iv a requirement that the executive officers constitute a majority of the board of directors of dignity partners  and v a requirement that the company employ at least two of the executive officers or such other personnel reasonably acceptable to the holders of the securitized notes in their respective current capacities
