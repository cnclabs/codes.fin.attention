net loss as a result of each of the foregoing events  net loss increased from  in to  in the company did not have significant operations in the year ended october  liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations with the net proceeds from a  private placement of the company s series a preferred stock and its initial public offering of  shares of common stock aggregating  after payment of offering costs  approximately  the proceeds have been and will be used to fund construction and development of wireless cable systems  acquisitions of wireless cable frequency rights and development and acquisition of new technologies 
such amount  with interest thereon  is expected to be sufficient to implement the business plan of the company through october  or for a shorter period if the company determines to invest a substantial portion of its assets in major acquisitions or equity investments 
the development of wireless cable systems entails substantial capital investment and will require additional funding 
the future availability and terms of equity and debt financing and of strategic alliances cannot be predicted 
the unavailability or inadequacy of financing to meet future capital needs could force the company to modify  curtail  delay or suspend some or all aspects of its planned operations 
the company has obtained rights to a sufficient number of frequencies in miami  florida to commence development of a wireless cable system when digital technology becomes available on an economic basis 
the company believes that the overall cost of developing such a system in miami would be in excess of  and the initial capital investment required  including acquisition and early phase construction costs  is estimated to be from  to  the actual capital investment requirements for developing any markets may vary substantially from such estimates depending upon which frequencies are actually acquired  the technical configuration of the transmission systems  and regulatory issues 
the balance of the required capital will be invested as subscribers are added 
there can be no assurance that the company can develop the miami market  and  as discussed below  the company may seek to sell its rights to the miami market 
the company has capitalized the costs of obtaining the rights to wireless frequencies in the miami market 
the recoverability of such costs is dependent upon the successful development of a system in miami or through the resale of such frequency rights 
management estimates that it will recover the carrying amount of these costs from cash flows generated by the system once it has been developed 
however  it is reasonably possible that such estimate will change in the near term as a result of frequency availability  technology  regulatory or other changes 
development of markets in which the company has already acquired rights  including acquisition of the additional frequencies and other related assets which may be necessary to make development feasible  would use substantially all its capital 
the company also plans to acquire additional  as yet unidentified wireless frequencies or assets  however  there can be no assurance it will be able to acquire any of them 
if it does not sell its interest in the miami market  as discussed below  the company plans to use its assets to develop miami  the market which management considers most promising at present  and will seek additional capital to develop miami and other markets in which it may acquire interests through equity or debt financing  joint ventures or other arrangements 
the company does not currently have such financing or joint venture partners in place 
based on the experience of its management in other markets  the company believes such financing will be available  especially for the incremental capital needed as a system adds revenue producing subscribers  however  there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing or partners on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms and conditions  if at all 
in some cases  the company may sell frequencies to finance development or acquisition of other markets 
the failure to obtain additional funds on a timely basis could have a material adverse affect on the company and its business and  if such financing is not available  the company may be obliged to modify or curtail its operations 
the company believes it will be able to undertake limited development of miami that is  with less rapid construction and less extensive marketing without such additional financing or partners and still have available capital to finance local operators that wish to enter strategic alliances with the company and make other acquisitions or investments 
the company is continuing discussions with bellsouth corporation for the sale of its subsidiary  sftv  with all of the company s wireless cable assets in the miami area  to bellsouth for million in bellsouth stock 
the transaction is subject to completion of due diligence and negotiation of definitive agreements 
there can be no assurance that such agreements will be entered into or that the transaction can be completed as proposed
