item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s revenues are derived primarily from service charges on pawn loans and the sale of unredeemed goods  or merchandise sales 
loans are made for a day term with an automatic extension of days in texas  days in oklahoma and days in maryland 
loans made in washington  dc are made for a day term with no automatic extension 
all loans are collateralized by tangible personal property placed in the custody of the company 
the annualized service charge rates on the loans are set by state laws and range between and in texas and and in oklahoma  depending on the size of the loan 
service charge rates are to on an annualized basis in maryland  with a monthly minimum charge 
in washington  dc  loans up to bear a flat charge per month  while loans over bear a annualized rate 
in its texas stores  the company recognizes service charges at the inception of the loan at the lesser of the amount allowed by the state law for the initial day term or  in accordance with state law 
in oklahoma  maryland and washington  dc  the company recognizes service charges at the inception of the loan at the amount allowed by law for the first days 
pawn service charge income applicable to the remaining term and or extension period is not recognized until the loan is repaid or renewed 
if a loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the automatic extension period  if applicable  the property is forfeited to the company and held for resale 
as a result of the company s policy of accruing pawn service charges only for the initial day term  unredeemed merchandise is transferred to inventory at a value equal to the loan principal plus one month s accrued interest 
the company s accounting policy defers recognition of an amount of income equal to the amount of pawn service charges relating to the extension period until the loan is repaid or renewed  or until the merchandise is resold 
as a result of this policy  the company s annualized loan yield is lower than certain of its publicly traded competitors 
conversely  this revenue recognition policy results in inventory being recorded at a lower value  which results in realization of a larger gross profit margin on merchandise sales than would be realized by certain of the company s publicly traded competitors 
this policy  in the company s opinion  lessens the risk that the inventory s cost will exceed its realizable value when sold 
however  if the pawn loan is repaid or renewed  or if the forfeited merchandise is resold  the amount of income which would be recognized by the company or certain of its publicly traded competitors would be the same over time 
although the company has had significant increases in revenues due primarily to acquisitions and secondarily to new store openings  the company has also incurred increases in operating expenses attributable to the additional stores and increases in administrative expenses attributable to building a management team and the support personnel required by the company s growth 
operating expenses consist of all items directly related to the operation of the company s stores  including salaries and related payroll costs  rent  utilities  equipment depreciation  advertising  property taxes  licenses  supplies and security 
administrative expenses consist of items relating to the operation of the corporate office  including the salaries of corporate officers  area supervisors and other management  accounting and administrative costs  liability and casualty insurance  outside legal and accounting fees and stockholder related expenses

liquidity and capital resources the company s operations and acquisitions during the past three years have been financed with funds generated from operations  bank borrowings  and seller financed indebtedness 
the company maintains a  long term line of credit with bank one  texas  na the credit facility 
at july    was outstanding under this credit facility and an additional  was available to the company pursuant to the available borrowing base 
the credit facility bears interest at the prevailing libor rate plus one and three quarters percent  and matures in december amounts available under the credit facility are limited to the sum of of inventory and of loans and service charges receivable of the company 
the credit facility is scheduled to mature on december  under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain technical covenants 
as of july   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
the company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of of on the average daily unused portion of the credit facility commitment 
the company is prohibited from paying dividends to its stockholders 
substantially all of the unencumbered assets of the company have been pledged as collateral against indebtedness under the credit facility 
in september and october  the company acquired four individual stores in its mid atlantic division  in december the company acquired one store in the dallas  texas area  in february the company acquired one store in corpus christi  texas  and in march the company acquired one store in bladensburg  maryland 
these asset purchases were made for an aggregate purchase price of  consisting of cash paid to the sellers of  and legal  consulting and other fees of  these acquisitions were financed with proceeds from the company s credit facility and acquisition term notes provided by the company s primary lender 
the purchase price for these acquisitions was determined based upon the volume of annual loan and sales transactions  outstanding loan balances  inventory on hand  and location and condition of the facilities 
as of july   the company s primary sources of liquidity were  in cash and cash equivalents   in service charge receivables   in loans   in inventories and  of available and unused funds under the company s credit facility 
the company had working capital as of july  of  and a liabilities to equity ratio of to net cash provided by operating activities of the company during fiscal was  consisting primarily of net income before non cash depreciation and amortization of  less cash used to fund the increase of balance sheet items of  net cash used for investing activities during fiscal was  which was comprised of cash used for increasing pawn loans of  and cash paid for acquisitions and other fixed asset additions of  during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was  during fiscal  which consisted of net increases in the company s debt and repurchase of outstanding stock warrants of  supplemented by cash provided from the exercise of stock options and warrants of  the profitability and liquidity of the company is affected by the amount of loans outstanding  which is controlled in part by the company s loan decisions 
the company is able to influence the frequency of forfeiture of collateral by increasing or decreasing the amount loaned in relation to the resale value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller loans in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate loan balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service charges 
additionally  small loans in relation to the pledged property s estimated resale value tends to increase loan redemptions and improve the company s liquidity 
conversely  providing larger loans in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property can result in an increase in the company s pawn service charge income 
also larger average loan balances can result in an increase in loan forfeitures  which increases the quantity of goods on hand and  unless the company increases inventory turnover  reduces the company s liquidity 
in each of the company s last three fiscal years  at least of the amounts loaned were either paid in full or renewed  and it is management s current intent to maintain this ratio 
the company s renewal policy allows customers to renew pawn loans by repaying all accrued interest on such pawn loans  effectively creating a new loan transaction 
in addition to these factors  the company s liquidity is affected by merchandise sales and the pace of store expansions 
management believes that the credit facility  current assets and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the company s current operations for fiscal the company has no significant capital commitments as of october  the company currently has no written commitments for additional borrowings or future acquisitions  however  the company intends to continue to grow and will likely seek additional capital to facilitate expansion 
the company will evaluate acquisitions  if any  based upon opportunities  acceptable financing  purchase price  strategic fit and qualified management personnel 
the company currently intends to continue to engage in a plan of expansion through existing store acquisitions and new store openings 
while the company continually looks for  and is presented with  potential acquisition candidates  the company has no definitive plans or commitments for further acquisitions 
the company has no immediate plans to open any other new stores 
if the company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire or open a new store in the near future  the company will seek additional financing  the terms of which will be negotiated on a case by case basis 
between august  and october   the company acquired three individual stores for an aggregate purchase price of  which was financed with proceeds from the company s credit facility
