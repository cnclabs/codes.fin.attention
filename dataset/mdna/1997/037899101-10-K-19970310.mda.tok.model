as of december   the company held liquid assets totaling  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility  however  standby letters of credit issued under the facility totaling  were outstanding as of december  inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially affected its operating results during the past three years 
a majority of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
an increase in the minimum wage has recently been passed by the federal government and is also being discussed by various state governments 
although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at its restaurants
