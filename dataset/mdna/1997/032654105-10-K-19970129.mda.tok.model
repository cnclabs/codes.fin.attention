item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the company reported net sales of  million in fiscal  up million or from net sales of million in fiscal fiscal year sales growth was attributable to significant increases in sales volumes of both the company s standard linear ic and system level ic products as worldwide demand for precision integrated circuit products continued to increase in the first half of fiscal during the third and fourth quarters a broad based inventory correction by end users  customers and distributors in response to the shorter lead times available for many products from the company and other suppliers caused sales levels to be flat with the second quarter 
demand for the company s ics was strong both in its core industrial and instrumentation markets and in high growth applications in the communications  computer and portable wireless equipment markets 
total ic sales  representing both standard linear and system level ics  constituted approximately of total sales in fiscal  continuing the long term trend of ic sales being a major portion of the company s revenues 
sales of the company s standard linear ic products  which continues to make up the largest and most profitable part of the company s business  increased in fiscal to million 
standard linear ic sales  however  declined as a percentage of total sales  accounting for of total sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting the significant revenue growth experienced in the system level ic business 
the growth in sales of standard linear ics continues to be driven by the greater use of standard linear ic products in new high volume applications in wireless and broadband communications  computer and consumer markets including digital cellular handsets and base stations  video applications and imaging applications 
in fiscal  the distributor channel continued to be a significant growth channel for the company s standard linear ic product line 
sales of system level ics increased in fiscal to million  as the company achieved substantial gains in its general purpose digital signal processing products and mixed signal ics for application specific system on a chip solutions 
the largest end user market growth for the company s system level ic products was experienced in wireless communications applications  including digital mobile phones and base stations 
as a percentage of total sales  system level ic products  increased to of total sales compared to in fiscal sales of the company s assembled products decreased approximately million or from fiscal to fiscal and as a percentage of total sales decreased from to over this same period 
the company believes this sales decrease reflects the decline in the market opportunities for this product line 
in fiscal  sales to north american customers followed the trend of the prior year and increased million or over fiscal to million 
sales to customers outside north america  primarily europe and southeast asia  increased million or to million 
sales to european customers increased million or to million  with much of this growth resulting from the company s increased penetration of applications in the communications market  particularly in handsets and base stations used in the gsm global system for mobile communications digital cellular telephone system now widely deployed in western europe 
sales in japan increased slightly by to million largely as a result of a reduction in sales of standard linear ic products for factory automation and other industrial market applications and the weaker japanese industrial economy 
a strengthening average us dollar exchange rate also contributed to the lack of growth in japanese sales 
sales to customers in southeast asia increased or million to million compared to fiscal due to increased demand for products in the hard disk drive  communications and computer products segments 
as a percentage of total sales  north american and international sales accounted for and  respectively  compared to and in fiscal in fiscal the distributor channel was a major contributor to sales growth in north america as well as in europe and japan  especially for standard linear ic and dsp products 
worldwide sales through distribution increased approximately from fiscal to fiscal and represented of the company s total sales 
worldwide oem sales increased by approximately and represented of the company s sales 
during fiscal the company continued the multi faceted manufacturing capacity expansion program started in to substantially increase the number of fabricated wafers available to it in fiscal and beyond 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of the company s actions to address its capacity issues 
gross margin was of sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal the reduction in gross margin was principally due to a lower proportion of standard linear ic products in the mix of products sold  which generally have higher gross margins than the company s system level ic products 
the reduction in gross margin in fiscal was also attributable to the increase in capacity combined with the leveling off of sales in the latter half of the year 
research and development expenses increased approximately in fiscal to million or of sales 
this increase was mainly due to the continued development of innovative slic products and processes and higher spending in the development of new products and technologies targeted for the communications  computer and automotive markets  including initiatives in general purpose digital signal processing such as the company s sharc product family  system level ics for computer audio and wireless communications applications  rf signal processing  surface micromachining technology  accelerometer products 
the increase in r d expenditures in fiscal was also attributable to increased staffing of design engineering personnel and the start up of new design centers 
the company believes that technical leadership in the semiconductor industry is critical to its future success and is committed to maintaining a high level of research and development effort 
selling  marketing  general and administrative smg a expense growth in fiscal was held to  as smg a increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal smg a expenses continued to decline as a percentage of sales to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal  consistent with the company s goal of constraining smg a spending growth to a rate significantly below sales growth 
the increase in smg a expenses in absolute dollars was primarily related to higher incentive expenses associated with improved revenue and profitability levels  and greater product advertising and related promotional costs and commissions in support of the company s product lines and customer base 
operating income grew to of sales compared to of sales in fiscal this performance gain reflected the combination of accelerated demand for the company s products and continuing commitment to growing expenses more slowly than sales 
nonoperating income of million in fiscal improved to million in fiscal interest expense in fiscal increased from fiscal as a result of the issuance of  of convertible subordinated notes in december but this increase was more than offset by increased investment income as a result of the positive spread between the coupon rate and the investment rates achieved on available cash balances through fiscal the effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to earnings growth in higher tax rate jurisdictions including the us the company maintained a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million at november  based on management s assessment that realization of such deferred tax assets was not assured for book and tax capital losses 
the valuation allowance balance was million at october  the net change in the valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended november  was a decrease of million as a result of the utilization of book basis foreign tax credits and the use of capital tax loss carryforwards 
the growth in sales  improved operating performance and lower nonoperating expenses yielded a increase in net income to million or of sales compared to million or of sales 
earnings per share in fiscal grew to from in fiscal the company has not yet adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation which will require adoption in fiscal the company does not believe the adoption of these statements will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
the impact of inflation on the company s business during the past three years has not been significant 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales of million for fiscal increased from net sales of million for fiscal the sales increase was due to higher sales volumes of standard linear ic and system level ic products which comprise approximately of total sales for fiscal standard linear ic sales rose million or to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the combination of increased penetration of the company s data converter and amplifier products in high performance instrumentation and factory automation applications and greater use of standard linear ic products in new high volume applications in the communications  computer and consumer markets including digital cellular handsets and base stations  video and imaging applications 
sales of system level ic products grew million or to million in fiscal this growth was attributable largely to increased demand for applications in personal computers and wireless communications products including digital mobile phones and base stations  and the company s broader participation in these growing markets 
sales of assembled products declined approximately from fiscal to fiscal and as a percentage of total sales decreased from to over the same period 
sales to north american customers increased over fiscal levels to million with much of this increase coming from the distributor channel as sales through north american distributors increased from the prior year 
sales to international customers grew led by sales increases of approximately and in japan and europe  respectively 
sales growth in japan was mainly attributable to increased demand for standard linear ic products  and the weaker us dollar exchange rate also contributed to some of the sales improvement in japan 
the sales increase in europe represented continued strength in sales of products in the communications markets  particularly in handsets and base stations used in gsm digital cellular telephone systems 
southeast asia sales of million for fiscal were flat compared to the prior year due to significant decline in hard disk drive sales 
as a percentage of total net sales  north american and international sales remained at and  respectively  which were comparable to fiscal gross margin improved to of sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase was principally due to a higher proportion of standard linear ic products in the mix of products sold which typically generate higher gross margins than the company s system level ic products 
the fiscal improvement in gross margin was also attributable to greater capacity utilization  resulting in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs over increased production levels 
r d expenses for fiscal increased from fiscal as the company continued to invest in new product development 
as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  marketing  general and administrative smg a expense growth was held to compared to fiscal  increasing at a lower rate than sales 
as a result  smg a as a percentage of sales decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in smg a expenses related mostly to increased incentive expenses associated with improved revenue and profitability levels and greater product advertising and related promotional costs in support of the company s product lines and customers 
in total  operating expenses were reduced to of sales  down from in fiscal  consistent with the company s emphasis on maintaining tight control over all costs in order to gain better operating leverage on increases in revenues 
operating income reached of sales for fiscal  an increase of percentage points from of sales for fiscal this performance gain reflected the higher sales level  improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales and slower rate of expense growth versus sales 
nonoperating expenses decreased million in fiscal  benefiting from a reduction in interest expense of million and an increase in interest income of million for the year 
the maturity of a term loan of million in early fiscal and on average higher cash balances invested at a higher weighted average investment rate were the main causes of the change over fiscal the effective income tax rate increased to approximately in fiscal from approximately in fiscal due to a shift in the mix of worldwide income 
the company maintained a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million at both october  and october  based on management s assessment that realization of such deferred tax assets was not assured for book and tax capital losses and book basis foreign tax credits 
the growth in sales  improved operating performance and lower nonoperating expenses resulted in a increase in net income to million or of sales in fiscal compared to million or of sales in fiscal earnings per share in fiscal grew to from in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at november   the company had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at october  the company s operating activities generated net cash of million  or of sales  and million  or of sales  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
investing activities used million in fiscal and million in fiscal while financing activities generated million in fiscal and used million in fiscal working capital increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and higher receivable and inventory associated with the expanded scale of operations 
the company s primary source of funds in fiscal year was net cash generated by operations  but in fiscal year the primary source of funding was from financing  the major item being the issuance of long term convertible debt which generated net proceeds of million 
there was a million reduction in operating cash flows from million in fiscal to million fiscal net income was higher in fiscal by million but this increase was offset by increases in receivables and inventory which were only partially offset by increases in depreciation and various liability accounts 
the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization expense was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as a result of internal capacity expansion  depreciation expense is expected to be higher in fiscal as these additions continue to ramp up 
accounts receivable of million at the end of fiscal increased million or from million at the end of fiscal this increase was caused by an increase in revenue and non linearity of shipments at the year end 
as a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales  accounts receivable was at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal inventories rose million or over the prior year to million at the end of fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in standard linear inventory levels needed to service increasing sales volumes and to offset unusually low inventory levels at the end of fiscal caused by the capacity shortages at that time and to improve customer response times 
additional manufacturing capacity during fiscal also caused inventory levels to increase 
accordingly  year end inventories as a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal accounts payable and accrued liabilities remained essentially flat at approximately million at the end of both fiscal and  as increases caused by increased expense activity related to the higher revenue level were offset by reductions in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of fiscal when compared to the year earlier period 
the company s principal investment activities during fiscal were in support of its manufacturing capacity expansion programs and included capital expenditures of million and an investment of million which was an installment on an share in a wafer fabrication facility on a joint venture basis with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and a further investment of approximately million in chartered semiconductor manufacturing  pte 
ltd 
in singapore 
capital expenditures in fiscal  of million  were million higher than in fiscal with a significant portion of these expenditures related to the construction of additional manufacturing capacity including further development of the six inch wafer fabrication plant at the company s limerick manufacturing facility 
also during fiscal  the company continued to upgrade its existing wilmington  massachusetts wafer fabrication facility from four inch to six inch wafer production 
this additional capacity became available in the latter half of fiscal  and is used primarily for high speed linear products 
in addition  the company continued development of the six inch wafer fabrication module located in sunnyvale  california 
this six inch facility is being upgraded and modernized and a cbcmos process is currently being developed 
production was scheduled to start in late but because of the slowdown in demand  production is temporarily delayed 
the company also signed an agreement to lease a wafer fabrication facility in cambridge  massachusetts and is upgrading this facility which will be used for the production of the accelerometer and other micromachined products 
the company also expanded assembly and test facilities in the philippines during fiscal by adding a new site which is expected to commence production in early in june  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with tsmc  two other companies and several individual investors for the construction and operation of a semiconductor fabrication facility in camas  washington 
the company acquired an equity ownership in the joint venture  known as wafertech  in return for a million investment 
the investment is to be made in three installments of which the first and second were made on june  and december  both in the amount of million 
the remaining installment of million is due on november  in fiscal  the company made an equity investment of million in chartered semiconductor manufacturing pte  ltd 
csm in singapore and in fiscal the company made an additional investment of approximately million  in exchange for less than ownership interest 
in fiscal  the company entered into a supply agreement with its primary wafer foundry  tsmc 
under this agreement  the company agreed to make a series of advance payments to tsmc aggregating million  payable over a three year period  in order to secure access to a minimum level of wafer capacity over the period from to however  during fiscal the arrangement was modified whereby the company would maintain a constant deposit of million with tsmc 
in january  the company entered into an additional agreement with csm  whereby the company will provide a total deposit of approximately million to be paid in several installments in and in fiscal million was provided to csm under this arrangement and is classified in the balance sheet line item  deferred charges and other assets 
under the terms of this agreement  the deposit will guarantee access to certain quantities of sub micron wafers through fiscal if the company does not purchase the minimum quantities under the agreement  the deposit will be forfeited for the value of the wafer shortfall up to the total amount of million 
at the end of the agreement term  the company s deposit will be returned  net of any forfeitures 
the company currently plans to make capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  primarily in connection with the continued expansion of its manufacturing capacity 
financing activities in fiscal generated cash of million from the issuance of long term convertible debt  million from equipment financing and million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
cash used in the company s financing activities in fiscal was for the repayment of million of variable rate borrowings and million for the repayment of capital lease obligations 
at november   the company s principal sources of liquidity included million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
short term investments at the end of fiscal consisted of commercial paper  certificates of deposit and euro time deposits with maturities greater than three months and less than six months at the time of acquisition 
the company also has various lines of credit both in the us and overseas  including a million credit facility in the us which expires in  all of which were substantially unused at the end of fiscal at the end of fiscal  the company s debt to equity ratio was 
on december   the company completed a public offering of  of five year convertible subordinated notes due december  with semi annual interest payments on june and december of each year  commencing june  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into the company s common stock at any time unless previously redeemed by the company  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million after payment of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering which will be amortized over the term of the notes 
the company believes that its existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with current and anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and research and development efforts for the foreseeable future 
litigation as set forth in item business legal proceedings  the company is no longer engaged in an enforcement proceeding brought by the international trade commission itc related to previously settled patent infringement litigation with texas instruments  inc however  the itc has referred certain related matters to the department of justice 
the company is unable to determine what  if any  action may be taken by the department of justice  but the company plans to vigorously defend itself in the event that any enforcement action is taken by the department of justice on any of the matters referred to it by the itc 
factors which may affect future results the company s future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by the company and its competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity  changes in product mix and economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
in addition  the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times 
during the past six months demand for the company s product has leveled off  and the company has used this opportunity to replenish inventory which had been depleted in the prior year 
these higher inventory levels expose the company to the risk of obsolescence depending on the mix of future business 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company s success depends in part on its continued ability to develop and market new products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that such products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  the company s growth is dependent on its continued ability to penetrate new markets such as the communications  computer and automotive segments of the electronics market  where the company has limited experience and competition is intense 
there can be no assurance that the markets being served by the company will grow in the future  that the company s existing and new products will meet the requirements of such markets  that the company s products will achieve customer acceptance in such markets  that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from the company  or that the company can achieve or maintain profits in these markets 
also  some of the customers in these markets are less well established which could subject the company to increased credit risk 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive 
certain of the company s competitors have greater technical  marketing  manufacturing and financial resources than the company 
the company s competitors also include emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets such as those served by the company 
competitors of the company have  in some cases  developed and marketed products having similar design and functionality as the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that the company s operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
during fiscal  the company increased substantially its manufacturing capacity through both expansion of its production facilities and increased access to third party foundries  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either its own facilities or at third party foundries  or that the increased capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for its products 
the company relies  and plans to continue to rely  on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of its wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard digital processes  and such reliance involves several risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
in addition  the company s capacity additions will result in a significant increase in operating expenses  and if revenue levels do not increase to offset these additional expense levels  the company s future operating results could be adversely affected  including the potential adverse impact in operating results for take or pay covenants in certain of its supply agreements 
with its greater capacity relative to demand  the company has increased its levels of inventory 
the company s business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before they are utilized by the company 
the company also believes that other semiconductor manufacturers are also expanding or planning to expand their production capacity over the next several years  and there can be no assurance that the expansion by the company and its competitors will not lead to overcapacity in the company s target markets  which could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect the company s operating results 
for fiscal  of the company s revenues were derived from customers in international markets 
the company has manufacturing facilities in ireland  the philippines and taiwan 
the company is therefore subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations  including expropriation  air transportation disruptions  currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates  tax and tariff rates and freight rates 
although the company engages in certain hedging transactions to reduce its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  there can be no assurance that the company s competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company has from time to time received  and may in the future receive  claims from third parties asserting that the company s products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim and a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents or other intellectual property rights of the company or to defend the company against claims of infringement  and such litigation can be costly and divert the attention of key personnel 
see item legal proceedings for information concerning pending litigation involving the company 
an adverse outcome in such litigation  may  in certain cases  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or on its consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by analysts or other events
