average shares outstanding         as a percentage of net sales net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense net income loss the company s business  as well as the sales demand for various types of boats  tends to be highly seasonal 
strong sales typically begin in january with the onset of the public boat and recreation shows  and continue through july 
over the previous four year period  the average annual net sales for the quarterly periods ended march and june represented in excess of and  respectively  of the company s annual net sales 
with regard to net income  the company historically generates profits in three of its fiscal quarters and experiences operating losses in the quarter ended december due to a broad seasonal slowdown in sales 
during the quarter ended september  inventory typically reaches its lowest levels and accumulated cash reserves reach the highest levels 
during the quarter ended december  the company generally builds inventory levels in preparation for the upcoming selling season which begins with boat and recreation shows occurring during january through march in certain market areas in which the company conducts business 
travis boats operating results would be materially and adversely affected if net sales were to fall significantly below historical levels during the months of january through june 
the company s business is also significantly affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions that are unseasonable or unusual may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
for example  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels  as well as excessive rain  may affect the company s sale of boating packages and related products and accessories 
while management believes that the company s quarterly net sales will continue to be impacted by seasonality  quarterly results may become less susceptible to certain regional weather conditions as expansion occurs throughout the southern united states 
quarterly results may fluctuate as a result of the expenses associated with new store openings or acquisitions 
the company  prior to fiscal  had attempted to concentrate expansion during the seasonal slowdown generally occurring in the quarter ending december during fiscal  the company modified its acquisition strategy to acquire store locations through out the fiscal year 
this was done to allow the company the opportunity to derive in season sales from the acquisitions as well as to provide a longer period in which to integrate the acquired store s operations 
accordingly  the results for any quarterly period may not be indicative of the expected results for any other quarterly period 
year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four for example  for to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year in some cases  the new date will cause computers to stop operating  while in other cases  incorrect output may result 
since the company is currently in the process of replacing and upgrading its computer hardware and software systems  the company believes that there is little business risk attributable to the year issue
