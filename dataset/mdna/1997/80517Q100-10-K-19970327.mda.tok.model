btg manages its israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the bank of israel s monetary policy is to manage the exchange rate while allowing the consumer price index to rise by approximately in  in and in for those expenses linked to the israeli shekel  such as salaries and rent  this resulted in corresponding increases in these costs in us dollars 
in  and  the shekel was devalued by approximately  and  respectively  against the us dollar 
because of the insignificant devaluation of the shekel against the us dollar despite the annual rate of increase in the consumer price index  btg s costs of local goods and services  to the extent linked in whole or in part to the consumer price index  increased in us dollar terms 
to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition 
however  should btg s revenues in shekels exceed its expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel will adversely affect btg s financial condition 
further  to the extent the devaluation of the shekel with respect to the us dollar does not substantially offset the increase in the costs of local goods and services in israel  btg s financial results will be adversely affected as local expenses measured in us dollars will increase 
there can be no assurance that the government of israel will continue to devalue the shekel from time to time to offset the effects of inflation in israel

the company believes that its remaining cash resources as of december   together with anticipated product sales  scheduled payments to be made to btg under its current agreements with pharmaceutical partners and third parties  the proceeds from sales of equity and continued funding from the chief scientist at current levels  will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding at current levels  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
the satisfaction of the company s future cash requirements will depend in large part on the status of commercialization of the company s products  the company s ability to enter into additional research and development and licensing arrangements  and the company s ability to obtain additional equity investments  if necessary 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  that such funding will be on favorable terms 
in addition  the indentures under which the company s debt securities were issued limit the ability of the company to satisfy its cash requirements through borrowings or the issuance of debt securities 
the company continues to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements  in order to provide revenue from sales of certain products and funding for a portion of the research and development expenses relating to the products covered  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such agreements
