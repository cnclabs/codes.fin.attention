item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company has pursued an active acquisition program designed to take advantage of consolidation opportunities in the widely fragmented foundry industry 
the company has acquired fourteen foundries since its inception 
as a result of these completed transactions as well as internal growth  the company s net sales have increased from approximately million for its first full fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  as an important part of the company s growth strategy  the company evaluates on an ongoing basis potential industry related acquisitions 
while the company has not at the present time entered into any definitive agreement contemplating any such acquisition  the company is currently in various stages of negotiations with potential acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when any such negotiations will ultimately culminate in a definitive agreement or  if a definitive agreement is reached  whether any such acquisition will ultimately be consummated 
to complete any such acquisition  the company may use its revolving credit facility 
in the event that no further borrowings are available under the revolving credit facility  the company would consider other financing alternatives available at that time 
due to the large size of certain orders  the timing for deliveries of orders and the number and types of castings produced  the company s net sales and net income may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter 
generally  the first fiscal quarter is seasonally weaker than the other quarters as a result of plant shutdowns for maintenance at most of the company s foundries as well as at many customers plants 
see supplemental quarterly information 
during july  flooding of the missouri river halted production of the company s atchison  kansas foundry for four weeks  negatively impacting operating results 
although the company was able to resume production at the atchison facility without a significant loss of existing orders  the flood has had a continuing negative effect on productivity and sales due to increased equipment maintenance  production downtime and employee overtime 
the company constructed a flood wall surrounding the atchison facility that the company believes has significantly reduced the risk of future flood damage 
following the flood  the company was unable to renew its flood insurance coverage at reasonable rates for this facility
