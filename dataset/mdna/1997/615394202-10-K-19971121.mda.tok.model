item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading worldwide designer and manufacturer of a broad range of high performance  precision motion and fluid control products and systems for aerospace and industrial markets 
moog s servoactuation systems are critical to the flight control of commercial and military aircraft  positioning satellites  controlling the thrust of space launch vehicles  steering tactical and strategic missiles  and a wide variety of hydraulic and electric industrial applications requiring the precise control of position  velocity and force 
the company has two segments  domestic controls and international controls 
domestic controls primarily focuses on north american markets  with the majority of its sales in aerospace related product lines 
international controls is focused on markets in europe and the asian pacific  with the majority of sales in industrial product lines 
the company has five principal product lines 
aerospace controls includes commercial aircraft  satellites and launch vehicles and military aircraft 
industrial controls includes industrial hydraulics and industrial electrics controls 
the commercial aircraft product line provides servovalves and flight controls for boeing  airbus and regional jet aircraft 
the satellites and launch vehicles product line includes satellite positioning controls and steering controls for launch vehicles  strategic missiles and tactical missiles 
the military aircraft product line provides primary and secondary flight controls and engine controls for advanced fighters  helicopters and bomber aircraft 
industrial hydraulics controls principally consist of servovalves used in various applications including plastic injection and blow molding  steam and gas turbines  steel rolling mills and fatigue testing machines 
the industrial electrics product line includes motion simulators  controls for gun and turret positioning on military ground vehicles and electric drives 
in each product line  significant revenues are generated through aftermarket sales  including spares and repairs 
the company considers strategic acquisitions to enhance market share or improve engineering and manufacturing capability 
on october   the company acquired the assets of and assumed certain liabilities related to the industrial hydraulic servocontrols business the us industrial hydraulics business of international motion control inc  an unrelated third party  for million 
the us industrial hydraulics business  which operated under the name moog controls inc  was spun off by the company in february the acquisition was principally financed with proceeds from the company s us revolving credit and term loan facility the bank credit facility 
sales aerospace and industrial controls sales were and of sales  respectively 
in aerospace controls  the company s sales are dependent on commercial aircraft demand  procurement and spending levels on various military programs and the demand for satellites serving the telecommunications and direct broadcasting industries 
in industrial controls  the company is subject to changes in capital goods spending cycles in regional markets 
the company s sales in each product category are subject to different short and long term cycles  however  the impact of cyclicality in sales is mitigated by the diversity of the product lines and the company s broad global distribution capabilities 
sales of aerospace controls are typically pursuant to long term contracts for which the company uses the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting 
under this method  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred 
estimates of the cost to complete the contracts are performed on a regular basis 
on contracts for which the estimated factory cost is higher than the contract s value  a charge to earnings is made  and a loss reserve created 
the company believes that adequate reserves have been established 
international controls sales were approximately of consolidated sales 
results of operations can be affected in us dollar terms by the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates 
exposure to currency movements can be mitigated by the number of countries in which the company operates 
although the company does not hedge the operating results of its international operations  it selectively hedges certain balance sheet exposures 
spare parts and repairs are aggressively marketed directly to the company s aerospace and industrial controls customers 
sales of spare parts and repairs are generally more profitable and less volatile than oem sales 
aftermarket sales were approximately of and sales 
over the past five years  government sales  as a percentage of total sales  has declined as the company has increased its focus on the development and acquisition of commercial aircraft and industrial controls product lines 
in  government sales were of consolidated net sales compared to in the mix of commercial and government sales is not expected to materially shift in the near future 
cost of sales the principal elements of cost of sales are direct labor  raw materials and manufacturing overhead 
the company has a highly skilled workforce and an infrastructure of engineering and related support costs 
the business requires significant investments in capital equipment  buildings and related support costs 
cost of sales can be significantly affected by changes in both volume and product mix 
accordingly  short term changes in volume can have a significant effect on gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are generally higher in industrial controls compared to aerospace controls 
typically  industrial controls has higher gross profit margins  while requiring higher sales and support efforts 
accordingly  shifts in the sales mix to or from industrial controls will generally affect total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
for aerospace controls  selling  general and administrative expenses are also affected by the extent of bid and proposal work on long term programs 
research and development research and development expenses can vary depending on whether the engineering staff is engaged in customer funded design and development activities or company funded design and development activities 
annual company funded research and development expenses have averaged million over the past five years 
sales related to customer funded design and development have averaged million  or of sales  from to the decline in customer funded design and development costs in reflects the transition of certain long term military programs from the development phase to production 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate reflects differing tax rates of the various countries in which it conducts its business 
variations in where the company earns income can have an impact on the effective tax rate 
fiscal year effective in fiscal  the company changed its fiscal year end from september to the last saturday in september september  for fiscal 
the impact on results of operations was not material 
moog inc results of operations fiscal years ended september  september  september  dollars in thousands domestic controls net sales aerospace    industrial    intersegment sales    total sales    operating profit    backlog    international controls net sales aerospace    industrial    intersegment sales    total sales    operating profit    backlog    consolidated net sales aerospace    industrial    operating profit    net earnings    backlog    compared with consolidated net sales for were million compared with million in the sales improvement is due to increases of million in industrial controls and million in aerospace controls 
the increase in industrial controls resulted primarily from the acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business  which added approximately million in revenues during  and to a lesser extent  increased demand for entertainment simulators 
industrial controls sales increases in europe and the asian pacific were more than offset by exchange rate fluctuations  particularly in germany and japan 
the effect on industrial controls sales of the decline in the value of the applicable foreign currencies relative to the us dollar was approximately in compared to  or approximately million 
the sales improvement in aerospace controls resulted primarily from increased volume in the commercial aircraft product line and  to a lesser extent  the satellites and launch vehicles product line  tempered by expected declines in military aircraft 
cost of sales for was of net sales  which is comparable to increased volume and product mix in aerospace controls had a favorable effect of approximately million on consolidated cost of sales 
the improved aerospace controls gross margin was offset by unfavorable product mix and adverse changes in foreign currencies in industrial controls  in particular germany  and  to a lesser extent  costs incurred to improve the longer term margins of industrial electrics 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in  compared to million  or of net sales  in the decrease as a percentage of sales is principally due to growth in sales 
interest expense increased by million to million in  as compared to  due primarily to additional indebtedness incurred for the october acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business 
the tax rate of primarily reflects benefits resulting from the distribution of earnings from the german subsidiary and tax incentives associated with us export sales 
other income decreased by 
million to million in as included 
million of license fees received on a foreign military program 
other expense in includes 
million of the company s share of costs associated with the start up phase of a joint venture that manufactures and markets manifolds for oem machinery  as well as losses associated with disposals of assets 
results in include a 
million extraordinary loss  net of income tax benefit  on the early repayment of debt 
as a result of the previously mentioned factors  net earnings for increased to million  or per share  compared with million  or per share in domestic controls domestic controls net sales increased by to million in compared to million in sales of industrial controls increased by million primarily due to the october acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business 
in addition  increased sales of entertainment motion simulators of approximately million contributed to the higher sales of industrial controls 
sales of aerospace controls increased by million in due to growing commercial aircraft and satellites and launch vehicles demand 
sales of flight controls for commercial aircraft to boeing increased approximately from a year ago 
the demand for cellular phones  pagers and direct to home television has resulted in increased sales of controls for communication related satellites and launch vehicles 
these increases were in part offset by expected sales declines of approximately million in the military aircraft product line as certain programs  particularly the f a super hornet and v osprey  were transitioning from the development phase to low rate initial production 
operating profit for the domestic controls segment was up to million for  or of segment sales 
this compares with million  or of segment sales a year ago 
approximately half of the increase was attributable to higher aerospace controls sales  in addition to a more favorable product mix in commercial and military aircraft controls 
industrial controls accounted for the remainder of the domestic controls operating profit increase primarily due to the acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business 
backlog for the domestic controls segment was million at september  compared with million at september  the increase from a year ago is due to low rate initial production orders received on the f a super hornet  v osprey and standard missile programs  growth in orders for entertainment simulators and the acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business 
backlog consists of that portion of open orders for which sales are expected to be recognized over the next twelve months 
international controls international controls net sales for of million were flat as compared to net sales of million despite lower average currency values 
excluding the changes in currency values  sales increased approximately 
sales of aerospace controls  excluding the foreign exchange impact  increased approximately million in particularly on the strength of military aircraft controls in the united kingdom and  to a lesser extent  missile controls in italy 
sales of industrial controls increased approximately million in  excluding the foreign exchange impact  primarily due to improved sales in the company s industrial electrics product line 
sales of industrial hydraulics controls marginally declined in europe and were offset by sales gains in japan 
operating profit for the international controls segment decreased to million  or of segment sales  compared to million  or of segment sales  in  primarily related to industrial controls 
margins in europe were affected by the movement of certain currencies in countries where the company s products are manufactured relative to currencies in countries where the products are sold 
margins in the industrial electrics product line were affected by approximately million of costs incurred throughout the year to better position plastic systems controls for the long term 
the remainder of the decline was attributable to a shift in industrial controls product lines to lower margin electric controls  along with a shift within the industrial hydraulics product line away from higher margin mechanical feedback valves 
backlog at september  for the international controls segment was million compared to million at september  the increase was attributable to growth in orders for electric drives for military ground vehicles in germany and industrial hydraulics in japan  partially offset by approximately million attributable to weaker currencies 
compared with consolidated net sales for were million versus million in the increase was due to an increase of million in sales of controls for aerospace applications and an increase of million in industrial controls 
the increased aerospace controls sales were attributable to increased volume in controls for commercial and military aircraft and satellites and launch vehicles  while industrial controls increased as a result of improved sales of industrial hydraulics controls throughout europe 
cost of sales for was of net sales compared to of net sales in approximately half of the decrease as a percentage of sales was due to transition costs incurred in related to the acquisition of certain actuation product lines of alliedsignal inc in june and the remainder was due to increased sales in the higher margin industrial hydraulics and satellites and launch vehicles product lines 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in due to the development of advanced actuation technology and active vibration development efforts in the us related to commercial and military aircraft controls 
selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in approximately half of the increase as a percentage of sales resulted from compensation costs associated with stock appreciation rights  with the remainder due to temporarily high legal expenses and amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest expense was million for  compared with million for a recapitalization initiated by the company in may enhanced the company s long term capital base and provided additional senior debt capacity to fund growth  while increasing the company s average interest rate 
although the recapitalization resulted in higher interest expense for the third and fourth quarters of  interest expense declined to of sales in from in the effective tax rate for was 
the effective tax rate was affected by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards at the german subsidiary 
in  the company continued to reduce its valuation allowance for deferred tax assets principally related to the improving financial position of its german subsidiary 
results in include a 
million extraordinary loss  net of income tax benefit  on the early repayment of debt 
as a result of the factors mentioned above  net earnings for increased to million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in domestic controls domestic controls net sales in were million  up above net sales of million in sales of aerospace controls accounted for most of the increase 
operating profit for the domestic controls segment was million for  or of segment sales 
this compares to million  or of segment sales  in aerospace controls accounted for substantially all of the increase as a result of increased sales  along with the absence in of transition costs associated with the acquisition of certain actuation product lines from alliedsignal inc in international controls international controls net sales in were million versus million in international controls net sales growth relates principally to increased volumes due to stronger demand for industrial hydraulics throughout europe and  to a lesser degree  the december acquisition of the industrial servovalve product line of ultra hydraulics limited 
the movement of certain foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in versus did not have a significant impact on sales 
international controls operating profit was million for  or of segment sales  compared to million  or of segment sales in the increase is a result of higher segment sales due to improved european capital goods market conditions 
financial condition and liquidity cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and the increase in resulted from lower working capital requirements  and to a lesser extent  improved earnings as adjusted for non cash expenses and charges 
long term senior debt increased by million to million at september  from september  primarily due to the acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business  which was principally financed with proceeds from the bank credit facility  offset by cash provided by operations 
the percentage of long term debt to capitalization at september  was compared to at september  at september   the company had million of unused borrowing capacity available under short and long term lines of credit  including million from the bank credit facility 
during  the company obtained a million credit facility for its international subsidiaries 
approximately million was available on this facility at september  working capital at september  was million compared to million at september  the current ratio was at september   compared to at september  current assets increased by million to million at september  the increase was due to the acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business which added approximately million of current assets  primarily receivables and inventories 
in addition  receivables and inventories increased in the international controls segment as a result of increased business 
these increases were partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations which resulted in a decrease in current assets of approximately million 
current liabilities increased by million to million at september  the increase was due to greater working capital demands related to higher sales and approximately million from the acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business 
these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency translation values resulting in a reduction in current liabilities of approximately million 
net property  plant and equipment increased 
million to million at september  capital expenditures for were million compared with depreciation and amortization of million 
capital expenditures in were million compared with depreciation and amortization of million 
the acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business added approximately million of property  plant and equipment  while unfavorable movements in foreign currency translation values resulted in a decrease of approximately million 
during  the company entered into operating leases for equipment which otherwise would have had a purchase cost of million 
capital expenditures for are expected to be below depreciation and amortization levels 
capital expenditures in are expected to include the cost of approximately  square feet of facilities expansion for the domestic aerospace controls operations and a low cost manufacturing operation in the philippines 
goodwill increased by million to million at september   primarily as a result of the october acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business  offset by current year amortization of million 
the goodwill resulting from this acquisition is being amortized over years

the standard must be adopted by fiscal the company is currently evaluating the disclosures required under this new standard 
other foreign exchange instruments are used to hedge the company s equity in  and long term advances to  various international subsidiaries 
in addition  the company periodically utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge known foreign currency cash flows 
interest rate swaps are used to manage exposure to increases in interest rates on a floating rate credit facility 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at september   the company believes that adequate reserves have been established for all currently pending environmental issues  and does not expect environmental matters and the utilization of existing reserves  if any  to have a material effect on the financial condition and liquidity or results of operations of the company 
sales to boeing represented approximately of the company s net sales  and approximately of the company s sales were to boeing for commercial aircraft only 
boeing recently announced plans  and the related costs  to rectify difficulties it is experiencing with commercial aircraft production inefficiencies and resulting late deliveries of its series airplanes 
boeing s announced plans to rectify these matters include  among other things  the temporary shutdown of certain lines of production to allow it to concentrate on catching up on deliveries of certain of its series aircraft 
as moog is current on all of its scheduled deliveries to boeing  the company does not foresee that any temporary shutdown will have any materially adverse impact on its results of operations at this time or in the near future 
however  there can be no assurance that  at some future date  boeing will not modify its existing orders with the company in order to allow other vendors to catch up on deliveries 
recent months have seen an unusually rapid devaluation of certain asian pacific currencies including those in countries where the company has operations 
similarly  certain financial markets have experienced valuation adjustments 
the company s sales in the asian pacific  excluding japan  were million in  or of consolidated sales 
including japan  sales were million or of sales 
at this time  the company is unaware of any major shifts in incoming orders that would produce materially adverse effects on the company s results of operations in the near term 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the computer systems and software products situation commonly referred to as the year issue 
the year issue  which affects most corporations  concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer software programs  to properly recognize and process date sensitive information relating to the year and beyond 
the company utilizes a significant number of computer software programs and operating systems across its entire organization  including applications used in manufacturing  product development  financial business systems and various administrative functions 
to the extent the company s software applications contain source code that is unable to appropriately interpret the upcoming calendar year  some level of modification  or even possibly replacement of such applications may be necessary 
the company is currently in the process of completing the identification of applications that may require modification or replacement 
the company does not currently anticipate that it will incur material expenditures to complete any such modification or replacement as the company believes that a majority of its systems are year compliant  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
the company s issues relate not only to its own systems being year compliant  but also those systems of its suppliers and customers 
a failure of suppliers or customers to address the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company 
outlook the company believes its aerospace controls product lines are well positioned 
the commercial airplane market upswing  the demand for satellites and launch vehicles  and military aircraft modernization programs are expected to provide revenue growth 
the industrial hydraulics product line was significantly enhanced with the acquisition of the us industrial hydraulics business in october further synergies are expected in as the integration with the european and the asian pacific subsidiaries continues 
sales growth in industrial electrics is anticipated principally due to military ground vehicle controls and entertainment simulators
