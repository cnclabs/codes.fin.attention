one of the study recommendations was to consolidate its seven regional processing operations into one center and standardize its processes and procedures 
the corporation acquired and fully renovated an  square foot building in to house the operational functions 
deposit processing functions were transferred to the new center in the fourth quarter 
loan and other processes will be consolidated at the center in  and the corporation will be converting to new technology  in many of its major systems  with its long term technology partner  eds corporation 
in the last half of  the corporation will begin consolidating and converting the banks it acquired over the past months into these new systems 
the corporation has already invested million in new facilities and equipment of the expected million investment in this project 
the expenses related to the project are expected to temper earnings growth to the percent range  however  the corporation anticipates achieving or exceeding its year published financial goals 
the corporation believes that this project will enable it to continue to be competitive in the market place 
while it believes that it has always been an efficient company  the new processes  when fully implemented  should increase its efficiency and eliminate expenses related to operating separate processing functions in each of its banking regions

it requires that when a definitive plan exists to sell the loan and retain servicing rights  the cost of the mortgage will be allocated between the loan and the related mortgage servicing right based on their relative fair values at the date of origination or purchase  otherwise  the date of sale will be used 
sfas no 
also requires assessing the capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment based on the fair value of those rights 
the impact in was an additional million of income 
mortgage banking income was also positively impacted by a larger servicing portfolio  as serviced loans grew to billion at year end from billion at year end this created an additional million in servicing revenue in the remainder of the increase in mortgage banking income is attributable to residential loan originations as origination fees  underwriting fees and escrow waiver fees increased approximately million

management regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses to ensure that the allowance is sufficient to absorb potential losses arising from the credit granting process 
factors considered include the levels of non performing loans  other real estate  past due trends  growth in the loan portfolio  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  historical net charge offs  the present and potential financial condition of borrowers  general economic conditions  specific industry conditions and other regulatory or legal issues that could affect the corporation s loss potential 
the corporation believes that the allowance for possible loan losses as of december   is adequate to absorb potential loan losses as evidenced by its charge off experience and allowance coverage of non performing loans discussed below

this philosophy is embodied through the monitoring and reviewing of credit policies and procedures to ensure that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
non performing loans are considered a leading indicator of future loan losses 
non performing loans are defined as non accrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
loans are normally placed on non accrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact on the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on non accrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in non performing loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and in the process of collection 
also included in non performing loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

at december   potential problem loans totaled million 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry  but rather cover a diverse range of businesses  eg communications  wholesale trade  manufacturing  finance insurance real estate  and services

banking subsidiaries meet their cash flow requirements by having funds available to satisfy customer credit needs as well as having available funds to satisfy deposit withdrawal requests 
liquidity at banking subsidiaries is derived from deposit growth  money market investments  maturing loans  the maturity of investment securities held to maturity  the maturity or sale of investment securities available for sale  access to other funding sources and markets  and a strong capital position 
deposit growth is the primary source of liquidity at the banking subsidiaries 
total period end deposits increased million from to the corporation s overall deposit base grew an average of million or during deposit growth  especially in the core deposit base  is the most stable source of liquidity of a bank 
another substantial source of liquidity is the corporation s maturing investment securities portfolio  particularly securities maturing within one year 
at december   the amortized cost of securities  both securities held to maturity and securities available for sale  maturing within one year amounted to million or of the total securities portfolio 
at the end of  the securities portfolio contained million at amortized cost of us treasury and federal agency securities available for sale  representing of the total securities portfolio at amortized cost 
these government securities are highly marketable and had a market value of million or of amortized cost at year end 
money market investments  consisting of federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  averaged million in compared to million in the funds provided from the maturity of these assets were used as a funding source for the growth in loans and securities  which generally have higher yields 
being short term and liquid by nature  money market assets generally provide a lower yield than other earning assets 
the corporation has a strategy of maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity to accommodate fluctuations in funding sources and will periodically take advantage of specific opportunities to temporarily invest excess funds at narrower than normal rate spreads while still generating additional net interest income 
at december   the corporation had million outstanding in short term money market investments  serving as an essential source of liquidity 
the year end amount represents of total assets compared to at december  the loan portfolio is also a source of additional liquidity 
the corporation has million of commercial loans and real estate construction loans maturing within one year and a steady flow of repayments in the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
additionally  the corporation has billion of loans secured by one to four family residential property that could possibly be securitized 
within the classification of short term borrowings at year end  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million compared with million at the end of federal funds are purchased from a sizeable network of correspondent banks while securities sold under agreements to repurchase are obtained from a base of individual  business and public entity customers 
the aggregate subsidiary liquidity resources were sufficient in to fund the growth in loans and the investment securities portfolio  and to meet other needs for cash when necessary 
as of december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures  ie to purchase fixed assets 
however  the corporation is making investments in equipment and facilities to support its technology upgrades 
deposit growth will continue to be the primary source of bank subsidiary liquidity on a long term basis  along with stable earnings  the resulting cash generated by operating activities and strong capital positions 
shorter term liquidity needs will mainly be derived from growth in short term borrowings  maturing money market and investment portfolio securities  loan maturities and access to other funding sources 
liquidity is also necessary at the parent company level 
the parent company s primary sources of funds are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  borrowings and proceeds from issuance of equity 
the parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to shareholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries and satisfy other operating requirements 
dividends received from subsidiaries totaled million in and will continue to be the parent s main source of long term liquidity 
the dividends from subsidiaries  along with a million increase in net short term borrowed funds  were sufficient to pay cash dividends to the corporation s common shareholders of million in  and fund increased lending activities of nonbanking subsidiaries of million 
at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by subsidiary banks without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
additionally  the parent company had million of established lines of credit with nonaffiliated banks  of which million was in use 
of the amount in use  the parent company downstreamed the majority to the corporation s residential and commercial mortgage banking subsidiaries and leasing company for their use in funding loans and leases 
the parent company also has access to funds from the issuance of the corporation s commercial paper  although such funds are also downstreamed to the non bank subsidiaries 
commercial paper outstanding at december   totaled million 
the corporation s long term debt to equity ratio at december   was compared to at december  the decrease is attributable to the change in current maturities of long term borrowings between years

there are no known trends nor any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result or are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in the corporation s liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk is the exposure to a bank s earnings and capital arising from changes in future interest rates 
all banks assume interest rate risk as an integral part of normal banking operations 
the management of interest rate risk includes four components policy statements  risk limits  risk measurement and reporting procedures 
an important responsibility of the asset liability committee alco of each subsidiary bank is the management of risks associated with changing interest rates  changing asset and liability mixes  and their impact on earnings 
these alcos  in turn  operate under the advisory policy guidelines on interest rate sensitivity set by the corporation s alco 
the sensitivity of net interest income to market rate changes is evaluated regularly by the corporation to determine the effectiveness of interest rate risk management 
interest rate sensitivity analysis can be performed in several different ways 
the traditional method of measuring interest sensitivity is called gap analysis 
gap analysis is used to identify mismatches in the repricing of assets and liabilities within specified periods of time or interest sensitivity gaps 
for all assets and liabilities repriced within one year  the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities was at december  as presented  this traditional gap analysis does not accurately reflect the corporation s true rate sensitivity position 
the categories of savings  now  and money market accounts have been included in the days category for this gap analysis 
while these accounts are contractually short term in nature  it is management s experience that repricing occurs over a longer period of time 
the year end liability sensitive position would tend to provide favorable short term effects on earnings during periods of declining rates while rising rates would tend to affect net interest income unfavorably over the short run 
the corporation uses simulation modeling results that incorporate the dynamics of balance sheet and interest rate changes and reflect the related impact on net interest income over a specified time horizon 
the corporation is continually reviewing its interest rate risk position and modifying its strategies based upon simulation projections under various interest rate levels 
additionally  the corporation may enter into interest rate swap agreements to assist in managing interest rate risk 
management s philosophy is to maintain an appropriate rate sensitive asset and liability position to provide for stability in earnings in the event of significant interest rate changes 
the corporation believes that it has an effective process for managing interest rate risk

the adequacy of the corporation s capital is regularly reviewed to ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines 
the assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  stability of earnings  changing competitive forces  economic condition in markets served and strength of management 
as of december  and  the corporation s tier risk based capital ratios  total risk based capital tier and tier ratios and tier leverage ratios were well in excess of regulatory requirements 
management of the corporation expects to continue to exceed the minimum standards in the future 
capital ratios are included in note  regulatory matters  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the corporation s board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to  shares of the corporation s common stock in the market from time to time 
the shares repurchased would be available in connection with the corporation s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes 
shares repurchased are held as treasury stock and  accordingly  are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders equity 
the corporation purchased  of its common shares in and  in management believes that a strong capital position is necessary to take advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion  and to provide depositor and investor confidence 
the corporation s capital level remains strong  but must also be maintained at an appropriate level that provides the opportunity for a superior return on the capital employed 
management actively reviews capital strategies for the corporation and each of its subsidiaries to ensure that capital levels are appropriate based on the perceived business risks  future growth opportunities  industry standards  and regulatory requirements

until january  this statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
it distinguishes transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
management of the corporation does not expect that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the corporation s financial position  results of operations  or liquidity
