casual product line sales increased by 
the company believes that due to its high quality and innovative designs  existing retail customers have allocated more floor space  requiring larger inventories of the company s casual aluminum furniture 
the contract seating product line experienced a sales increase of since construction in the lodging industry increased demand 
rta product line sales decreased by due to the company s restructuring of this product line in september  this restructuring resulted in the company exiting the promotionally priced seating market  beginning a transition from traditional lower margin rta products to higher margin products 
also in  some mass merchants purchased fewer products as a result of price increases in the rta product line 
in late  winsloew began rebuilding its specialty store futon business 
however  sales of futon products to the specialty store market have declined from the levels of these decreases were offset by continental engineering group  inc  which was included for all of gross margin consolidated gross margin increased to in  compared to excluding provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million for rta and  for contract seating in each of winsloew s product lines experienced increases in gross margin 
the casual and contract seating product lines had improved gross margins in  due to greater operating efficiencies from increased sales volumes 
the casual product line also experienced favorable raw material costs in the rta product line gross margin improved by percentage points 
this increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of continental engineering group  inc  whose products have higher gross margins than the company s traditional rta products and the company s sale of its promotionally priced seating business which eliminated sales of these lower margin products 
as noted above  winsloew has reduced lower margin product offerings and certain mass merchant market sales 
the company has also reduced manufacturing overhead  labor and material costs in the rta product line 
these factors have allowed winsloew to improve margins at a lower level of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased in due to the addition of continental for all of  increased commissions as a result of increased sales volume in the casual and contract seating product lines  increased sales promotional expenses and increased provisions for uncollectable accounts receivable 
operating income as a result of the above  winsloew recorded operating income of million of net sales in compared to operating income of  of net sales in interest expense winsloew s interest expense decreased  in  compared to the company had reduced its debt by million up until december   when it purchased million of its common stock 
this stock purchase resulted in a net debt reduction in of million 
these reductions in debt levels and the company s increased profitability have led to improved financial ratios and  in turn  allowed the company to pay lower spreads between the base rate and libor and the rates which the company is obligated to pay to its lenders 
these lower spreads decreased the company s effective interest rate below those incurred in provision for income taxes winsloew s effective tax rate of is greater than the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state income taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization 
the company recorded an income tax provision of  in while incurring a net loss for the period 
this anomaly in is due primarily to the non deductibility of goodwill amortization and the write off of goodwill which was included in the million charge recorded for exiting the rta seating product market as described below 
charges for restructuring as discussed below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for  winsloew recorded a charge in of million related to a plan to redirect the marketing and operations of the company s rta product line 
the restructuring plan was substantially completed during however  as part of the restructuring  the company had excess capacity at its rta manufacturing facilities 
the company disclosed plans to consolidate these production facilities into fewer locations and sell any excess facilities 
as a result  winsloew recorded a charge of  to reduce excess facilities to their estimated realizable value 
in the first quarter of  management completed its review of its facilities  culminating in a decision to consolidate its tennessee operations from four facilities to two facilities 
this consolidation has resulted in no material change to the charge recorded in winsloew s management is exploring ways to minimize the cost of this consolidation effort so as to have an insignificant effect on cash flows 
as a result  while originally scheduled to be completed during the third quarter of  the consolidation effort has extended into the first quarter of comparison of years ended december  and charges for restructuring and other special charges as described above  the company is the product of a merger of two companies which operated before the merger in a variety of furniture markets  businesses and product line offerings 
following the merger  management undertook a review of the marketing and operations strategy of certain of the company s businesses  including a review of recorded asset balances  particularly inventories  for possible reduction in carrying values 
as a result of this review  the board of directors adopted a plan to redirect the marketing and operations of certain of the company s businesses 
the plan included exiting certain markets and product lines 
as a result of the changes to be implemented  the company recorded a charge of million for restructuring 
this charge is the result of management s plan to make changes in the product lines  management  marketing focus  and operational strategy in the company s rta product line 
the table below summarizes the charges for restructuring recorded in reduction in carrying value of promotionally priced seating subsidiary held for sale  reduction in carrying values of manufacturing facilities held for sale and other asset write downs  reduction in inventory values from exiting certain futon product lines  severance costs for certain former management  total  management s review also identified other operating and financial issues related to ongoing operations of the company  which were not recorded as part of the charges for restructuring 
the review resulted in additional operating charges totaling million of net sales 
these additional charges include million for inventory which was considered excess  unusable or obsolete and  for accounts receivable which were considered uncollectable 
management reviewed the marketing strategy and operating philosophies of the rta division and proposed several changes  noted below  that were approved as part of the plan 
the plan generally is to move the company to higher margin products and away from lower margin products 
in march   the company acquired continental engineering group  inc continental  a manufacturer of ergonomically designed space savers 
continental s products are designed and priced in the upper end price points of the rta furniture market  and provide a higher gross margin and growth rates than current rta product offerings of the company 
continental s success led management to explore the development of higher margin product lines within its traditional rta businesses 
prior to the purchase of continental  this division had served the low end price points of the rta market by distributing through mass merchant retailers 
during  the division s margins declined due to a switch in product mix from predominately spindle products to a more balanced mix of spindle and flatline products 
as part of the plan  the division expects to increase its gross margins through new product introductions in both spindle and flatline products  and at the same time  discontinue its traditional lower margin products 
another part of the plan was to re focus the company s marketing of its futon products 
during  sales of futon products grew rapidly as a result of the introduction of low end products offered to mass merchants 
in an effort to serve those customers  service and quality suffered in the core specialty store business 
in  the company discontinued serving the low end mass merchant business and re focused efforts on rebuilding the specialty store business 
the company reduced the number of futon products offered to this niche in order to improve manufacturing efficiencies  focus on its best selling products and to reduce overall inventory levels 
as a result  management determined that there were excess inventory levels related to the old product lines from which the company was exiting 
the company reviewed the inventory for these product lines and  during the third quarter  recorded a charge of  to reduce the carrying value of related inventory 
during the fourth quarter  management continued its review of the futon product line and identified additional inventory to be included in the discontinued product lines which increased this charge to a total of  for the year 
as an additional part of the restructuring of the rta business  the board of directors approved a plan to exit the market for promotionally priced seating products for office furniture wholesalers through the sale of a subsidiary which manufactured and distributed this product line 
these products  which were generally at the lower price points in this market  produced low profit margins  which no longer fit the strategy for the rta division 
during the third quarter  the company recorded a  charge to reduce the carrying value of this subsidiary to an estimated net asset value of  during the fourth quarter  the company sold the subsidiary and reduced the recorded loss by  to a loss of  the sales and operating income of this subsidiary were not significant to the operations of the company 
as final result of its restructuring plan  the company had excess manufacturing capacity 
as part of its effort to reduce overhead costs and to improve manufacturing efficiencies  the company has consolidated its rta production facilities into fewer locations and is selling its excess facilities 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of  to reduce these facilities to their estimated realizable value 
the sale of these facilities would lower operating expenses by  also  included in the charge for restructuring is  for the write off of other assets related to the mass merchant product line and  for severance costs for terminated division management 
net sales the company s consolidated net sales increased million  or to million in from million in net sales increased in all product lines except for rta 
net sales increased in the casual furniture product line primarily due to sales from texacraft  inc  purchased in september   being included for a full year  and the addition of new customers 
net sales in contract seating grew due to increased sales to the company s core business customers 
net sales in rta decreased due primarily to the company s decision in the first quarter of to begin discontinuing futon sales to mass merchants and the overall weakness in the futon market 
this decrease was offset by the addition of continental engineering group  inc in march   and the introduction and expansion of the company s flatline products 
gross profit the consolidated gross margin decreased to in  compared to in the consolidated margin was unfavorably impacted by the rta product line 
the contract seating and rta gross margins declined due primarily to increased reserves totaling million for excess  unusable and obsolete inventory 
gross margins also declined in rta due to raw material price increases that could not be immediately passed on to customers since winsloew was committed to sell at a fixed price during the customer s catalog season 
rta gross margin also decreased due to under absorption of fixed overhead expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in compared to the increase was due to additional expenses from the acquisitions of texacraft and continental  marketing expenses associated with increased sales volume in the contract seating division and increased provisions for uncollectable accounts receivable of  in these increases were offset by reductions in the rta division 
operating income as a result of the above  the company s operating income was  of net sales including the charges for restructuring of million and the other adjustments identified by management during the third quarter of totaling million in  compared to operating income of million of net sales in interest expense  net the company s net interest expense increased by million in due to increased average debt balances as a result of borrowing million for the continental acquisition and million to repurchase common stock  offset by lower interest rates in income tax expense the company recorded an income tax provision of  in while incurring a net loss for the period 
this anomaly is due primarily to the non deductibility of goodwill amortization and the write off of goodwill which is included in the million charge recorded for exiting the rta seating product market described above 
the company s effective tax rate of for was more than the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state income taxes and the non deductibility of goodwill amortization 
extraordinary item the company incurred an extraordinary charge of  net of an income tax benefit of  related to prepayment penalties and the write off of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the retirement of the separate credit facilities in the first quarter of seasonality and quarterly information the furniture industry is cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions  consumer confidence  and discretionary income  interest rate levels and credit availability 
sales of casual products are typically higher in the second quarter and fourth quarters of each year  primarily as a result of high retail demand for casual furniture in the second quarter  preceding the summer months  and the impact of special sales programs on fourth quarter sales 
the company s casual product sales can also be affected by weather conditions during the peak retail selling season and the resulting impact on consumer purchases of outdoor furniture products 
the following table presents the company s unaudited quarterly data for and such operating results are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods 
winsloew believes that all necessary and normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts in order to present fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with winsloew s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein

the company has historically financed its short term liquidity needs with internally generated funds and revolving line of credit borrowings 
at december   the company had million of working capital and million of unused and available funds under its credit facilities 
the company has a senior credit facility with a consortium of banks and other institutional lenders 
the facility  which matures in february and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company  consists of a revolving line of credit  term loan and an acquisition line of credit 
the working capital revolving line of credit allows the company to borrow funds up to a certain percentage of eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
the million acquisition line of credit can be used for capital expenditures and purchases of the company s common stock 
in june  winsloew amended its senior credit facility to provide the company with a variable amount available under the revolving line of credit as limited by its available accounts receivable and inventory 
due to the seasonal nature of the casual furniture product line  winsloew s cash requirements are usually greater in the first quarter of each year 
the june amendment allows the amount available to fluctuate with the seasonal nature of the company s business 
after the first quarter of each year  the company s cash requirements from its credit line are less 
by use of a variable amount of credit availability  the company can avoid the cost of an available but unused line of credit 
at december   from an available maximum line of credit of million  winsloew has elected to set the amount available at million 
in july  winsloew amended its senior credit facility to allow the company to borrow up to million under its line of credit to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
as of december   winsloew has million of this amount remaining to purchase shares of its common stock 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s credit facility 
cash flows from operating activities for  cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million provided in the primary reasons for the increase in cash provided by operating activities were the company s program to reduce accounts receivable levels  increased collections due to improved gross margins and increases in accounts payable 
cash flows from investing activities the company s net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million the company paid million in cash  including capitalized acquisition costs  to purchase continental engineering in winsloew also reduced its capital expenditures by  from levels 
at december   the company has no material commitment for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compare to million in this increase was due to cash used to repurchase million of the company s common stock in foreign exchange fluctuations and effects of inflation winsloew purchases some raw materials from several italian suppliers 
these purchases expose the company to the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar versus the italian lira 
if the us dollar declines in value versus the italian lira  the company will pay more in us dollars for these purchases 
to reduce its exposure to loss from such potential foreign exchange fluctuations  the company will occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts 
these contracts allow the company to buy italian lira at a predetermined exchange rate  thereby transferring the risk of subsequent exchange rate fluctuations to a third party 
however  if the company is unable to continue such forward contract activities  and the company s inventories increase in connection with expanding sales activities  a weakening of the us dollar against the italian lira could result in reduced gross margins 
in  the company purchased million of these materials 
the company elected to hedge a portion of its exposure to purchases made in by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with a value of  none of which is outstanding and unsettled at december  the company did not incur significant gains or losses from these foreign currency transactions 
inflation has not had a significant impact on the company in the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future
