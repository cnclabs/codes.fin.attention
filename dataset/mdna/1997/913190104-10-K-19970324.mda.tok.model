an analysis of income taxes is included in note to the financial statements 
effects of inflation operating income from utility operations is normally not materially affected by inflation because cost increases generally lead to proportionate increases in revenues allowed through the regulatory process 
however  there is a lag in the recovery of higher expenses through the regulatory process  and therefore  high inflation could have a detrimental effect on the company until rate increases are received 
conversely  lower inflation and lower interest rates tend to result in reductions in the rates of return allowed by the utility commissions  as has occurred over the last several years
