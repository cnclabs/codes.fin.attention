sega  and multimedia pcs 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change  resulting in entertainment platform and related software product cycles 
no single entertainment platform or system has achieved long term dominance in the interactive entertainment market 
the home interactive entertainment industry started a new period of growth in when nintendo introduced the nes  a read only memory rom cartridge based bit system 
in  sega introduced the bit cartridge based genesis and  in  nintendo introduced the bit cartridge based snes 
the bit systems were more sophisticated than the bit systems  producing faster and more complex images with more life like animation and better sound effects

retailers typically prefer to deal with companies that have track records of producing successful titles and a broad product line 
additionally  software titles  especially those for the entertainment platforms market  require significant marketing support to generate high sales volume 
the introduction of faster microprocessors  graphics accelerator chips  enhanced operating systems  and increases in memory and processing power have facilitated the development of software for the multimedia pc market 
the increase in the installed base of multimedia pcs has resulted in an increased demand for software capable of being used on such systems

although older titles may continue to be available for sale  the company generally actively markets only its ten to fifteen most recently released titles 
the life cycle of a title generally ranges from less than three months to upwards of twelve months for the company s key titles 
the life cycle of a particular title is dependent on its initial success 
although actual results vary greatly from title to title  the retail sell through of a title is generally highest during the to days immediately after its introduction

the company s ability to meet its financial covenants and its payment obligations can be affected by factors beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain waivers of any future default or that the lenders will not exercise their remedies 
in such event  the company s operations would be materially adversely affected 
substantial leverage and ability to service debt the company s ability to satisfy its obligations to its lenders will be dependent upon its future performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the company s control 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the level of the company s indebtedness could have important consequences to investors in the company  because i a portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service  including the notes and the company s existing bank obligations  and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital  or to pursue possible expansion of its business or acquisitions  may be limited  and iii the company s level of indebtedness could limit its flexibility in reacting to changes in the interactive entertainment industry and economic conditions generally  making it more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and limiting its ability to withstand competitive pressures or take advantage of business opportunities 
certain of the company s competitors currently operate on a less leveraged basis  and are likely to have significantly greater operating and financing flexibility than the company 
the company believes that  based upon current levels of operations  it should be able to meet its interest obligations on the notes  and its interest and principal obligations under its bank agreements  when due 
however  if the company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its debt obligations when due  the company might be required to restructure or refinance its indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that any such restructuring or refinancing will be effected on satisfactory terms or will be permitted by the terms of the indenture  or the company s existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that the company s operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its debt service requirements or to repay the notes at maturity or that the company will be able to refinance the notes or other indebtedness at maturity 
see prior rights of creditors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
prior rights of creditors the company has outstanding long term debt including current portions of million at august  the company s failure to make payments of interest or principal on such indebtedness when due may result in defaults under its agreements with respect to such indebtedness and under the indenture 
certain of such indebtedness is secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the indenture provides that  upon the occurrence of certain events each a repurchase event  the company may be obligated to repurchase all or a portion of the outstanding notes 
if a repurchase event were to occur and the company did not have  or could not obtain  sufficient financial resources to repurchase the notes  such failure to repurchase the notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
the occurrence of certain repurchase events would also constitute a default under certain of the company s current loan agreements  including the company s main credit facility with bny  and may constitute an event of default under the terms of future agreements with respect to the company s borrowings 
the default under the indenture for the company s failure to effect a repurchase of the notes would also constitute an event of default under certain of the company s existing loan agreements 
further  the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations are  in part  dependent upon its receipt of dividends and other advances and transfers of funds from its subsidiaries 
the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay such dividends and make such advances will be subject to applicable state and foreign law regulating the payment of dividends and the terms of the company s existing bank agreements and the indenture 
a significant portion of the company s assets  operations  trade payables and other indebtedness are located at subsidiaries of the company and the creditors of such subsidiaries would generally recover from the assets of such subsidiaries on the obligations owed to them by such subsidiaries prior to any recovery by creditors of the company and prior to any distribution of remaining assets to equity holders of the company 
an event of default with respect to the company s current bank agreements may result in acceleration of the company s obligations under such bank agreements or demand by the lenders for immediate repayment and would entitle any secured creditor in respect of such debt to proceed against the collateral securing such defaulted loan 
an event of default under the indenture may result in actions by ibj schroder bank trust company  as trustee the trustee  on behalf of the holders of the notes 
in the event of such acceleration by the company s creditors or action by the trustee  holders of indebtedness would be entitled to payment out of the assets of the company 
if the company becomes insolvent  is liquidated or reorganized  it is possible that there will not be sufficient assets remaining after payment to such creditors for any distribution to holders of common stock

nasdaq delisting and liquidity of common stock in order to maintain the listing of the common stock on the nasdaq national market system the nms  at may   the company was required  among other things  to maintain net tangible assets of at least million 
at may   the company did not meet this requirement 
based on its review of certain information provided by the company  nasdaq informed the company that it has determined that the common stock remain listed on the nms pending nasdaq s review of the company s status upon filing of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended august  subsequent to may   the nasdaq stock market adopted new maintenance criteria for securities listed on the nms 
under such criteria  the company is required  among other things  to maintain a minimum bid price of per share of common stock 
the company does not currently meet the minimum bid price criteria although the company s performance as of august  does meet the other quantitative maintenance criteria 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the common stock will not be delisted from trading on the nms 
if the common stock were to be delisted from trading on the nms  in order to obtain relisting of the common stock on the nms  the company must satisfy quantitative designation criteria  including a minimum net tangible assets requirement which it does not currently meet 
no assurance can be given that the company will meet such relisting criteria in the near future 
if the common stock were to be delisted from trading on the nms  the company may seek to have the common stock listed for trading on the nasdaq small cap market 
although the company meets the current listing criteria for the nasdaq small cap market other than a minimum bid price of per share of common stock  no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to obtain listing for the common stock on the nasdaq small cap market or as to the company s ability to meet the maintenance requirements thereof 
if the common stock were to be delisted from trading on the nms and were neither relisted thereon nor listed for trading on the nasdaq small cap market  trading  if any  in the common stock may continue to be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in the non nasdaq over the counter market 
delisting of the common stock would result in limited release of the market price of the common stock and limited news coverage of the company and could restrict investors interest in the common stock and materially adversely affect the trading market and prices for the common stock and the company s ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing 
in addition  if the common stock were not listed and the trading price of the common stock were less than per share  the common stock could be subject to rule g under the securities exchange act of which  among other things  requires that broker dealers satisfy special sales practice requirements  including making individualized written suitability determinations and receiving a purchaser s written consent prior to any transaction 
in such case  the common stock could also be deemed to be a penny stock under the securities enforcement and penny stock reform act of  which would require additional disclosure in connection with trades in the common stock  including the delivery of a disclosure schedule explaining the nature and risks of the penny stock market 
such requirements could severely limit the liquidity of the common stock 
litigation in conjunction with certain claims and litigations for which the settlement obligation is currently probable and estimable see business recent developments and legal proceedings  the company recorded a charge of million in the year ended august  no assurance can be given that the company will not be required to record additional material charges in future periods in conjunction with the various litigations to which the company is a party 
any additional charges to earnings arising from an adverse result in such litigations or an inadequacy in the charge recorded in fiscal could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
a portion of any settlement or judgment in one or more of the litigations to which the company is a party may be covered by the company s insurance

industry trends  platform transition  technological change the interactive entertainment industry is characterized by  and the company anticipates that it will continue to undergo  rapid technological change due in large part to i the introduction of entertainment platforms incorporating more advanced processors and operating systems  ii the impact of technological changes embodied in multimedia pcs and software therefor  iii the development of electronic and wireless delivery systems and iv the entry and participation of new companies in the industry 
these factors have resulted in hardware platform and software life cycles 
no single hardware platform or system has achieved long term dominance 
accordingly  the company must continually anticipate and adapt its software titles to emerging hardware platforms and systems and evolving consumer preferences 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing software for new hardware platforms 
the process of developing software titles such as those offered by the company is extremely complex and is expected to become more complex and expensive in the future as consumers demand more sophisticated and elaborate features and as new platforms and technologies are introduced 
development of software for emerging hardware platforms requires substantial investments in research and development for new and improved technologies in the areas of graphics  sound  digitized speech  music and video 
such research and development must occur well in advance of the release of new hardware platforms in order to allow sufficient lead time to develop and introduce new software titles on a timely basis 
this generally requires the company to predict the probable success of hardware platforms as much as to months prior to the release of compatible software 
substantially all of the company s revenues in fiscal were derived from the sale of titles designed to be played on the n  playstation  sega saturn and various multimedia pcs 
at any given time  the company has expended significant development and marketing resources on product development for platforms such as the bit snes and sega genesis platforms that could have shorter life cycles than the company expected  as in fiscal  or on software titles designed for new platforms such as the sony playstation and nintendo n that have not yet achieved large installed bases 
if the company does not accurately predict the success  size of the installed base and life cycle of existing or future hardware platforms due to  among other things  the long software development lead times involved  it could be in the position  as it was in fiscal and  of marketing software for i new hardware platforms that have not yet achieved significant market penetration and or ii hardware platforms that have become or are becoming obsolete due to the introduction or success of new hardware platforms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to predict accurately such matters  and its failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company 
failure to develop software titles for hardware platforms that achieve significant market acceptance  discontinuance of development for a platform that has a longer than expected life cycle  development for a platform that does not achieve a significant installed base or continued development for a platform that has a shorter than expected life cycle  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s results of operations and profitability have been materially adversely affected during the fiscal years ended august  and by the material decline in sales of the company s bit software and the transition to the new hardware platforms described herein 
the company is currently developing software for multimedia pcs  the sony playstation and the nintendo n there are a significant number of software titles for the entertainment platform market competing for limited shelf space 
in addition  the and bit entertainment platforms have not yet achieved market penetration similar to that of the bit entertainment platforms nintendo snes and sega genesis  accordingly  the number of units of each software title sold for these newer entertainment platforms is significantly less than the number of units of a title generally sold during  and for the bit entertainment platforms 
based on publicly available information and its own estimates  the company believes that the installed base of and bit entertainment platforms was approximately million and million units at the end of calendar and at september   respectively  and anticipates that such installed base will be approximately million units by the end of calendar however  no assurance can be given that the installed base of any of the new entertainment platforms will grow substantially or that any of them will achieve market penetration similar to that achieved by the nintendo snes and sega genesis entertainment platforms 
revenue and earnings fluctuations  seasonality the company has historically derived substantially all of its revenues from the publication and distribution of software for then dominant hardware platforms 
the company s revenues are subject to fluctuation during transition periods  as occurred in fiscal and  when new hardware platforms have been introduced but none has achieved mass market penetration 
in addition  the company s earnings are materially affected by the timing of release of new software titles produced by the company 
product development schedules are difficult to predict due  in large part  to the difficulty of scheduling accurately the creative process and  with respect to software for new hardware platforms  the use of new development tools and the learning process associated with development for new technologies 
earnings may also be materially impacted by other factors including  but not limited to  i the level and timing of market acceptance of software titles  ii increases or decreases in development and or promotion expenses for new titles and new versions of existing titles  iii the timing of orders from major customers and iv changes in shipment volume 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter is generally derived from sales of new software titles introduced in that quarter or in the immediately preceding quarter 
if the company were unable to commence volume shipments of a significant new product during the scheduled quarter  the company s revenues and earnings would likely be materially and adversely affected in that quarter 
in addition  because a majority of the unit sales for a product typically occur in the first to days following the introduction of the product  the company s earnings may increase significantly in a period in which a major product introduction occurs and may decline in the following period or in periods in which there are no major product introductions 
certain operating expenses are fixed and do not vary directly in relation to revenue 
consequently  if net revenue is below expectations  the company s operating results are likely to be materially and adversely affected 
the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal 
typically  net revenues are highest during the last calendar quarter which includes the holiday buying season  decline in the first quarter  are lower in the second calendar quarter and increase in the third calendar quarter 
the seasonal pattern is due primarily to the increased demand for software during the year end holiday buying season 
the company s earnings  however  vary significantly and are largely dependent on releases of major new titles and  as such  may not necessarily reflect the seasonal patterns of the industry as a whole 
the company expects that its operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
dependence on entertainment platform manufacturers  need for license renewals in fiscal  and  the company derived  and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of nintendo compatible titles and  and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of sega compatible titles 
in addition  in fiscal and  the company derived and  respectively  of its gross revenues from sales of sony compatible titles 
accordingly  the company is substantially dependent on sony  sega and nintendo as the sole manufacturers of the entertainment platforms marketed by them and as the sole licensors of the proprietary information and technology needed to develop software for those entertainment platforms 
the entertainment platform manufacturers have in the past and may in the future limit the number of titles that the company can release in any year  which may limit any future growth in sales 
the company has historically been able to renew and or negotiate extensions of its software license agreements with entertainment platform developers 
however  there can be no assurance that  at the end of their current terms  the company will continue to be able to do so or that the company will be successful in negotiating definitive license agreements with developers of new hardware platforms 
the company has executed license agreements with sony with respect to the playstation platform in north america  japan  asia and europe and with nintendo with respect to the n platform in north and south america and japan 
the company also develops and markets n software in europe under an oral agreement with nintendo 
currently  the company and sega are operating in the ordinary course under the terms of an agreement that expired in december and  with respect to the saturn platform  under an oral agreement and other arrangements 
the inability to negotiate agreements with developers of new entertainment platforms or the termination of all of the company s license agreements or other arrangements will  and the termination of any one of the company s license agreements or other arrangements could  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
see business platform license agreements and intellectual property licenses 
the company depends on nintendo  sega and sony for the protection of the intellectual property rights to their respective entertainment platforms and technology and their ability to discourage unauthorized persons from producing software for the entertainment platforms developed by each of them 
the company also relies upon the entertainment platform manufacturers for the manufacture of certain cartridge and cd based rom software 
reliance on new titles  product delays the company s ability to maintain favorable relations with retailers and to receive the maximum advantage from its advertising expenditures is dependent in part on its ability to provide retailers with a timely and continuous flow of product 
the life cycle of a software title generally ranges from less than three months to upwards of twelve months  with the majority of sales occurring in the first to days after release 
the company generally actively markets its to most recent releases 
accordingly  the company is constantly required to develop  introduce and sell new software in order to generate revenue and or to replace declining revenues from previously released titles 
in addition  consumer preferences for software are difficult to predict  and few titles achieve sustained market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that new titles introduced by the company will be released in a timely fashion  will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  or that such acceptance will be sustained for any meaningful period 
competition for retail shelf space  consumer preferences and other factors could result in the shortening of the life cycle for older titles and increase the importance of the company s ability to release titles on a timely basis 
the company s current production schedules contemplate that the company will commence shipment of a number of new titles in fiscal shipment dates will vary depending on the company s own quality assurance testing  as well as that by the applicable dedicated platform manufacturer  and other development factors 
the company generally submits new games to the dedicated platform manufacturers and other intellectual property licensors for approval prior to development and or manufacturing 
rejection as a result of bugs in software or a substantial delay in the approval of a product by an entertainment platform manufacturer or licensor could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays in the introduction of certain new titles 
there can be no assurance that such delays will not occur or materially adversely affect the company in the future 
it is likely that in the future certain new titles will not be released in accordance with the company s internal development schedule or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
a significant delay in the introduction of  or the presence of a defect in  one or more new titles could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of such product 
if the company is not able to develop  introduce and sell new competitive titles on a timely basis  its results of operations and profitability would be materially adversely affected 
reliance on hit titles the market for software is hits driven and  accordingly  the company s future success is dependent in large part on its ability to develop and market hit titles for hardware platforms with significant installed bases 
during the fiscal year ended august   sales of the company s top title accounted for approximately of the company s gross sales for that period 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to publish hit titles for hardware platforms with significant installed bases and  if it is unable to do so for any reason  its financial condition  results of operations and profitability could be materially adversely affected  as they were in fiscal and inventory management  risk of product returns the company is generally not contractually obligated to accept returns  except for defective product 
however  the company permits its customers to return or exchange inventory and provides price protection or other concessions for excess or slow moving inventory 
management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
among the more significant of such estimates are allowances for estimated returns  price concessions and other discounts 
at the time of shipment  the company establishes reserves in respect of such estimates taking into account the potential for product returns and other discounts based on historical return rates  seasonality  retail inventories and other factors 
in fiscal  price protection  returns and exchanges were materially higher than the company s reserves therefor  as a result of which the company s results of operations and liquidity in fiscal were materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note n and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  at august   it has established adequate reserves for future price protection  returns  exchanges and other concessions but there can be no assurance that the company s reserves therefor will not be exceeded  which event would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company has offered and anticipates that it will continue to offer stock balancing programs for its multimedia pc software 
the company has established reserves for such programs  which have not been material to date 
no assurance can be given that future stock balancing programs will not become material and or will not exceed the company s reserves for such programs and  if so exceeded  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
increased product development costs in order to manage its software development process and to ensure access to a pool of software developers  development tools and engines in an increasingly competitive market  the company acquired three software studios in calendar the result of such acquisitions was that the company s fixed software development and overhead costs were significantly higher in fiscal and as compared to historical levels 
these costs further contributed to the company s results of operations and profitability being materially adversely affected in fiscal and no assurance can be given that such costs will not continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations in future periods 
see software development 
competition the market for consumer software is highly competitive 
only a small percentage of titles introduced in the software market achieve any degree of sustained market acceptance 
competition is based primarily upon quality of titles  price  access to retail shelf space  product enhancements  ability to operate on popular platforms  availability of titles including hits  new product introductions  marketing support and distribution systems 
the company competes with a variety of companies which offer products that compete directly with one or more of the company s titles 
typically  the company s chief competitor on an entertainment platform is the hardware manufacturer of the platform  to whom the company pays royalties and  in some cases  manufacturing charges 
accordingly  the hardware manufacturers have a price  marketing and distribution advantage with respect to software marketed by them and such advantage is particularly important in a mature or declining market which supports fewer full priced titles and is characterized by customers who make purchasing decisions on titles based primarily on price as compared to developing markets with limited titles  when price has been a less important factor in software sales 
the company s competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than the company  such as nintendo  sega and sony 
the company s competitors also include a number of independent software publishers licensed by the hardware manufacturers 
additionally  the entry and participation of new industries and companies  including diversified entertainment companies  in markets in which the company competes may adversely affect the company s performance in such markets 
the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in the software industry  principally as a result of the technical sophistication of advanced entertainment platform and multimedia pc game products requiring substantial investments in research and development 
in particular  many of the company s competitors are developing on line interactive computer games and interactive networks that will be competitive with the company s software 
as competition increases  significant price competition and reduced profit margins may result 
in addition  competition from new technologies may reduce demand in markets in which the company has traditionally competed 
prolonged price competition or reduced demand as a result of competing technologies would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to compete successfully 
see business competition 
intellectual property licenses and proprietary rights to date  most of the company s software incorporates for marketing purposes properties or trademarks owned by third parties  such as the wwf  the nba  the nfl or their respective players associations  which properties are licensed to the company 
in addition  the company in the past has obtained agreements with independent developers for the development of a significant portion of its software and  in such cases  the company usually acquires copyrights to the underlying software and obtains the exclusive right to such software for a period of time and may have a limited period in which to market and distribute software 
to the extent future product releases are not derived from the company s proprietary properties  the company s future success will also be dependent upon its ability to procure licenses for additional popular intellectual properties 
there is intense competition for such licenses  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in acquiring additional intellectual property rights with significant commercial value 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyrights  trade secret laws  patent and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other copy protection methods to protect its product and proprietary rights 
it is the company s policy that all employees and third party developers sign nondisclosure agreements 
there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to protect the company s intellectual property rights against infringement 
the company has shrinkwrap license agreements with the end users of its multimedia pc titles  but the company relies on the copyright laws to prevent unauthorized distribution of its other software 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
however  notwithstanding the company s rights to its software  it may be possible for third parties to copy illegally the company s titles or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
illegal copying occurs within the software industry  and if a significant amount of illegal copying of the company s published titles or titles distributed by it were to occur  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
policing illegal use of the company s titles is difficult  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
further  the laws of certain countries in which the company s titles are or may be distributed do not protect the company and its intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company believes that its software  trademarks and other proprietary rights do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  as the number of titles in the industry increases  the company believes that claims and lawsuits with respect to software infringement will increase 
from time to time  third parties have asserted that features or content of certain of the company s titles may infringe upon intellectual property rights of such parties  and the company has asserted that third parties have likewise infringed the company s proprietary rights  certain of these claims have resulted in litigation by and against the company 
to date  no such claims have had an adverse effect on the company s ability to develop  market or sell its titles 
there can be no assurance that existing or future infringement claims by or against the company will not result in costly litigation or require the company to license the intellectual property rights of third parties 
see legal proceedings 
the owners of intellectual property licensed by the company generally reserve the right to protect such intellectual property against infringement 
see business intellectual property licenses 
international sales international sales represented approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues in future periods 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other economic barriers  fluctuating exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
because the company believes exposure to foreign currency losses is not currently material  the company currently has no formal financial instruments in place as a hedge against foreign currency risks 
in some markets  localization of the company s titles is essential to achieve market penetration 
the company may incur incremental costs and experience delays in localizing its titles 
these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
new business ventures during the last three years  the company has completed acquisitions  or has commenced operations  of various new businesses including i the publication of comic books  ii the distribution of affiliated labels software  iii the marketing of its motion capture technology and studio services and iv the distribution of coin operated video games 
the company also acquired three software studios in calendar the company made significant investments and incurred significant expenses in connection with the acquisition establishment of such businesses in fiscal  and  and anticipates that it will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with certain of the operations thereof 
to date  except for sales of affiliated labels software in fiscal  which accounted for approximately of the company s gross revenues in that period  and sales of titles such as turok dinosaur hunter developed by the iguana studio  none of such new businesses has generated significant revenues and there can be no assurance that such businesses will generate significant revenues or the timing thereof 
to the extent the company continues to incur material expenses in connection with such ventures during periods when they do not generate significant revenues  the company s results of operations and profitability will be materially adversely affected 
dependence on key personnel and employees the interactive entertainment industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel with technical  marketing  sales  product development and management skills 
the ability to identify  hire and retain such personnel is essential to the company s success 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to attract and retain such personnel or that it will not experience significant cost increases in order to do so 
in particular  the company is highly dependent upon the management services of gregory fischbach  co chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and james scoroposki  co chairman of the board and senior executive vice president  of the company 
the loss of the services of any of the company s senior management could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company has employment agreements with messrs 
fischbach and scoroposki  there can be no assurance that such employees will not leave or compete with the company 
the company s failure to attract additional qualified employees or to retain the services of key personnel could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions the company s board of directors has the authority subject to certain limitations imposed by the indenture to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the designations  preferences and rights and the qualifications or restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate actions  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
in addition  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl 
in general  this statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
employment arrangements with certain members of the company s management provide for severance payments upon termination of their employment after a change in control of the company as defined in such agreements 
see employment employment agreements and description of capital stock 
volatility of stock price there has been a history of significant volatility in the market prices of companies engaged in the software industry  including the company 
it is likely that the market price of the common stock will continue to be highly volatile 
factors such as the timing and market acceptance of product introductions by the company  the introduction of products by the company s competitors  loss of key personnel of the company  variations in quarterly operating results or changes in market conditions in the software industry generally may have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock 
in the past  the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its operating results and  if the company s future revenues or operating results or product releases do not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of the common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the stock market has experienced and continues to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of software companies and companies in the interactive entertainment industry and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
see market price of and dividends on the company s common equity and related matters 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods

the company operates its own software design studios and a motion capture studio  and markets and distributes its software in the major territories throughout the world 
the company s operating strategy is to develop software for the entertainment platforms and multimedia pcs that dominate the interactive entertainment market at a given time or which the company perceives as having the potential for achieving mass market acceptance 
the company s strategy is to emphasize sports simulation and arcade style titles for entertainment platforms  and fantasy role playing  adventure and sports simulation titles for multimedia pcs 
the company intends to continue to support its existing key brands such as turok dinosaur hunter  nfl quarterback club  world wrestling federation and nba jam with the introduction of new titles supporting those brands and to develop one or more additional key brands each year based on its original and licensed properties  which may then be featured on an annual basis in successive titles 
the company also engages in i the development and publication of comic books  ii the distribution of software titles developed by other software publishers  iii the marketing of its motion capture technology and studio services  and iv the development  marketing and distribution of coin operated video arcade games 
the software industry is driven by the size of the installed base of entertainment platforms  such as those manufactured by nintendo  sony and sega  and multimedia pcs 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change  resulting in hardware platform and related software product cycles 
no single hardware platform or system has achieved long term dominance in the interactive entertainment market 
the rapid technological advances in game systems have significantly changed the look and feel of software as well as the software development process 
according to company estimates  the average development cost for a title for entertainment platforms and multimedia pcs is currently between million and million  an increase over the average development cost for a title on earlier generation entertainment platforms 
as a result of the company s acquisitions of iguana  sculptured and probe in two of which were completed in fiscal  the company s general and administrative expenses were substantially higher in fiscal and fiscal as compared to prior periods 
see risk factors 
such expenses in the aggregate had a material adverse impact on the company s profitability in fiscal and fiscal the company recorded a loss from operations of million and a net loss on an after tax basis of million for fiscal the net loss for the year reflects  among other things  a charge of million for certain claims and litigations for which the settlement obligation is currently probable and estimable  a write down of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with acclaim comics to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  and downsizing charges of million 
as a result of the industry transition to and bit entertainment platforms  the company s software sales during fiscal and fiscal were significantly lower than in fiscal in addition  although the company had acquired three software studios and had incurred increases in fixed overhead expenses  due to software development lead times  the capacity of the studios to develop titles to be marketed by the company soon after their acquisition was limited  and the company continued to rely on independent studios for the development of its titles and incurred royalty and other expenses relating thereto 
accordingly  in fiscal  management effected certain measures  including expense reductions and consolidation of certain operations  to align its operating expenses with anticipated revenues 
see operating expenses 
management believes  based on publicly available information and its own estimates  that the installed base of and bit entertainment platforms was approximately million and million units at the end of calendar and at september   respectively 
although management anticipates that such installed base will be approximately million units by the end of calendar and that the company s revenues in fiscal from sales of software therefor will be higher than in fiscal  the company s revenues from sales of software for the new entertainment platforms in fiscal will not be comparable to its revenues from sales of bit software in fiscal or no assurance can be given as to the future growth of the installed base of and bit entertainment platforms or of the company s results of operations and profitability in future periods 
see risk factors 
based on information available in and based on its historical experience with respect to the transition from bit to bit platforms  the company believed that software sales for bit platforms would  although continuing to decrease overall  still dominate the interactive entertainment market in and that such sales would remain substantial through the holiday season 
accordingly  although the company s strategy for the christmas season was to develop software for multiple entertainment platforms and multimedia pcs  the company anticipated that substantially all of its revenues in fiscal would be derived from its bit software sales 
the company also anticipated that its sales of bit and multimedia pc software in fiscal would grow as compared to fiscal but that the majority of its revenues in fiscal would still be derived from bit software sales 
however  the bit software market matured much more rapidly than anticipated by the company  the company s christmas bit software sales were substantially lower than anticipated and  by april  the company derived minimal profits from such software sales and made the decision to exit the bit and portable cartridge markets 
in connection with the company s decision to exit the bit and portable software markets in april  the company recorded a special cartridge video charge of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal  consisting of provisions of approximately million reflected in net revenues  and approximately million reflected in cost of revenues  respectively  to adjust accounts receivable and inventories at february  to their estimated net realizable values in conjunction with management s decision to exit the portable and bit cartridge market 
the company recorded a loss from operations of million and a net loss on an after tax basis of million for fiscal the net loss for the year reflected write offs of receivables  the establishment of additional receivables and inventory reserves  severance charges incurred in connection with the downsizing of the company and the reduction of certain deferred costs  as well as an operating loss for the year resulting primarily from price protection and similar concessions granted to retailers at greater than anticipated levels in connection with the company s bit and bit software 
see risk factors 
the company has released  and may continue to release  bit and or portable software selectively to support its key brands and  if requested by a retailer  may produce additional units of particular title s on a special order basis 
bit and portable software revenue represented of gross revenues for the year ended august  the company s ability to generate sales growth and profitability will be primarily dependent on the growth of the software market for and bit entertainment platforms and multimedia pcs  the company s ability to identify  develop and publish hit software for entertainment platforms with significant installed bases and multimedia pcs  the success of the company s cost reduction efforts and its ability to develop and publish commercially viable titles after giving effect to such efforts and  to a lesser extent  the development of  and the generation of revenues from  the company s other entertainment operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statements of consolidated operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended august  domestic revenues foreign revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss selling  advertising  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating interest depreciation and amortization goodwill writedown litigation settlements downsizing charge total operating expenses loss earnings from operations other income expense  net loss earnings before income taxes net loss earnings net revenues the company s gross revenues were derived from the following product categories portable software bit software bit software bit software multimedia pc software other the numbers in this chart do not give effect to sales credits and allowances granted by the company in the periods covered since the company does not track such credits and allowances by product category 
such credits and allowances were material to the company s results of operations in fiscal accordingly  the numbers presented may vary materially from those that would be disclosed if the company were able to present such information as a percentage of net revenues 
the increase in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to sales of the company s n title  turok dinosaur hunter  and lower returns and allowances 
the decrease in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to reduced unit sales of bit software  increased returns and allowances relating primarily to bit software and a reduction in average unit selling prices for bit software 
the company s revenues and operating results in fiscal and reflect principally the industry transition from bit to and bit entertainment platforms 
management believes  based on publicly available information and its own estimates  that the installed base of and bit entertainment platforms was approximately million and million units at the end of calendar and at september   respectively 
although management anticipates that such installed base will be approximately million units by the end of calendar and that the company s revenues in fiscal from sales of software therefor will be higher than in fiscal  the company s revenues from sales of software for the new entertainment platforms in fiscal will not be comparable to its revenues from sales of bit software in fiscal or no assurance can be given as to the future growth of the installed base of and bit entertainment platforms or of the company s results of operations and profitability in future periods 
in fiscal  the company effected a variety of cost reduction measures to reduce its operating expenses 
although the company realized the benefits of such measures in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the form of reduced operating expenses as compared to prior quarters  no assurance can be given that such measures will not materially adversely affect the company s ability to develop and publish commercially viable titles  or that such measures  whether alone or in conjunction with increased revenues  if any  will be sufficient to generate operating profits in fiscal and beyond 
see risk factors 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter are generally derived from software first released in that quarter or in the immediately preceding quarter 
in fiscal  sales of turok dinosaur hunter accounted for approximately of the company s gross revenues 
in fiscal  no single title accounted for a significant portion of the company s gross revenues and  in fiscal  sales of nba jam tournament edition accounted for approximately of the company s gross revenues

gross profit gross profit fluctuates as a result of three factors i the number of hit titles and average unit selling prices of the company s inventory  ii the company s product mix ie  the percentage of sales of multimedia pc software and software for cd based entertainment platforms as compared to sales of software for cartridge based entertainment platforms  and iii the percentage of foreign sales to third party distributors 
all royalties payable to nintendo  sony and sega are included in cost of revenues 
the company s gross profit is adversely impacted by increases in the level of returns and allowances to retailers  which reduces the average unit price obtained for its software sales 
similarly  lack of hit titles or a low number of hit titles  resulting in lower average unit sales prices  adversely impacts the company s gross profits 
the company s margins on sales of multimedia pc and other cd software currently  the bit sony playstation and sega saturn platforms are higher than those on cartridge software currently  the nintendo n and gameboy platforms as a result of significantly lower cd software costs 
the company s margins on foreign software sales to third party distributors are approximately one third lower than those on sales that the company makes directly to foreign retailers 
gross profit increased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  primarily due to lower levels of returns and allowances 
gross profit decreased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to a gross loss of million of net revenues for the year ended august  primarily due to increased returns and allowances relating to bit software 
management anticipates that the company s future gross profit will be affected principally by i the percentage of returns  sales credits and allowances and other similar concessions in respect of the company s software sales and ii the company s product mix 
the company purchases substantially all of its software other than software sold in japan at prices payable in united states dollars 
appreciation of the yen could result in increased prices charged by sony  sega or nintendo to the company although  to date  none of them has effected such a price increase  which the company may not be able to pass on to its customers and which could adversely affect its results of operations 
operating expenses selling  advertising  general and administrative expenses decreased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  the decrease is primarily attributable to personnel and other cost reduction efforts initiated by the company to reduce its operating expenses

research and development expenses increased from million of net revenues in fiscal to million of net revenues in fiscal due to the increase in software development resulting from the acquisition of the three software studios in calendar a substantial portion of such expenses were previously included as royalties paid to independent software studios 
operating interest expense decreased from million of net revenues for the year ended august  to million of net revenues for the year ended august  the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales volume and the resulting lower outstanding balances under the company s principal credit facility 
operating interest expense increased from million of net revenues for fiscal to million of net revenues for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to higher outstanding balances under the company s principal credit facility 
depreciation and amortization increased from million of net revenue for fiscal to million of net revenues for fiscal and to million of net revenues for fiscal the increase in both years is primarily attributable to depreciation relating to fixed assets held by the software studios and to the reduction  in fiscal  of the estimated remaining life of goodwill relating to acclaim comics from forty to twenty years 
downsizing charges of approximately million relating primarily to employee severance  lease commitments for idle facilities and write offs of non productive fixed assets were recorded in fiscal management believes that the company has begun to realize operating expense reductions resulting therefrom commencing in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to continuing operating losses incurred by acclaim comics  management s assessment of the current state of the comic book industry and management s current projections for acclaim comics operations  in fiscal  management believed that there was an impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill relating to acclaim comics 
accordingly  in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a write down of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with acclaim comics to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
in conjunction with certain claims and litigations for which the settlement obligation is currently probable and estimable see business recent developments  risk factors litigation and legal proceedings  the company recorded a charge of million during the year ended august  no assurance can be given that the company will not be required to record additional material charges in future periods in conjunction with the various litigations to which the company is a party
