worldwide sales of the company s impact products declined  or million in fiscal this decline was spread throughout the company s worldwide markets as sales of the company s impact products declined nearly and  in north america and europe  respectively 
the company expects the market for impact supplies to continue to decline as non impact printing devices become more popular and replace many of the impact printers now in service 
however  the company intends to mitigate the effect of the reduction in the market for impact supplies by transferring production of the products to its manufacturing facilities in mexico and china and by expanding into markets such as asia with products manufactured in china 
after growing steadily from less than million in worldwide sales in fiscal to over million in worldwide sales in fiscal  sales of non impact products declined nearly in fiscal and amounted to million 
even though sales of toner products declined nearly in fiscal  sales of non impact products in north america were million in both fiscal and  as sales of ink jet and laser products grew in excess of in fiscal the decline in toner sales in north america was due in part to the company s decision to reduce sales of recharger toners in non profitable markets  delays in introduction of certain new products due to patent infringement issues  and quality issues resulting from the consolidation of toner formulas at its two north american toner facilities 
in europe  non impact sales amounted to million  a decline of million over fiscal sales 
approximately one third of the decline in european non impact sales was due to exchange rate fluctuation  another one third was due to price reductions in the first quarter of fiscal which did not result in increased sales 
the remaining decline in non impact sales was due to a decline in sales volumes 
the company expects that for the foreseeable future it will continue to experience pressures for increased sales allowances from office supply superstores and other mass market retailers as the marketplace in north america continues to experience consolidations within distribution channels 
in addition  in fiscal  the company began to experience market pressures for increased sales allowances from oems and from office supply superstores that are now selling in europe 
at the same time  the company continues to experience worldwide price competition from small manufacturers that reduce prices in order to maintain market share 
the company believes that the total market for supplies of non impact printers and copiers will continue to expand as new non impact printing technologies become available 
furthermore  the company believes that  as a result of its commitment to research and development  it will be able to increase its sales of non impact supplies by introducing new products such as its pelikan easy click and nu kote cartridge plus systems 
however  the company expects that over the first half of fiscal  the growth in sales of non impact products will not be sufficient to offset the decline in sales of impact supplies 
management is optimistic that sales of pelikan easy click and nu kote cartridge plus systems will continue to grow  thereby more than offsetting the decline in sales of impact products in the second half of fiscal and future years

many of the components of the plan have been or are in the process of being implemented 
although there can be no assurance that actual results will meet the plan  management is closely monitoring performance in relation to the plan

as a result of its general inability to pass along cost increases with respect to its impact printing supplies  future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
because of the expanding market for non impact printing supplies  management currently believes that inflation will have less impact on the companys non impact operations
