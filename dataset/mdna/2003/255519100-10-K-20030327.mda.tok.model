item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview during the three year period ended december   we acquired fabrica international fabrica together with a interest in chroma systems partners chroma 
we also sold our carpet yarn extrusion operation  two dyeing facilities  a carpet yarn plant and a number of assets that were not part of our floorcovering operations 
our business principally consists of manufacturing  selling and distributing products for the soft floorcovering industry 
these businesses are segmented between floorcovering products and floorcovering base materials carpet yarns 
our floorcovering products operations supply carpet and rugs to high end residential and high end commercial customers through fabrica international and masland carpets 
our north georgia carpet operations supply high end tufted products to residential customers through dixie home and tufted and needlebond floorcovering products to the factory built and modular housing  recreational vehicle and exposition trade show markets through carriage carpets and to consumers through major retailers under the bretlin  globaltex and private label brands 
our carpet yarn operations supply plied and heat set filament and spun yarns primarily to our carpet manufacturing business and  to a lesser extent  to external specialty carpet yarn markets through candlewick yarns 
during  we initiated an extensive restructuring effort in our north georgia carpet business to address a number of problems that were negatively impacting operations 
we had made several acquisitions that were not promptly assimilated  which led to an inefficient operating structure with overlapping management responsibilities 
in addition  we experienced difficulty supporting rapid growth due to an aggressive expansion of our home center sales 
at the same time  demand for carpet by the factory built and modular housing industry significantly declined 
we responded to these issues with a strategy aimed at simplifying our operations and reorganizing our north georgia business under one management structure 
the reorganization reduced employment at all levels  including  salaried personnel and allowed us to gain better control of operations and to reduce cost  inventory  and debt 
we also consolidated three tufting operations into one facility  the production of three dyeing operations into one facil ity and multiple distribution centers into one facility 
two smaller dyeing facilities were sold and three information systems were combined 
from june  through the end of  we achieved the following results a reduction in workforce and a reduction in inventories 
from its high point in august  we reduced debt million  or including amounts advanced under our prior accounts receivable securitization program 
the dollar volumes and percentages of our net sales to the home depot were approximately million  or  in  million  or  in  and million  or  in the loss of the home depot business could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are often beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made in preparing the financial statements 
the sec issued disclosure guidance for accounting policies that management identifies as most critical 
these critical accounting policies  as determined in accordance with the sec guidance  are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about inherently uncertain matters that may change in subsequent periods 
we believe the following accounting policies require us to use significant judgments and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and represent our critical accounting policies as described above 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when legal title passes to the customer  which is at the time goods are shipped 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluation of the financial condition of our customers and the collectability of our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay their debts  allowances recorded in our financial statements may not be adequate 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which matches current costs with current revenues 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which is based on historical usage  in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of inventory related to inventory that is less than first quality  obsolete or excessive are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of our specified reporting units by estimating the reporting units future cash flows  which requires management judgments and assumptions about future economic factors that are difficult to predict and often beyond management s control 
these judgments and assumptions could materially change the value of the specified reporting units and  therefore  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the future periods in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the effective date of the change 
also  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could have tax effects on such items going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain elements of our operating results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses other income expense net operating income results for the years ended december   december   and december  were affected by a number of unusual gains and losses associated with facility consolidations  plant shutdowns  workforce reductions  asset sales and asset write downs 
the following table summarizes the increase decrease in operating income  by cost category  as a result of these unusual items for each period presented fiscal year ended december  december  december  dollars in millions cost of sales selling and administrative expenses other income expense net net increase decrease in operating income excluding the effect of these unusual items described above  the following table sets forth certain elements of our operating results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses other income expense net operating income fiscal year ended december   compared with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decline of from million for the year ended december  sales in our carpet business declined 
carpet sales for the year ended december  were very soft in our home center mass merchant markets principally due to a significant decline in sales to the home depot  and also soft in commercial markets 
sales improved in our high end residential markets and factory built and modular housing markets  compared with levels 
sales in our carpet yarn business declined 
the lower carpet yarn sales reflect our strategy to de emphasize our external carpet yarn sales to supply raw materials to support our carpet operations 
our carpet manufacturing operations utilized approximately of our carpet yarn production in the fiscal year cost of sales 
despite the decline in sales  cost of sales decreased significantly as a percentage of sales in both our carpet and carpet yarn businesses 
as a result  gross margin increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this improvement is principally attributable to cost reduction programs implemented during the year ending december  to reduce our workforce  and improve efficiencies and asset utilization 
we also increased the portion of our total sales derived from higher margin products during fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million million  excluding severance costs incurred in in the twelve month period ended december   compared with the same period in these costs as a percentage of sales were slightly higher in as a result of lower sales 
other income expense net 
other income expense net reflected a lower level of net gains from asset sales in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  excluding the non recurring net gains of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  other income expense net improved million 
the improvement in fiscal is principally due to the elimination of goodwill amortization and the reduction in expenses associated with our prior accounts receivable securitization program 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased for the year ended december   compared with the same period in due to lower levels of debt 
income tax provision benefit 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to the relationship of non deductible goodwill amortization and other non deductible costs to pre tax earnings in each of these reporting periods 
additionally  the year included an income tax benefit of million due to a contribution deduction  for income tax purposes  related to the sale of a carpet yarn facility that was closed 
net income 
income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  and included a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  to fully reserve a note received in when we sold our cotton yarn and dyeing textile operations 
this compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal fiscal year ended december   compared with fiscal ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  down from million for the year ended december  our fiscal year included operating weeks versus operating weeks in the fiscal year 
the acquisition of fabrica on july  increased fiscal year carpet sales by million compared with fiscal year excluding fabrica s sales and adjusting for the number of operating weeks in each fiscal year  carpet sales declined 
the most significant decline in our fiscal carpet sales was in the factory built and modular housing market  where sales declined over 
our sales to the factory built and modular housing industry began showing positive comparisons to the prior fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal during  external carpet yarn sales declined 
the decline in our external carpet yarn sales reflects our strategy to de emphasize our external carpet yarn sales to supply raw materials to support our carpet operations and softness in demand for carpet yarns throughout the carpet industry 
our carpet manufacturing operations  in fiscal  utilized approximately of our carpet yarn production 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales significantly declined in the fiscal year due to the effect on our cost structure of the consolidation of our north georgia carpet operations  the acquisition of fabrica on july  and the unusual costs incurred in the fiscal year as a result  gross margin increased to for the fiscal year ended december   compared to for the fiscal year ended december  selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million in the fiscal year  compared with the fiscal year this decrease reflects an million increase in cost due to a full year of fabrica s results being included in the fiscal year  which was more than offset by a million reduction in cost in our other operations and a million reduction in costs related to the restructuring and consolidation of operations in the fiscal year as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased due to the lower net sales and higher selling and administrative costs associated with fabrica s high end business 
other income expense net 
other income expense net improved to million of income for the fiscal year  compared with million of income for the fiscal year this change is principally the result of larger net gains from the sale of assets in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased in fiscal due to higher interest rates 
income tax provision benefit 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal and a benefit of for fiscal the effective tax rates differ from the statutory tax rates principally due to the relationship of non deductible goodwill amortization and other non deductible expenses to pre tax earnings in each fiscal year and due to net operating losses that could not be carried back to prior years for state income tax purposes in fiscal net income 
net income for the fiscal year ending december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with a loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ending december  the net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  and included a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources on may   we entered into a secured revolving credit and term loan facility to replace our prior senior credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program 
the credit facility provided revolving credit of up to million through a five year commitment period and a million term loan 
on march   we issued million of senior secured notes  amended our senior credit facility and settled the million obligation that was due in april to the former shareholders of fabrica international 
the fabrica obligation was settled through a cash payment of million  reflecting an early payment discount 
interest on the senior secured notes is payable monthly in cash at libor plus  or  if libor is unavailable  at a base rate plus  in either event not to exceed during the last fifteen months prior to the maturity of the notes  plus a per annum payment in kind pik interest component which is settled quarterly by the addition of the accrued pik interest to the notes principal balance then outstanding 
the outstanding principal and all accrued and unpaid interest is due at maturity of the notes on may  the notes rank pari passu with all of our senior indebtedness and are secured by a second priority lien in substantially all of our assets  junior only to liens we granted to secure borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility and the senior secured notes are senior to our subordinated debt 
the amended senior credit facility reduced the revolving credit loan commitments to million and increased amounts that can be borrowed under our borrowing base formula by approximately million 
the existing term loan was reissued at its outstanding balance and an additional million term loan was issued  bringing the aggregate balance of the term loan portion of the facility to million 
the term loans are payable in quarterly installments of million beginning may  and are due in may interest rates available under the amended senior facility may be selected from a number of options that effectively allow for borrowing at rates ranging from the lender s prime rate plus 
to the lender s prime rate plus for base rate loans  or at rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus for libor loans 
commitment fees  ranging from 
to 
per annum  are payable on the average daily unused balance of the revolving credit faci lity 
the level of our accounts receivable and inventories limits borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility 
the senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien in substantially all of our assets 
our credit agreements contain financial covenants relating to fixed charges  interest and debt coverage and net worth and among other things  limit future acquisitions and sales of assets  capital expenditures  and the payment of dividends 
after completing the transactions  including payment of the obligation to the former shareholders of fabrica international  the unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility was million 
during the three year period ended december   cash flows generated from operating activities excluding amounts advanced under our prior accounts receivable securitization were million 
these funds were supplemented by million from asset sales and million from highly liquid investments 
during this three year period  funds were used to finance our operations  and to invest million in capital assets and million in business acquisitions  and to retire including amounts advanced under our prior accounts receivable securitization million of debt 
proceeds from the sale of assets were million in  million in  and million in the assets sold consisted primarily of an extrusion operation and a carpet yarn facility in  and real estate in and machinery  dyeing facilities and real estate in the assets sold in included million for machinery and equipment that were leased back to us under an operating lease for a period of four years at an annual lease cost of million 
we have an option to extend the lease for an additional year 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year were million  while depreciation and amortization was million 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million or less for the fiscal year while depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
the fabrica asset purchase agreement also provides for an additional contingent amount of up to million to be paid in april if fabrica s cumulative earnings before interest and taxes for the five year period beginning january exceed certain levels 
we expect that any contingent payments that may become due under the cumulative earnings test would be treated as additional costs of the acquisition 
the acquisition of our interest in chroma systems partners in is subject to a purchase price adjustment generally equal to our share of chroma s income or loss for the three years ending june   less million 
a significant portion of the amounts due by us as a result of this adjustment is paid monthly 
the acquisition of multitex corporation of america  inc globaltex provides for certain contingent obligations related to revenue growth of a specific customer through such obligations were million  million  and million for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
we believe our operating cash flows  proceeds from the senior notes issued on march  and credit availability under the amended senior credit facility are adequate to finance our normal liquidity requirements 
the following table contains a summary of the company s future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period thereafter total dollars in millions long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase commitments recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial standards no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas provides that goodwill and certain other intangible assets no longer will be amortized but be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas applies to all existing goodwill and intangible assets  beginning with fiscal years starting after december  during  we tested our year end goodwill for impairment and determined that there was no indication of impairment 
goodwill was also tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of and there was no indication of impairment 
at december   our unamortized goodwill amounted to  representing of total assets 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  which contains provisions that supercede previously issued accounting pronouncements 
among such provisions was new guidance related to income statement classification for debt extinguishment costs 
adoption is required for companies with fiscal years beginning after may   with early adoption encouraged 
we adopted the provisions of sfas during the quarter ended june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
during  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternate methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on the reporting of net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  sfas amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about these effects in interim financial information 
the annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  certain factors affecting the company s performance in addition to the other information provided in this report  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating results of our operations  future prospects and an investment in shares of our common stock 
any of these factors could cause our actual financial results during any period to differ materially from our historical results  and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity  corporate remodeling and refurbishment  or in the factory built housing industry  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the us floorcovering industry is cyclical and is influenced by a number of general economic factors 
the floorcovering industry in general is dependent on residential and commercial construction activity  including new construction as well as remodeling 
in addition  sales of certain of the company s principal products are significantly influenced by sales of factory built housing  recreational vehicles and yachts 
new construction activity  as well as sales in the factory built housing  recreational vehicle and yachting industries  all are cyclical in nature 
to a somewhat lesser degree  this also is true with residential and commercial remodeling 
a prolonged decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the level of activity in these industries is significantly affected by numerous factors  all of which are beyond the our control  including consumer confidence  housing demand  financing availability  national and local economic conditions  interest rates  employment levels  changes in disposable income  commercial rental vacancy rates  and federal and state income tax policies 
we believe we are the largest producer of carpeting for the factory built housing industry 
approximately of our total net sales being made to customers in the factory built and modular housing industries 
production in the factory built housing industry significantly declined during the years and and remained at depressed levels throughout there are indications that conditions in the industry could further deteriorate before they improve 
the us construction  factory built housing and other industries have experienced significant downturns in the past  which have adversely affected suppliers to these industries  including suppliers of floorcoverings 
these industries could experience similar downturns in the future  which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
the floorcovering industry is highly competitive 
we face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and  in certain product areas  foreign manufacturers 
there has been a significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry during recent years which has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to be larger and have greater resources and access to capital than we do 
maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial investments in our product development efforts  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities  which may be limited by restrictions set forth in our credit facilities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products and in the loss of market share 
in addition  we face  and will continue to face  pressure on sales prices of our products from competitors 
as a result of any of these factors  there could be a material ad verse effect on our sales and profitability 
the loss of our business with the home depot  inc could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
sales to the home depot  inc represented approximately of the total dollar volume of our sales in the fiscal year we believe that our relationship with the home depot is good  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this relationship 
our reliance on the home depot may significantly influence our negotiations with them 
we do not have long term contracts with the home depot  and there can be no assurance that the home depot will continue to purchase our products in historical quantities or at all 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  this business could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
raw material prices may increase 
the cost of raw materials has a significant impact on our profitability 
in particular our business requires the purchase of large volumes of nylon fiber  filament  synthetic backing  polyester  polypropylene  wool fibers  latex and dyes 
increases in the cost of these raw materials could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass these increases through to our customers 
prices of raw materials have increased in early and additional increases have been announced for many raw materials we use 
we believe we will be successful in increasing prices to pass along raw material and other costs  however  it could take several months to recoup these increases in the marketplace  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully recover such raw material price increases 
unanticipated termination or interruption of our arrangements with third party suppliers of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on us 
nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products 
the unanticipated termination or interruption of our supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be responsible for environmental cleanup costs 
various federal  state and local environmental laws govern the use of our facilities 
these laws govern such matters as discharges to air and water  handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste  and remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off site disposal locations 
our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace 
we have taken and will continue to take steps to comply with these laws 
if we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities 
however  we cannot insure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
future laws  ordinances or regulations could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
acts of terrorism 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of international conflicts or acts of terrorism 
terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our facilities  employees  customers  suppliers  and distributors  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
such conflicts also may cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment  including receipt of supplies and distribution of product 
forward looking information this report contains statements that may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements include the use of terms or phrases that include such terms as expects  estimated  projects  believes  anticipates  intends  and similar terms and phrases 
such terms or phrases relate to  among other matters  our future financial performance  business prospects  growth  strategies or liquidity 
the following important factors may affect our future results of and could cause those results to differ materially from our historical results 
these risks include  in addition to those detailed above under the heading certain factors affecting the company s performance  the cost and availability of capital  raw material and transportation costs related to petroleum price levels  the cost and availability of energy supplies  the loss of a significant custom er or group of customers  materially adverse changes in economic conditions generally in carpet  rug and floorcovering markets we serve and other risks detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is party to interest rate swap agreements through march  under the interest rate swap agreements  the company pays a fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount  and receives in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal 
the interest rate swap agreements fair value is reflected on the balance sheet and related gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   the company had an interest rate swap agreement outstanding for  under the terms of the swap agreement  the company paid a fixed rate of interest of through march  and will pay thereafter 
any interest rate differential realized is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap agreement 
unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  were  net of taxes 
during  losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by amounts that were reclassified into earnings in the amount of  net of taxes  and increased by  net of taxes  related to a new interest rate swap agreement 
this activity resulted in net unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss of  net of taxes  at december  during the next months  the company expects this cost to impact earnings approximately  net of taxes 
based on the company s  interest rate swap agreement  a fluctuation in the variable rate would result in an annual after tax economic impact of approximately
