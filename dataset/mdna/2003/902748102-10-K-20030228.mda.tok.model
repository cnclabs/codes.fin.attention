overview and strategy uil holdings corporation uil holdings is the parent holding company for the united illuminating company ui and united resources  inc uri 
uil holdings is an exempt public utility holding company under the provisions of the public utility holding company act of in connection with the restructuring in connecticut of the regulated electric utility industry  ui was required to divest its ownership interests in generation facilities 
as explained below  ui s earnings are also expected to decline as recovery of stranded costs is completed 
in the next several years  despite a gradual decline  ui is expected to provide the majority of uil holdings earnings and cash flow 
uil holdings strategy has been to invest in non utility businesses that could generate earnings to replace an anticipated decline in the earnings of ui resulting from the divestiture of its generation assets 
as of december   uil holdings has invested million in uri 
uri serves as the parent company for uil holdings four non utility businesses  each of which is wholly owned 
uri s four subsidiaries are american payment systems  inc aps  xcelecom  inc 
xcelecom  united capital investments  inc uci  and united bridgeport energy  inc ube 
ui is a regulated operating electric public utility established in it is engaged principally in the purchase  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity for residential  commercial and industrial purposes in a service area of about square miles in the southwestern part of the state of connecticut 
the service area is mature  with modest growth both in the number of customers and use of electricity 
situated in the service area  which is primarily urban and suburban  are retail trade and service centers  as well as large and small industries producing a wide variety of products  including helicopters and other transportation equipment  electrical equipment  chemicals and pharmaceuticals 
of ui s retail electric revenues  approximately were derived from residential sales  from commercial sales  from industrial sales and from other sales 
over the next five years ui will significantly increase capital spending for transmission projects 
this is driven primarily by the need to provide additional transmission capacity in southwest connecticut  which is one of the most congested  or transmission constrained  areas in the united states 
these projects will enhance network reliability and provide for future growth and the resultant demand on the electric infrastructure in southwest connecticut 
transmission projects are subject to various legal and regulatory approvals  which have not yet been obtained and which could affect the scope  timing and cost of the projects 
on january   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that  if adopted  will provide for incentive rates of return on certain transmission projects 
this proposal is intended to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure and enhance the interoperability of the electric grid across large regions 
ui is evaluating the opportunity for enhancing its overall return by participating in the transmission projects in southwest connecticut described above  as well as possible participation in the formation and operation of a new england regional transmission organization 
aps provides a variety of financial products and services throughout the united states through its network of approximately  retailers agents in locations in grocery stores  pharmacies  banks and check cashing stores in states

over the last several years  xcelecom has expanded its business by pursuing an aggressive acquisition program 
due to the effects of the economic downturn on xcelecom s business  in addition to the lack of available and potentially desirable acquisitions  xcelecom plans to slow the pace of its acquisition program 
this may result in xcelecom not completing any acquisitions in uci has a interest in cross sound cable company  llc cross sound  which owns and proposes to operate a megawatt transmission line connecting connecticut and long island under long island sound

major influences on financial condition uil holdings corporation uil holdings financial condition and financing capability will be dependent on many factors  including the level of income and cash flow of uil holdings subsidiaries  conditions in the securities markets  economic conditions  interest rates  legislative and regulatory developments and regulations and the ability to retain key personnel 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could have an adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations for uil holdings operating subsidiaries ui  xcelecom and aps 
these operations depend on the continued efforts of its current and future executive officers  senior management and management personnel 
xcelecom has acquired a number of companies in the past 
the success of these acquisitions is dependent on the continued involvement of the operating management of these entities 
uil holdings cannot guarantee that any member of management at the corporate or subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time 
if uil holdings were to lose a number of key personnel  its operations could be adversely affected 
the united illuminating company ui is an electric transmission and distribution utility  whose rates and allowed return on equity are regulated by the ferc and the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
the primary factors affecting the financial results of ui are sales volume and ability to control expenses 
the two primary factors that affect electric utility sales volume are economic conditions and weather 
the major expense components are purchased power  amortization of stranded costs  wages and benefits  depreciation  and interest 
in november  as directed by the dpuc  ui filed a retail customer rate case application and supporting schedules and pre filed testimony with the dpuc rate case 
the dpuc issued a final decision in the rate case proceeding that became effective on september  the decision provides for a million reduction in ui s annual revenue requirements  including a million reduction to ui s customer rates  million to be applied annually for additional funding of conservation programs  million to be applied annually to reduce stranded costs  and million to be applied to a combination of uncollectibles  taxes and rate base changes 
customer rates were reduced by overall 
the final rate case decision establishes rates on the basis of an authorized return on equity of  excluding ui s investment in transmission facilities 
earnings above the authorized return are to be shared to customers and to retained earnings  with the customers share divided equally between bill reductions and an accelerated amortization of stranded costs 
the rate case decision did not adopt or impose a multi year rate plan 
the rate case decision recognizes that the revenue requirements determination for transmission investment  including the applicable return on equity  is within the jurisdiction of the ferc 
ui s authorized return on equity for transmission investment is 
following a work stoppage by ui s unionized employees from may  to june   ui and the union entered into a three year contract that provides for average annual wage increases of 
in addition to wage and salary increases  the cost of health care and pension benefits have increased and are expected to continue to increase in the future 
on november   ui filed with the dpuc a request that the dpuc reopen the rate case decision to adjust ui s revenue requirements for increased pension and postretirement benefits expenses in in excess of the amount approved in the rate case 
pension and postretirement benefits expenses are expected to increase dramatically above levels approved in the rate case decision due to poor equity market performance and the current historically low level of interest rates  both of which have increased ui s pension and postretirement benefits expenses 
on january   the dpuc reopened the rate case proceeding for the limited purpose of determining whether there are changed conditions sufficient to warrant consideration of ui s revenue requirements for pension and postretirement benefits expenses in in february  ui updated the estimate of its expense for these benefits to true up asset values and certain census data for the plan year and to reflect updated assumptions 
as a result  the adjustment to revenue requirements sought by ui has increased to million 
the dpuc has submitted interrogatories relating to the reopened docket and held a technical meeting on february  if the dpuc determines not to address the additional revenue requirements associated with the pension and postretirement benefits expenses  ui intends to initiate a new rate case proceeding as soon as practicable 
absent any other actions  the additional pension and postretirement benefits expenses will prevent ui from earning its authorized rate of return on equity in in april  the connecticut legislature enacted public act the restructuring act  a statute designed to restructure the regulated electric utility industry 
under the restructuring act  all connecticut electricity customers are able to choose their electricity suppliers 
through december   ui is required to offer retail service to its customers under a regulated standard offer rate to each customer who does not choose an alternate electricity supplier  even though ui is no longer in the business of power generation 
ui is also required under the restructuring act to provide back up power supply service to customers whose alternate electricity supplier fails to provide power supply services for reasons other than the customers failure to pay for such services 
on december   ui entered into an agreement with virginia electric and power company vepco for the supply of all of ui s standard offer generation service needs from january  through december   and for the supply of all of ui s generation service requirements for special contract customers through as a result of the implementation of standard market design in new england in  the price of generation in transmission constrained areas may increase 
until december   such costs are included in the contractual price paid by ui under its contract with vepco 
the connecticut general assembly  in its session that began in january  is considering whether to extend the standard offer beyond and  if so  under what terms  and is also considering whether to make other changes to the restructuring legislation 
if standard offer requirements are extended  ui would attempt to enter into a long term power supply agreement similar to the current agreement  consistent with statutory requirements that are expected to be determined by mid ui s agreement with vepco for standard offer generation service replaces an earlier wholesale power agreement and other related agreements with enron power marketing  inc epmi  originally intended to supply all of the power needed to meet ui s standard offer obligations until the end of the standard offer period the agreements 
following epmi s bankruptcy filing on december   ui terminated the agreements in accordance with their terms  effective january   in reliance upon provisions of the bankruptcy code that permit termination of such contracts 
the agreements permitted ui to calculate its gains and losses resulting from the termination  and globally to net these gains and losses against one another  and against any other amounts that ui owed to epmi under the agreements  to arrive at a single sum 
epmi  however  commenced on january  an adversary proceeding against ui and uil holdings in the epmi bankruptcy  enron power marketing  inc 
v 
the united illuminating company  et al  adversary proceeding no 
bankr 
sdny uil holdings was sued as the guarantor of ui s financial obligations under the agreements 
epmi contends that ui was not entitled to offset  against any losses ui suffered from the termination of the agreements  any amounts owing to epmi for power delivered to ui after the date epmi filed for bankruptcy 
the amount of the allegedly improper setoff that epmi seeks to recover in the adversary proceeding is approximately million  plus interest and attorneys fees 
in the event that ui is determined to owe epmi a portion or all of such amount for power delivered after epmi filed for bankruptcy  ui will seek recovery of such amount through the regulatory process 
under the restructuring act  ui is allowed to collect a competitive transition assessment cta to recover costs that have been reasonably incurred  or will be incurred to meet its public service obligations  and that will likely not otherwise be recoverable in a competitive generation and supply market 
these costs include above market long term purchased power contract obligations  regulatory asset recovery and above market investments in power plants so called stranded costs 
a significant amount of ui s earnings are generated by the allowed return on the equity portion of the cta rate base 
the cta rate base earns exactly that return  no more and no less  by adjustments made to amortization expense in each period 
a significant portion of ui s cash flow from operations is also generated from those earnings and from the recovery of the cta rate base 
cta rate base has declined from year to year for a number of reasons including amortization of cta rate base components  the sale of the nuclear units  and any adjustments made through the annual dpuc true up process 
the original rate base component of stranded costs  as of january   was million 
it has since declined to million at year end  million in  and million at year end of the million decrease from to  approximately million was due to the sale of ui s interests in seabrook station 
the result is subject to dpuc review during and may be adjusted in accordance with that review 
from on  cta rate base will likely decline at an accelerating rate due to increasing levels of amortization 
ui s cta earnings will decrease while  based on ui s current projections  cash flow will remain fairly constant until stranded costs are fully amortized by in order to maintain and improve its transmission and distribution system and to provide quality customer service  ui is required to spend a significant amount each year on capital projects 
a large portion of the funds required for capital projects is provided internally through the recovery of depreciation and from amortization of stranded costs 
the remainder must be financed externally

american payment systems  inc 
the three primary risk factors affecting the financial results of aps and its subsidiaries are the ability to recruit and retain agents  the ability to manage and control agent fraud to ensure that the agents are depositing the funds collected from the consumers in a timely fashion and the maintenance of internal control systems and procedures to account for the movement of significant amounts of cash from the agents to aps and on to the biller  on whose behalf the funds are collected 
an additional risk factor is the recoverability and potential for impairment of goodwill 
aps has a formal program in place to recruit and train agents 
the two key elements of aps s agent retention program are offering multiple products ie walk in bill payments  prepaid stored value cards  prepaid telephony products increases the agents commission income  and providing efficient and reliable technology to interface with aps on transaction processing 
upon acceptance of bill payments by its agents  aps guarantees the payments to the billers 
accordingly  aps is at risk for the amount of the payments until it collects such amounts from its agents 
aps receives daily reports from agents with respect to cash collected and deposited into aps owned and agent owned bank accounts field accounts 
cash is swept from the field accounts to aps s concentration account on a daily basis and a substantial portion of the high dollar volume accounts are reconciled on a daily basis 
any variation between cash receipts and amounts deposited in the field accounts are investigated by aps on a daily basis 
aps self insures its agent fraud risk 
aps s ability to make accurate banking transactions is critical to conducting its business and eliminating risk 
aps reviews its internal control systems and procedures to make continual improvements in those systems and procedures to ensure that these controls are maintained in an effective manner 
advances in technology are investigated and implemented to the extent that they will improve the existing internal control systems and procedures 
aps intends to reduce banking fees by reducing the number of bank accounts it maintains and  instead  requiring agents to deposit payments into their own bank accounts 
agents who maintain their own bank accounts are contractually obligated to hold the collected funds in trust for the benefit of the biller 
this strategy will result in a delay of monitoring timely deposits by the agent  which may increase agent fraud risk 
the processing of bill payments also requires aps to implement and maintain a rigorously controlled record keeping system  which is dependent on the employment of a reliable and secure information technology system 
aps is subject to numerous state and federal banking regulations and is required in states where it conducts business to have and maintain money transmitter licenses 
other factors affecting the financial results of aps and its subsidiaries are the pace of technological changes  competition  compliance with federal and state money transmission laws  and attracting and retaining management expertise 
aps s subsidiaries include aps card services  inc csi  which is owned  and cellcards of illinois  llc cci  which is currently owned 
csi has been organized by aps to market a prepaid stored value card to consumers through the aps agent network 
cci  in which aps acquired its ownership interest in april  sells prepaid long distance telephone service  prepaid telephone calling cards and prepaid wireless telephone service in check cashing and convenience store locations nationwide  as well as through aps s network of agents 
aps has the option a call option to purchase the remaining of cci beginning in may  at a price to be determined by a formula based on future sales and earnings performance 
the other owners of cci have the option a put option to require aps to purchase such remaining  beginning in may  or earlier if certain change of control events or management changes occur 
the put and call options together provide a synthetic forward option for the purchase of the remaining of cci by aps 
aps acquired point of sale activation posa technology from a vendor 
in conjunction with this technology acquisition  aps entered into a loan and security agreement with this vendor 
under this agreement  aps made three loans to the vendor and its affiliates totaling million 
in the fourth quarter  aps declared the borrower in default of all loans and seized the borrower s accounts receivable  inventory  assignment of contracted arrangements with the borrower s retailer network  and posa terminals for a value of approximately million 
aps is negotiating the sale of the collateral seized to cci  and aps expects to receive a note from cci as payment 
aps expects the sale to be completed by the end of the first quarter as part of the foreclosure  the remaining outstanding loan balance of million was restructured 
the amended and restated loan agreement matures on november  aps has established an appropriate reserve against the remaining loan balance with regard to the collectibility of the loan 
xcelecom  inc 
the principal factors affecting the financial results of xcelecom and its subsidiaries are construction spending  competition  fixed priced contract estimation and bidding  work related hazards and insurance  attracting and retaining management expertise  and risks related to management of internal growth 
additional risk factors include general economic conditions  the pace of technological changes  recoverability and potential for impairment of goodwill  and collectibility of receivables 
more than half of xcelecom s business is the installation of electrical  mechanical and integrated network information systems in newly constructed and renovated buildings and plants 
downturns in levels of construction starts can have a material adverse effect on xcelecom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  xcelecom s business is subject to seasonal variations in operations and demand that affect the construction business  particularly in new construction 
quarterly results may also be affected by regional economic conditions 
accordingly  xcelecom s performance in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year 
the specialty contracting construction services business is highly fragmented and competitive 
a majority of xcelecom s revenues are derived from projects requiring competitive bids  however  an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience  technical capability and financial strength 
xcelecom competes with national  regional and local companies  many of which are small  owner operated entities that operate in a limited geographic area 
competitive factors in the specialty contracting construction services business include the availability of qualified and or licensed personnel  reputation for integrity and quality  safety record  cost structure  relationships with customers  geographic diversity  the ability to control project costs  experience in specialized markets  the ability to obtain surety bonding  adequate working capital  and access to bank credit 
the competitive bidding process for new business contracts may also intensify during economic downturns and result in lower potential profit margins and an increased potential for project cost overruns  resulting in losses 
xcelecom believes that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under lines of credit  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  xcelecom s ability to generate positive cash flow at its historical levels in the future could be adversely impacted by numerous risks  including economic cycles  competition  cost overruns on fixed price projects  and reductions in collections 
such reductions in cash flow  together with the financial and other covenants in xcelecom s credit facility agreements  could limit its ability to borrow additional funds 
additionally  failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse affect on xcelecom 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require xcelecom to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that xcelecom will perform under the terms of a contract and that it will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if xcelecom fails to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
xcelecom must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
to date  xcelecom has not had any significant reimbursements to its surety for bond related costs  and it believes that it is unlikely that it will have to fund claims under its surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
xcelecom currently generates  and expects to continue to generate  a large proportion of its revenues under fixed price contracts 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits for a project differing from those originally estimated and could result in losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from estimated contract costs can have a significant impact on xcelecom s operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
hazards related to xcelecom s industry include  but are not limited to  electrocutions  fires  mechanical failures  and transportation accidents 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment  and may result in suspension of operations 
xcelecom s third party insurance is subject to large deductibles for which reserves are established 
accordingly  xcelecom self insures for this exposure 
xcelecom believes its insurance and provisions for self insurance of deductibles are adequate to cover all losses and liabilities 
losses impacting self insurance provisions or exceeding insurance limits could impact xcelecom s operating results 
historically  a significant amount of xcelecom s growth has come through acquisitions 
from july of to xcelecom s last significant acquisition in april of  xcelecom has made acquisitions 
xcelecom currently does not intend to grow materially through acquisitions in the foreseeable future  however  it will continually evaluate acquisition prospects to complement and expand its existing business platforms 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
each acquisition involves a number of risks 
these risks include the diversion of management s attention from existing businesses to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  possible adverse effects on operating results during the integration process  and possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the combination 
if future acquisitions do not perform as expected  xcelecom may be required to write off some or all of the value of any goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisitions 
financial results may also be impacted depending on the degree of integration of acquisitions  including the ability to achieve synergies over the network of subsidiaries 
xcelecom s revenue growth over the past several years has been generated principally through acquisitions 
without significant acquisition activity  and in the absence of economic improvement in regional markets in which it operates  xcelecom does not expect any material growth in revenues in xcelecom had a backlog as of december  of approximately million  compared with comparable backlog  including the effects of acquisitions  of approximately million as of december  united capital investments  inc 
uci s investments in the venture funds described at overview and strategy above were viewed as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return and a means of promoting local economic development 
due to the type of investments and market conditions  the value of the zero stage vi fund has decreased substantially in and the other two funds have been established more recently and are not yet fully invested 
these funds have experienced a smaller decrease in value  principally due to fund management fees and syndication costs 
the cross sound project has been opposed on environmental  safety  and economic concerns by a number of public officials and private groups who have participated actively in governmental permitting proceedings relative to the project 
in january  the connecticut siting council csc granted a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to construct the cable 
the connecticut attorney general and the city of new haven appealed the csc s decision to the connecticut superior court 
in august  the superior court upheld the csc s decision  and the connecticut attorney general has appealed the superior court s decision 
that appeal has been briefed and is pending at the connecticut supreme court 
uci management believes that the csc decision will be upheld on appeal  although there can be no assurance that it will 
the project received all necessary permits prior to the cable being installed in the spring of after installation  it was determined that several sections of the cable in new haven harbor do not currently meet the burial depths required by the permits 
the authorized depth was not achieved due to the obstruction of rock ledge  sediment and other more movable types of obstruction  such as tree stumps and metal plate debris 
the department of environmental protection dep and united states army corp of engineers have raised no environmental or navigational concerns related to operation of the cable as currently buried  however  the dep has indicated that the permit depth must be reached before commercial operation can begin 
cross sound is developing proposals for achieving the required burial depth 
however  the dep could determine that a new permitting process is required for some or all of the work 
moreover  a connecticut legislative moratorium on installing new gas and utility lines across long island sound  which is in effect until june  could impact the permitting process 
there is discussion in the connecticut legislature on extending this moratorium 
work in new haven harbor is prohibited from mid january through march and from june through september  due to concerns related to fish and shellfish 
in january  cross sound sought to modify its dep permit 
the requested modifications would change the burial depth requirement to provide that current burial is acceptable and would allow operation of the cable while cross sound works to meet the permit depth requirements 
the dep refused to consider the request  citing the legislative moratorium 
cross sound then filed in connecticut superior court a request that the court issue an order requiring the dep to consider the request for permit modification without regard to the moratorium  which cross sound asserts does not apply to the cross sound request 
the superior court heard argument in february  and a decision is expected by the end of the first quarter as of december   uci s share of the actual project cost for the cross sound cable was million 
uci provided a guarantee to hydro quebec for uci s participating share of the construction costs  and uil holdings provided a separate guarantee of uci s obligation 
the bulk of the project costs had been financed through the constructor of the project 
as of december   uci s share of the estimated total final cost of the project is million 
in december  uci provided an equity infusion of million 
in february  uci provided an additional equity infusion of million  and uil holdings loaned the project million to repay the constructor financing 
the guarantees described above were terminated when the constructor financing was repaid 
new guarantees of million  in support of hydro quebec s guarantees to third parties in connection with the construction of the project have been provided 
upon commercial operation  the uil holdings loan is expected to be refinanced with external project financing 
uci will be responsible for of any additional cost of project completion over the estimated amount 
uci has no current plans to make additional minority ownership interest investments 
united bridgeport energy  inc 
due to the relatively low wholesale price for electricity and generation capacity during the past two years  ube s investment in be has not produced the returns initially anticipated 
be projects operating income to be near breakeven 
this estimate reflects the uncertainty of energy and capacity pricing  as new market rules are instituted and further refined 
the facility is located in a transmission constrained area and may benefit from the implementation of standard market design changes in new england 
although be s projections for are expected to be near breakeven  ube is projecting a loss for  reflecting intercompany financing costs

there is opposition to the project as proposed  and it has yet to be approved by the connecticut siting council 
if the project is approved in a form different than proposed  these estimates will change accordingly 
aps has the option a call option to purchase the remaining of cci beginning in may  at a price to be determined by a formula based on future sales and earnings performance 
the other owners of cci have the option a put option to require aps to purchase such remaining  beginning in may  or earlier if certain change of control events or management changes occur 
the put and call options together provide a synthetic forward option for the purchase of the remaining of cci by aps 
the purchase price may be adjusted up or down as a result of actual performance 
xcelecom s earn out payments are payable to the former owners of certain acquired companies and are contingent on various future financial results of each company 
the actual payments may vary from these estimated amounts 
xcelecom s promissory note payments are amounts payable to the former owners of certain acquired companies 
several of the promissory notes have indemnification provisions that may cause the principal balance to change 
xcelecom s non compete payments are amounts payable to the former owners of certain acquired companies

funds from operations before dividends  capital expenditures and external financing requirements surplus are estimates based on current earnings  dividend levels and cash flow projections 
all of these estimates are subject to continual review by the uil holdings board of directors and change due to future events and conditions that may be substantially different from those used in developing the projections 
based on current cash projections  uil holdings expects that  at its quarterly reviews of the dividend  maintenance of the annual dividend of per share will be justified  absent adverse events that materially affect projected results 
the sale of ui s interests in seabrook station was completed on november  this amount represents the remaining cash income tax benefit expected to be realized in the short term borrowing balance at december  was million 
all capital requirements that exceed available cash will have to be provided by external financing 
although there is no commitment to provide such financing from any source of funds  other than a million revolving credit agreement that uil holdings has with a group of banks  a million revolving credit agreement that xcelecom has with two banks  and a million revolving credit agreement that aps has with a bank  future external financing needs are expected to be satisfied by the issuance of additional short term and long term debt 
the continued availability of these methods of financing will be dependent on many factors  including conditions in the securities markets  economic conditions  and future income and cash flow
