critical accounting policies the company believes the following are its most critical accounting policies in that they are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time services are provided and is recorded on a time and materials basis 
in most cases  the consultant is the company s employee and all costs of employing the worker are the responsibility of the company and are included in cost of revenue 
revenues generated when the company permanently places an individual with a client are recorded at the time of placement less a reserve for employees not expected to meet the probationary period 
the company  to a lesser extent  is also involved in fixed price engagements whereby revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon a variety of factors including an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
based upon the results of this analysis  the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts for this risk 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes as reported in the company s consolidated statements of income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment includes anticipating future income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
management evaluates all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the establishment and amount of a valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company s effective tax rate may vary from period to period based  for example  on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
the company has a net deferred tax asset of million as of december   which was created primarily by the impairment loss recorded as a change in accounting principle  associated with the company s adoption of sfas no 
this impairment reduced the financial statement carrying amount of goodwill  which resulted in the tax basis of tax deductible goodwill being greater than the financial statement carrying amount 
the company s tax basis in its tax deductible goodwill will be deducted in the company s income tax returns  generating million of future tax deductions over the next years  of which million will be deducted in the company is subject to periodic review by federal  state and local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business 
during  the company was notified by the internal revenue service that certain prior year income tax returns would be examined 
as part of this examination  the company recorded a tax provision of million in for a proposed adjustment with the internal revenue service 
for a further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was required to be adopted for fiscal sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations 
sfas no 
included provisions discontinuing the periodic amortization of  and requiring the assessment of the potential impairments of  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
as sfas no 
replaced the measurement guidelines for goodwill impairment  goodwill not considered impaired under previous accounting literature may be considered impaired under sfas no 
sfas no 
also required that the company complete a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step was not required 
sfas required completion of this first step within the first six months of initial adoption and annually thereafter 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step compared the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
this allocation process was only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and did not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
upon the initial adoption  any impairment loss identified was presented as a change in accounting principle  net of applicable income tax benefit  and recorded as of the beginning of that year 
subsequent to the initial adoption  any impairment loss recognized would be recorded as a charge to income from operations 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of january  during the first quarter of  the company completed both steps of the transitional goodwill impairment tests which resulted in an impairment charge of million  net of an income tax benefit of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the annual goodwill impairment tests  in which no additional impairment was recorded 
however  the company will perform goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis going forward 
if the fair value of the reporting units decrease below their respective carrying values  the company may be subject to a material charge to earnings as a result of the impairment loss that will need to be recognized 
refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
exit costs during june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized  at fair value  when the liability is incurred rather than at the time an entity commits to a plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
in in and  the company experienced a material decrease in demand for its domestic operations 
to reflect this decreased demand  the company made attempts to realign its real estate capacity needs and thus vacate and reorganize certain office space 
in the fourth quarter of  management determined that the company would not be able to utilize this vacated office space 
this determination eliminated the economic benefit associated with the vacated office space 
as a result  the company recorded million of contract termination costs  mainly due to  costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the company 
while the company looks to settle excess lease obligations  the current economic environment has made it difficult for the company to either settle or find acceptable subleasing opportunities 
the average remaining lease term for the lease obligations included herein is approximately years 
the company expects to realize million in lease savings during as a result of the charge 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
investment impairment the process of assessing whether a particular equity investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment 
the company periodically monitors an investment for impairment by considering  among other things  the investee s cash position  projected cash flows  financing needs  liquidation preference  most recent valuation data including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  the current investing environment  competition and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment 
the company had a minority investment in a privately held company that was recorded as a non current asset  and was included in other assets  net on the consolidated balance sheets 
the asset was carried at its original cost plus accrued interest 
the investment was originally made in and was set to mature in the company was notified during the third quarter of  that this privately held company was trying to raise additional capital through a recapitalization  at terms which would dilute the value of the company s investment  should a the company elect not to participate in the recapitalization and b the recapitalization be completed 
in the fourth quarter  this privately held company completed the recapitalization 
the company elected not to participate in the recapitalization  which resulted in the investment being impaired 
as a result  the company wrote off the investment in its entirety recognizing a million charge in the fourth quarter of asset impairment the company reviews its long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and identifiable intangibles would be based on the fair value of the asset 
recent accounting pronouncements during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements for both annual and interim financial statements 
the company adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
on december  but continue to account for our stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following assessment of the company s market risks does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax and credit risks 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt obligations under its credit facility and to the company s investments 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents including deposits in banks  government securities  money market funds  and short term investments with maturities  when acquired  of days or less 
the company is adverse to principal loss and seeks to preserve its invested funds by placing these funds with high credit quality issuers 
the company constantly evaluates its invested funds to respond appropriately to a reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate changes impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
the company generated approximately of its consolidated revenues for from international operations  approximately of which were from the united kingdom 
the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate has increased approximately in  from at december  to at december  the company prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the adverse impact of hypothetical changes in the british pound sterling  relative to the us dollar  on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels resulting from a change in the british pound sterling 
an additional adverse movement in the exchange rate would have had an immaterial impact on the company s cash flows and financial position for while fluctuations in the british pound sterling have not historically had a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  the lower level of earnings resulting from a decrease in demand for the services provided by the company s domestic operations have increased the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december   the company did not hold and has not previously entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
factors which may impact future results and financial condition demand for the company s services has weakened significantly and demand will likely remain weak for some time because of the current economic climate 
the company s results are affected by the level of business activity of its customers  which is driven by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve 
the current economic downturn and uncertainty has significantly hurt its results of operations 
further deterioration in global economic or political conditions could increase these effects 
as long as this uncertainty remains  management believes that the demand for the company s services will remained diminished 
therefore  management cannot predict when the demand for the company s services will significantly improve 
when the market does improve  management cannot predict  whether and to what extent  the demand for the company s services will improve 
although the company has implemented a largely variable cost model  as it relates to compensation for a substantial part of its business  further declines in revenue will have a material adverse impact on its results 
the company may also be adversely affected by consolidations through mergers and otherwise of major customers or between major customers with non customers 
these consolidations as well as corporate downsizings may result in redundant functions or services and a resulting reduction in demand by such customers for the company s services 
also  spending for outsourced business services may be put on hold until the consolidations are completed 
our market is highly competitive and the company may not be able to continue to compete efficiently 
the company s industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  with few barriers to entry by potential competitors 
the company faces significant competition in the markets that it serves and will face significant competition in any geographic market that it may enter 
in each market in which the company operates  it competes for both clients and qualified professionals with other firms offering similar services 
the company has increasingly competed against services providers offering their services from remote locations  particularly from offshore locations such as india 
the substantially lower cost of the labor pool in these remote locations puts significant pricing pressure on the company s service offerings when it competes with these service providers 
while the company believes that its service delivery model provides a superior level of service than many of these offshore based competitors  the increased pricing pressure from these providers may have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment and higher wage costs  which puts pressure on gross margins 
the company may also be adversely effected by the consolidation of vendor lists 
as customers have consolidated their number of vendors  the company historically has a high percentage of wins in that it has remained on these shortened lists of approved vendors 
competition to be an approved vendor has only intensified and if the company fails to maintain its percentage of wins for these consolidated vendor lists  its failure will have a material impact on the company s results 
the company s business may suffer from the loss of key personnel the company s operations are dependent on the continued efforts of its officers and executive management 
in addition  it is dependent on the performance and productivity of its local managers and field personnel 
the company s ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered 
the loss of those key officers and members of executive management may cause a significant disruption to our business 
moreover  the loss of its key managers and field personnel may jeopardize existing client relationships with businesses that continue to use the company s services based upon past relationships with these local managers and field personnel 
the loss of such key personnel could materially adversely affect the company s operations  including its ability to establish and maintain client relationships 
possible changes in governmental regulations could have a material impact on the company s business from time to time  legislation is proposed in the united states congress  state legislative bodies  and the foreign governments of the united kingdom and continental europe  that would have the effect of requiring employers to provide the same or similar employee benefits to consultants and other temporary personnel as those provided to full time employees 
the enactment of such legislation would eliminate one of the key economic reasons for outsourcing certain business resources and could significantly adversely impact the company s staff augmentation business 
in addition  the company s costs could increase as a result of future laws or regulations that address insurance  benefits or other employment related matters 
there can be no assurance that the company could successfully pass any such increased costs to its clients 
irs adjustments during periodic income tax audits may have a material impact on the company s results the company is subject to periodic review by federal  state  and local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business 
during  the company was notified by the internal revenue service that certain prior year income tax returns will be examined 
as part of this examination  the net tax benefit associated with an investment in a subsidiary that the company recognized in of million is also being reviewed 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an million charge for a proposed adjustment related to its ongoing audit of prior years tax returns 
while management has not received notice of any additional proposed adjustments relating to its ongoing audit of prior years tax returns  there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service will not propose additional adjustments 
additional adjustments may affect the company s financial condition and financial covenants of the company s credit facility 
the price of the company s common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors the market price for mps s common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the year ended december   the prices of its common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange ranged from a high of to a low of 
its stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including factors listed in the above risk factors and others  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in the company s quarterly operating results  announcement of new services by the company or its competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  and changes in general economic conditions 
because of this volatility  the company may fail to meet the expectations of its shareholders or of securities analysts  and its stock price could decline as a result
