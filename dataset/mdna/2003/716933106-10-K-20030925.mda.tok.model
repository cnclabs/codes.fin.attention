item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  this is a forward looking statement and is subject to risks and uncertainties 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress of our research and development programs  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our products and establish new licensing arrangements 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive to existing stockholders or subject us to restrictive covenants 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources  such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
risks related to our industry we face rapid technological change and intense competition the pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
developments by others may render our products under development or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete  or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors 
technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase 
many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do  as well as substantially more marketing  manufacturing  financial and managerial resources 
these entities represent significant competition for us 
acquisitions of  or investments in  competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors financial  marketing  manufacturing and other resources 
we are a relatively new enterprise and are engaged in the development of novel therapeutic technologies 
as a result  our resources are limited and we may experience technical challenges inherent in such novel technologies 
competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects than our products 
our competitors may develop products that are safer  more effective or less costly than our products and  therefore  present a serious competitive threat to our product offerings 
the widespread acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our products even if commercialized 
the diseases for which we are developing our therapeutic products can also be treated  in the case of cancer  by surgery  radiation and chemotherapy  and in the case of atherosclerosis  by surgery  angioplasty  drug therapy and the use of devices to maintain and open blood vessels 
these treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
the established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our products to receive widespread acceptance if commercialized 
the price of our common stock may be volatile the market prices for securities of small capitalization biotechnology companies  including ours  have historically been highly volatile 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors  including the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us or our competitors  technological innovations or new therapeutic products  governmental regulation  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  litigation  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others  comments by securities analysts  and general market conditions in our industry 
in addition  if any of the risks described in these risk factors actually occurred  it could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reimbursement and reform the continuing efforts of government and insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability  and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers  suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
while we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are obtained from governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as hmos 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
our business exposes us to product liability claims the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of our products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us 
although we are insured against such risks in connection with clinical trials and commercial sales of our products  our present product liability insurance may be inadequate 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms 
in addition  product liability coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost 
an inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our pharmaceutical products 
a product liability claim or recall would have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business involves environmental risks in connection with our research and development activities and our manufacture of materials and products  we are subject to federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials  biological specimens and wastes 
although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws  regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an occurrence  we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources

actual results could differ materially from any future performance suggested in this report as a result of the factors  including those discussed in risk factors  elsewhere in this report 
overview pharmacyclics is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of products that improve existing therapeutic approaches to cancer and atherosclerosis 
to date we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of our products and have not derived any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we have two primary drug products  or research and development programs  for which we are currently focusing our efforts xcytrin and antrin 
we have begun enrollment in a pivotal phase trial of xcytrin for the potential treatment of lung cancer patients with brain metastases 
this randomized controlled study  known as the smart study of neurologic progression with motexafin gadolinium and radiation therapy trial  will enroll about patients  and we plan to complete enrollment in this trial in the fourth quarter of calendar the trial will compare the effects of whole brain radiation therapy wbrt alone to wbrt plus xcytrin in lung cancer patients with brain metastases 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be time to neurologic progression as determined by a blinded events review committee 
survival and neurocognitive function will also be assessed as secondary endpoints of the trial 
we requested and received a special protocol assessment from the fda for the smart trial 
special protocol assessment provides for sponsors of clinical trials to receive official fda evaluation  guidance and agreement on pivotal trials that will form the basis for final approval 
the smart trial is based on the results of our completed large randomized trial in patients with brain metastases from solid tumors 
that trial enrolled patients and compared wbrt alone to wbrt plus xcytrin 
the primary end points were survival and time to neurologic progression 
the overall trial did not meet its end points  but a benefit was seen in lung cancer  the largest sub group of patients n 
there was an improvement in time to neurologic progression as assessed by investigators and by a blinded events review committee for lung cancer patients receiving xcytrin 
lung cancer patients treated with xcytrin were also found to have a reduction in death due to brain tumor progression as assessed by investigators and had improved time to neurocognitive progression 
we have completed patient enrollment in a multicenter phase trial with xcytrin for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme  a malignant primary brain tumor 
we have begun phase clinical trials with xcytrin used alone in hematologic cancers such as lymphoma 
phase trials are underway evaluating xcytrin given in combination with doxorubicin and with docetaxel taxotere for lung  prostate  ovarian and breast cancer and combined with radiation and chemotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed  advanced head and neck cancer patients 
through our cooperative research and development agreement  the national cancer institute is conducting phase trials of xcytrin for treatment of both primary adult and pediatric brain tumors  pancreatic cancer and lung cancer 
we also completed a phase clinical trial with antrin phototherapy for the treatment of coronary artery disease in patients receiving balloon angioplasty and stents 
this study was primarily designed to evaluate the safety of various doses of drug and light 
results of this trial were published in the september issue of the journal circulation 
patients were treated on this protocol  which demonstrated the safety and feasibility of antrin phototherapy and determined optimum doses of drug and light for future trials 
no major treatment related angiographic or biochemical adverse effects or abnormalities were observed and no dose limiting toxicities were noted 
no instances of emergency coronary artery bypass  death  stroke or myocardial infarction occurred in patients who received both antrin infusion and endovascular illumination and activation of the drug 
the most frequently reported side effects were mild  transient rash and reversible mild tingling in the hands and feet  some of which lasted days to weeks  but did not require clinical intervention 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  and as of june   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products generates sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our products under development  and obtain required regulatory clearances and successfully manufacture and market our products 
see risk factors all of our product candidates are in development  and we cannot be certain that any of our products under development will be commercialized  acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain  and failure to achieve market acceptance will harm our business  we have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to have losses in the future  failure to obtain product approvals or comply with ongoing governmental regulations could adversely affect our business and our capital requirements are uncertain and we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future 
results of operations comparison of years ended june   and revenues 
we had no revenues for the years ended june  and  and revenues of  for the year ended june  revenues for the year ended june  resulted primarily from a non recurring fee paid by nycomed to terminate their collaboration agreement to sell and market a photodynamic therapy cancer product outside the united states  canada and japan and contract revenue received from nycomed prior to the termination of the agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the  decrease from to was primarily due to a reduction in headcount  the timing of clinical trial expenses related to our xcytrin program and continued reduced spending on our antrin program 
the  decrease from to was primarily due to decreased expenses with our antrin program 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and device development and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
prior to  we did not track our historical research and development costs by specific program 
for this reason we cannot accurately estimate our total historical costs on a specific program basis 
direct costs by program and indirect costs are as follows program direct costs xcytrin    antrin    other    total direct costs    indirect costs    total research and development costs    xcytrin xcytrin direct costs were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower employee costs  as we reduced headcount in the second half of fiscal  lower drug manufacturing costs  due to the timing of the manufacturing of xcytrin  and lower consulting expenses 
it is our policy to expense all costs related to the manufacture of our drug products when incurred until commercial viability of such products have been demonstrated and the necessary regulatory approvals have been received the decrease of  in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower clinical trial costs  as our phase trial was completed in fiscal and lower drug manufacturing costs  due to the timing of the manufacturing of xcytrin 
these decreases were partially offset by the increase in employee costs  as we increased staffing to support the regulatory filings related to our initial phase clinical trial of xcytrin 
antrin antrin direct costs were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to us continuing the trend of focusing our resources on our xcytrin product 
fiscal efforts were focused on completing the clinical trials that were in process at the end of fiscal these efforts resulted in lower clinical trial costs  lower employee and travel costs  and lower consulting costs 
the decrease of  in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to focusing our resources on our xcytrin product 
this resulted in lower pre clinical studies costs  lower employee costs  and lower device expenditures 
antrin direct costs in fiscal were also affected by lower drug manufacturing costs other other direct costs were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decreases in other direct costs year over year were primarily the result of decreased work on the company s photodynamic therapy cancer product 
indirect costs indirect costs were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease of  in fiscal as compared to was primarily due to reduced employee costs  due to a reduction in headcount in fiscal and reduced facility costs  as the company renegotiated one of its building leases to reduce the amount of leased space and the cost to lease the remaining space 
the increase of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in facility and it support costs  to support the growth in personnel and higher employee costs  as we increased headcount to support our research and development efforts  partially offset by lower consulting costs 
we expect slightly higher research and development costs in as compared to the higher costs will be primarily due to higher costs from our phase smart trial and due to additional phase trials for our xcytrin product 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the years ended june   and were   and  respectively 
the  decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in marketing and market research expenses  as the company reduced such costs to focus resources on its phase clinical trial  lower employee costs  as the company reduced its headcount in fiscal  and a reduction in consulting expenses  as the company utilized internal resources 
the  increase in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from higher personnel costs  and higher facilities and it support costs  to support expected increases in operations 
we expect fiscal marketing  general and administrative spending to remain consistent with levels 
interest and other  net 
interest and other  net  was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decreases in each of the past two fiscal years were primarily due to lower interest rates being earned on reduced balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of fixed rate instruments 
income taxes 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and the benefit from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than  as defined  over a three year period 
such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
a full valuation allowance has been established for the company s deferred tax assets since realization of such assets through the generation of future taxable income is uncertain 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital have been private and public equity financings and proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as interest income 
since inception  we have used approximately  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash used by investing activities of  in the year ended june  consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities of  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively  consisted primarily of proceeds of maturities and sales of marketable securities  net of purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities of   and  in the years ended june    and  respectively  consisted primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the company leases its facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire in fiscal future minimum lease payments and sublease income under non cancelable operating leases as of june  are as follows operating operating lease sublease commitments income fiscal   fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  total minimum lease payments and operating lease income   based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least fiscal year as discussed above under item business cancer therapy with xcytrin  we expect to complete enrollment of our phase clinical trial of our first investigational drug xcytrin in patients with brain metastases from non small cell lung cancer in the fourth calendar quarter of the second fiscal quarter of our fiscal 
there can be no assurance that our current capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our capital needs through full enrollment of the xcytrin trial or  if xcytrin is ultimately approved for sale  through its production  marketing and commercialization 
if our existing capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements through testing  regulatory clearance and commercialization of xcytrin  we would be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships partnerships with other drug manufacturers or other arrangements to complete commercialization 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of product development  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors risks related to pharmacyclics our capital requirements are uncertain and we may have difficulty raising capital in the future 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined by the sec as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
license and milestone fees are recognized as revenue when earned over the period of the arrangement  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of any on going obligation 
license  milestone  contract and grant revenues are not subject to repayment 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at june   these investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the following factors length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  our intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and to date we have had no declines in fair value that have been identified as other than temporary 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provision of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
the company does not expect that this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  would have potentially declined by
