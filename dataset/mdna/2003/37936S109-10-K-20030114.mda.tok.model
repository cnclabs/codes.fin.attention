critical accounting policies this management discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared using certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty 
while we believe that these accounting policies  and management s judgments and estimates  are reasonable  actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from management s current judgments and estimates 
we believe that the accounting policies and related matters described in the paragraphs below are those that depend most heavily on management s judgments and estimates 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or net realizable value 
the company analyzes the net realizable value of its inventory on an ongoing basis 
in determining whether the net realizable value of its inventory is impaired  the company considers historical sales performance and expected future product sales  market conditions in which the company distributes its products  changes in product strategy and the potential for the introduction of new technology or products by the company and its competitors 
these items  as well as the introduction of new technology on products  could result in future inventory obsolescence 
software capitalization costs based upon achieving technological feasibility through a detailed program design for argus tm and aurora products  the company has capitalized the cost of software coding and development of these products  and reflects the amortization of these costs in cost of sales 
the annual amortization is calculated using the greater of a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
the estimation of both future sales of products as well as the life of the product are critical estimates that are affected by both internal and external factors that might affect the company s estimates 
if the useful life is reduced  or sales projections fall short of the estimation  amortization expense will increase 
prior to fiscal the company recorded these costs in inventory 
the company has reclassified prior year balances in this annual report 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to its customers and the passage of title  including shipments to its unconsolidated affiliates  or at the time services are completed with respect to repairs not covered by warranty agreements 
with respect to sales to its unconsolidated affiliates  the company defers its pro rata share of gross profit on those sales until such time as its affiliates sell to a third party customer 
the timing of sales to affiliates can have an effect on the company s recognized profitability 
warranty policy the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time related sales revenue is recognized 
furthermore  the company warrants that its products are free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year  or almost two years relating to its argus and aurora products  from the date of initial purchase 
the warranty does not cover any losses or damage that occur as a result of improper installation  misuse or neglect and repair or modification by anyone other than the company and its appointed service centers 
repair costs beyond the warranty period are charged to the company s customers 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable at september   our accounts receivable balance was million 
our accounting policy is to reserve for the accounts receivable of specific customers based on our assessment of certain customers financial condition 
we make these assessments using our knowledge of the industry coupled with current circumstances or known events and our past experiences 
this policy is based on our past collection experience 
to the extent that our experience changes or our customers experience financial difficulty our reserve may need to increase

the company s share of these affiliates earnings or losses is included in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company eliminates its pro rata share of gross profit on sales to its affiliates for inventory on hand at the affiliates at the end of the year 
for investments in which no public market exists  the company reviews the operating performance  financing and forecasts for such entities in assessing the net realizable values of these investments

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires that long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
the company reviews its long lived assets  at least annually  for indicators of impairment or actual impairment events 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach for financial reporting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes at the enacted rates at which these differences are expected to reverse 
the effective tax rate for the company is affected by the income mix derived from the core business and from its share of income from foreign affiliates that may have different tax rates 
realizability of deferred tax assets are dependent upon the company s future profitability 
to the extent the company experiences continued losses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets may be impaired 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fiscal saw continued moderation in the level of inflation 
in order to offset the resultant rise in the costs of operations  the company has assessed  and will continue to assess  ways to gain efficiencies and reduce operating and manufacturing costs  thereby increasing profit margins and improving its operations 
while the company operates in many international markets  it does so principally through the sale of its products with invoices denominated in the united states currency 
additionally  the company operates without the use of derivative or hedging instruments 
the company is subject to the effects caused by the strengthening or weakening of the united states currency  and as such may consider the use of currency instruments in the future

as such  the interest rate is variable and the interest expense on potential borrowings is based upon the types of loans and applicable interest rates at the time of borrowing 
in the event the company had its entire revolving credit facility  million  outstanding for the entire year  each basis point increase would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately  the company has investments in privately held unconsolidated foreign companies for the purposes of conducting its business overseas and attaining its strategic objectives 
these investments have a net carrying value of million and million at september  and  respectively 
these investments are included in investments in unconsolidated affiliates and are accounted for using the equity method 
for investments in which no public market exists  our policy is to regularly review the operating performance  recent financing transactions and forecasts for such companies in assessing the net realizable values of the investments in these companies 
impairment losses on equity investments are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded  in impairment losses during the fourth quarter of fiscal
