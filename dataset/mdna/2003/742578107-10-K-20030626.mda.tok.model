item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition on form k should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements of printronix in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available to us at the time 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities for the fiscal year periods presented 
we continuously evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  customer programs and incentives  doubtful accounts  inventories  warranty obligations  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the most critical accounting policies used to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements are the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when it is realized or realizable and earned  which is generally at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement in the form of a contract or a purchase order  the product has been shipped  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our sales are based upon written contractual agreements with our resellers that include established pricing and terms 
customers may return products that are incompatible with the intended application 
we continuously monitor such product returns and  at the time of sale  record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based upon historical experience  notification we receive of 
table of contents significant pending returns and any other known factors 
although such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting returns could have a materially adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 
we record estimated revenue reductions at the time of sale for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing  rebates  or other programs 
future market conditions may cause us to increase the amount of incentive programs or other programs and could result in additional revenue reductions at that time 
we offer professional services  such as training and customized applications to customers 
these services are generally short term in duration and are billed separately upon completion and acceptance of the service 
although the revenue received from professional services is not currently material  professional services are considered an area of potential growth 
we record revenue for shipping costs charged to customers 
the related shipping costs incurred are recorded in cost of sales 
we offer printer maintenance services through service agreements that customers may purchase separately from the printer 
these agreements are mostly for a one year period 
we provide the point of customer contact and initial diagnostic services  and supply the parts used for printer repairs 
we have contracted with third parties to perform the on site repair services 
during fiscal years  and during the second quarter of fiscal year  revenue from maintenance contracts was deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of each individual contract  which approximates the manner in which costs are incurred 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we acquired a portfolio of domestic third party maintenance contracts and assumed the responsibility for servicing those contracts 
upon the purchase of those contracts  we provided the point of customer contact and initial diagnostic services  and supplied the parts used for printer repairs 
we contracted with third parties to perform the on site repair services 
revenue from the purchased maintenance contracts was deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contracts 
prior to the purchase of this portfolio of maintenance contracts  we generated revenue on maintenance contracts through the sale of the service obligation to a third party provider 
the third party provider was responsible for providing all repair parts and for the performance of all on site maintenance services for the contract period 
the revenue on such contracts was recognized fully in the period the contract was sold to the third party provider because we assumed no further material obligation after the date of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  the general economic conditions and any specific customer collection issues we have identified 
although such bad debt losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same bad debt loss rates that we have in the past 
because our accounts receivable include substantial receivables from a few large resellers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these resellers could result in additional allowances that could have a materially adverse effect upon our future operating results and financial condition 
inventories we record a provision to value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory  or the current estimated market value of the inventory  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we also perform regular reviews 
table of contents of our inventory and record a provision for estimated excess and obsolete items based upon forecasted demand  and any other known factors at the time 
estimated future demand could prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may experience product shortages  or may only be able to obtain the necessary components at a higher cost 
conversely  an inaccurate estimate of future demand may also result in additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories 
unanticipated changes in demand or changes in technology could have a significant impact upon our results of operations and our financial condition 
research and development costs our internal research and development costs  which include software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
under our current development methods and procedures  the technological feasibility of the software being developed is not established until substantially all of the product development costs have been incurred 
as a result  we have not capitalized any software development costs for software that is embedded in our products  because the costs incurred after attaining technological feasibility are not material 
warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers  depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
printronix offers either a day on site or a month return to factory standard parts and labor warranty on printer and verifier products to most customers 
defective printers and verifiers can be returned to us for repairs or replacement in the applicable warranty period at no cost to the customer 
supplies are warranted for the shelf life of the products  which can be up to two years 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
we engage in product quality programs and processes  including evaluating our suppliers 
although our warranty costs historically have been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in product return rates  or a significant increase in the cost to repair our products  could have a materially adverse impact upon our operating results and financial condition 
long lived assets we assess the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an underlying asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would record an adjustment to the carrying value of the assets affected based upon a discounted cash flow method 
any major unanticipated change in circumstances could have a significant impact upon the recoverability of long lived assets and upon our operating results and financial condition 
all goodwill and most intangible assets were fully amortized as of march   and the remaining intangible asset related to unpatented technology was fully amortized as of march  income taxes we estimate our income tax liability based upon current tax laws in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and those recognized for tax purposes 
we periodically review our deferred tax assets for realization based upon historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
we also record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when management believes that deferred tax assets more likely than not will not be realized 
if the provision for income tax is inadequate  or if we are unable to realize deferred tax assets  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  we could experience income tax charges in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are 
table of contents in excess of those eventually needed  or if we are able to realize additional deferred tax assets  or if tax laws change favorably  we could experience reduced income tax charges 
we have operations in multiple international taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues 
while we believe we have made adequate provision for any such issues  an unfavorable resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations overview of fiscal year compared with fiscal year reported improved profitability on lower revenue 
we attribute the revenue decrease partially to the continuing softness in the worldwide economy and the related reduced capital spending and partially to the impact of competing technologies on line matrix printer sales 
printronix printers are used in manufacturing  supply chain logistics and business critical applications and have a long life  which allows users to delay programs to upgrade these printers in times of economic uncertainty 
gross margins improved as a result of a stronger euro and continuing cost reduction programs 
cost control programs maintained relatively flat engineering and general and administrative spending  while continued emphasis on sales and marketing programs  including the major accounts and vertical marketing programs  resulted in higher spending in that area 
overall profitability also improved as a result of higher foreign currency exchange gains as the euro strengthened and also as a result of lower interest expense due to lower interest rates 
cash balances increased by million and inventory decreased by million as a result of asset management programs 
our focus during the fiscal year was on the programs initiated in fiscal year to expand our range of printing solutions in the retail logistics and automotive vertical markets 
also  we continued our emphasis on growth opportunities in the asia pacific region by expanding into korea and by specifically targeting the banking industry in china  where sales were up over the prior year 
we also continued to grow our thermal printer sales  which were up over the prior year  and to expand our major accounts marketing 
we continue to take action to improve our profitability but have noted that revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year are trailing behind the prior quarter revenue of million by approximately five to percent 
despite the cost reduction programs  if revenue for the quarter is at the low end of the range of estimates  the company could record a net loss for the first quarter of fiscal year overview of fiscal year compared with fiscal year reported improved profitability on lower revenue 
we attribute the revenue decrease partially to softness in the worldwide economy and reduced capital spending and partially to the impact of competing technologies on line matrix printer sales 
despite lower revenue  we returned to profitability due to several factors  including the improved gross margins resulting from the restructuring efforts initiated and completed in the latter part of fiscal year  certain price increases and a continuing product cost reduction program 
cash balances increased by million and inventory decreased by million 
our focus during the year was to develop future revenue opportunities by expanding the major accounts marketing program and by expanding customer services 
we began programs to pursue total printing solutions in the retail logistics and automotive vertical markets 
net sales fiscal year compared with revenue for the fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with the prior fiscal year 
we attribute the decrease partially to continued softness in the worldwide economy and the continued slowdown in capital spending for plant expansion or refurbishment and partially to the impact of competing technologies on line matrix printer sales 
the decrease in sales was principally due to lower line matrix sales in the americas 
we also were impacted by lower sales to our major customer 
thermal printer sales increased over the prior fiscal year  due to our major accounts and vertical marketing programs 

table of contents americas sales were million  down million  or  from a year ago 
americas oem sales decreased to million  principally as a result of lower sales to our largest customer 
americas distribution sales decreased to million 
increased sales in the retail logistics market as a result of our direct marketing were more than offset by lower sales elsewhere 
americas direct sales increased to million 
emea sales were unchanged from the prior year at million 
emea oem sales decreased million  or  to million  principally as a result of lower sales to our largest customer 
emea distribution sales were million  up from million a year ago  due to our direct marketing programs 
emea direct sales were million  up from million a year ago 
asia pacific sales increased million  or  from a year ago to million  mostly as a result of increased line matrix sales through the distribution channel into the banking industry in china  where sales were up over the prior year 
line matrix sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from the prior fiscal year 
line matrix revenue was of revenue versus in the prior fiscal year 
laser sales totaled million  down from the prior fiscal year 
laser sales were of revenue compared with in the prior fiscal year 
thermal sales were million  up from the prior fiscal year 
thermal sales were of revenue compared with in the prior fiscal year 
verification products were million  a decrease of million from the prior fiscal year 
verification product sales were of revenue  essentially unchanged from the prior fiscal year 
sales of recurring items such as spares  consumables and customer services  included in the product line sales discussed above  were million  down from the prior fiscal year 
sales to our largest customer  ibm  represented of net sales for the fiscal year  compared with a year ago 
sales to the second largest customer represented of net sales for the fiscal year  compared with a year ago 
sales to the top customers represented and of net sales for the current and prior fiscal year  respectively 
sales by channel were oem  distribution and direct compared with oem  distribution and direct for the prior fiscal year 
revenue from united states customers was and of total revenue  while revenue from international customers was and of total revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
net sales fiscal year compared with revenue for the fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with the prior fiscal year 
we attribute the decrease partially to softness in the worldwide economy and the continued slowdown in capital spending for plant expansion or refurbishment and partially to the impact of competing technologies on line matrix printers sales 
the decrease in sales was principally in the americas 
lower sales were noted across all product lines  but mainly in line matrix products 
we also were impacted by lower sales to our major customer 
americas sales were million  down million  or  from a year ago 
americas oem sales decreased to million 
lower sales to some of printronix s larger oem customers were only partially offset by higher sales to some of the smaller oems 
americas distribution sales decreased to million 
americas direct sales increased to million 
emea sales decreased million  or  to million 
emea oem sales were unchanged from the prior year at million 
emea distribution sales were million  up from million a year ago 
emea direct sales were million  down from million a year ago 
asia pacific sales increased million  or  from a year ago to million  mostly as a result of increased line matrix sales into india and china 
line matrix sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from the prior fiscal year 
line matrix revenue was of revenue versus in the prior fiscal year 
laser sales totaled million  down from the prior fiscal year 
laser sales were of revenue compared with in the prior fiscal year

sales of recurring items such as spares  consumables and customer services  included in the product line sales discussed above  were million  down from the prior fiscal year 
sales to our largest customer  ibm  represented of net sales for the fiscal year  compared with a year ago 
sales to the second largest customer represented of net sales for the fiscal year  compared with a year ago 
sales to the top customers represented and of net sales for the current and prior fiscal year  respectively 
sales by channel were oem  distribution and direct compared with oem  distribution and direct for the prior fiscal year 
revenue from united states customers was and of total revenue  while revenue from international customers was and of total revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year compared with and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal year is primarily due to the strength of the euro and continuing cost reductions 
the increase in gross margin percentage during fiscal year is due to a full year of benefits of the manufacturing restructuring activities which were completed in late fiscal year  together with continuing cost reductions  certain price increases  and a more favorable product mix 
operating expenses operating expenses  excluding restructuring charges  consist of engineering and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative costs 
operating expenses  excluding restructuring charges  were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe it is critical to continue to invest in research and development to ensure technology leadership in line matrix and thermal printing solutions 
engineering expenses consist mostly of labor and test materials 
in fiscal year  we spent million on engineering and development  compared with million in fiscal year and million for fiscal year in fiscal year  expenditures were made to bring to market a wireless feature option for the thermal and line matrix printers 
in addition  expenditures were made to develop a lpm line matrix printer  the pd  and to develop the ps  a lpm line matrix printer which uses a single hammer bank instead of a double hammer bank 
the pd is the world s fastest line matrix printer  printing lines per minute using a double hammer bank 
in fiscal years and  expenditures were made to enhance the line matrix product family with a faster printer  resulting in the introduction of the p during fiscal year we also enhanced our market leading printer management networking solutions with printnet enterprise and odv verification solutions 
the decrease in fiscal year compared with fiscal year was due to lower development costs as both the t product line and p line matrix printer moved into production 
as a percentage of sales  engineering and development expenses increased slightly in fiscal year  due to lower revenue  to from in fiscal year and in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year increased to million  compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to from in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses in all fiscal years presented is due to higher labor and marketing costs due to increased resources being applied to the major accounts and vertical marketing programs 
general and administrative spending for fiscal year was million in fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year from the prior fiscal year due to lower labor costs  lower provision for doubtful accounts and lower amortization of intangibles 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year over the prior fiscal year due to higher property taxes  higher labor costs  increased provision for doubtful accounts  higher legal fees  and higher utility costs associated with the california energy shortage 

table of contents as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year restructuring charges information on restructuring charges incurred in fiscal year can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this annual report on form k 
foreign currency  net foreign currency transactions and remeasurements were gains of million in fiscal year compared with losses of million in fiscal year and gains of million in fiscal year fiscal year foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains were primarily due to a strengthened euro 
the foreign currency losses in fiscal year were primarily due to a weakened euro 
the future effect of changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies upon our results of operations or financial condition is difficult to predict 
a summary of the effects of the changes in the value of the euro can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this annual report on form k 
interest and other expenses  net interest and other expenses  net  decreased and million  respectively  in fiscal years and the decreases were due to lower interest expense as a result of reduced interest rates  partially offset by lower interest income 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal year and fiscal year was and  respectively  primarily as a result of domestic operating losses due to the revenue declines in the americas and pre tax earnings by subsidiaries that operate within lower tax jurisdictions 
we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year to be between and 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was a benefit of  primarily as a result of domestic operating losses and pre tax earnings by subsidiaries that operate within lower tax jurisdictions 
we have a favorable pioneer tax status in singapore for income generated from the manufacture of the printronix p series line matrix products 
the pioneer status started in april  lasts for five years  and automatically is extendible to eight years 
the pioneer status mandates that we meet certain requirements  including meeting specific levels of capital investment and engineering headcount 
earnings generated there are exempt from tax liability through the exemption is automatically extended to the pioneer status reduced foreign taxes by million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the diluted net income per share effect of this pioneer status was cents  cents and cents for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the provision for taxes included certain state and foreign taxes for all fiscal years presented 
liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity historically has been cash generated from operations 
on may   we obtained a credit facility with a united states bank for million that consisted of a million  seven year note secured by our irvine facility and a million three year unsecured line of credit 
we repaid the line of credit borrowings as scheduled in the first quarter of fiscal year  and  on june   cancelled our million unsecured line of credit see note on page of this annual report on form k 

table of contents fiscal year compared with cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in fiscal year  principally due to increased profitability and a reduction in inventory levels 
we generated million in cash from operations  which was lower than the million generated from operations a year ago 
the decrease in the cash generated from operations compared with a year ago is the result of a slowing in the rate of decrease in inventory and an increase in accounts receivables 
investment in property  plant and equipment continued to be less than depreciation expense 
the remaining major uses of cash were payments totaling million made on the seven year note and repurchases of stock totaling million 
we ended fiscal year with debt of million related to the seven year note  which consisted of million long term and million for the current portion of the long term debt 
the remaining shares that could be repurchased at the discretion of management under the stock buyback program totaled  shares as of march  we believe our internally generated funds are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
should we experience the need to obtain additional sources of funds  we believe we could obtain such funds through additional credit facilities 
fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents increased to million from million in fiscal year primarily due to a return to profitability  reductions in inventory  lower accounts receivable  and reduced capital expenditures 
we generated million in cash provided by operations during the fiscal year  compared with a use of cash of million in the prior fiscal year 
accounts receivable decreased due to lower sales 
inventory levels decreased as a result of completing the manufacturing restructuring wherein certain manufacturing processes were consolidated into the singapore facilities  which had resulted in carrying more inventory during the transition  and also due to other manufacturing asset management programs 
investment in property  plant and equipment was less than depreciation expense as we completed our major product development efforts 
the remaining major uses of cash were payments on the line of credit totaling million and payments of million made on the seven year note 
we ended fiscal year with debt of million related to the seven year note  which consisted of million long term and million for the current portion of the long term debt 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated under certain borrowing and lease commitments 
additional information on our obligations can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page and in note on page the minimum payments due as of march   for the subsequent fiscal years  are as follows payments due thereafter total in thousands contractual obligations operating leases see note long term debt see note total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents we also are obligated under certain unsecured lines of credit and a credit agreement which support our hedging activities for our foreign subsidiaries 
no amounts have been borrowed against these lines of credit or credit agreement as of march   or for the fiscal periods presented 
the commitment amounts and expiration periods  as of march   are summarized below see note

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually and prohibits periodic amortization of goodwill and some intangible assets into income 
we adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect upon our financial position or results of operations 
all goodwill was fully amortized into income in the normal course of business by the end of fiscal year our review of the intangible assets resulted in no noted impairment and all intangible assets were fully amortized into income by the end of fiscal year see note on page of this annual report on form k for information on the required disclosures

sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and requires that a liability for an exit cost be recognized when incurred 
this statement also requires that the initial measurement of this liability be at fair value 
should we have a restructuring activity in the future  this statement would primarily impact the timing of the recognition of the expense 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no

factors that may affect financial results and financial condition any of the following risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business  financial results or financial condition 
other risks and uncertainties also could affect our business 
any of these factors could cause the actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements in this document 
although we reassess material trends and uncertainties affecting our results of operations and financial condition in connection with the preparation of our quarterly and annual reports  we do not intend to review or revise  in light of future events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this document 
the information contained below should be carefully considered when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this document 
we operate in an industry characterized by technological change 
the printing solutions industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by technological change  frequent new product development  periodic product obsolescence  evolving industry standards  changing information technologies and evolving distribution channels 
we must adapt quickly to changing technological  application and solutions needs  and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
we could incur substantial cost to keep pace with the technological changes  and may not be able to adapt to these changes 
although we believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to these characteristics  this may change in the future 
our future success largely depends upon our ability to continuously develop new products  services and solutions 
to develop new products  we invest in research and development 
in spite of our efforts  we may fail to develop new products 
additionally  the new products we develop may not achieve market acceptance or may not be manufactured at competitive costs or in sufficient volumes 
we cannot guarantee the success of our research and development efforts 
our failure to enhance our existing products  services and solutions or to develop and introduce new products  services and solutions that meet changing customer requirements and evolving technological standards would adversely impact our ability to sell our products 
we operate in a highly competitive market 
the market for medium and high speed computer printers and the related post sale supplies is highly competitive and subject to change 
we compete directly with several companies of various sizes  including some of the largest businesses in the united states and japan 
our competitors include privately held companies  publicly held companies and subsidiaries of multinational corporations 
some of our competitors may enter into strategic business relationships with other companies 
our current main competitors in line matrix printers are tally and genicom 
our current main competitors in thermal printers are zebra technologies corporation nasdaq zbra  tokyo electric 
table of contents company tec  sato  and intermec nyse una 
we cannot offer assurance that we can successfully compete against these current competitors or future competitors 
some competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  sales  marketing and other resources than we do and have achieved greater name recognition for their products and technologies than we have 
we may not be able to successfully increase our market penetration or our overall share of the printer market 
we can offer no assurance that products with superior market acceptance  superior price or superior performance will not be introduced by our competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins  loss of market share and could require increased investment in inventory  research and development  sales expenses  marketing programs and expenditures to expand distribution channels 
if we fail to address our competitive challenges  there could be a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we sell a large portion of our products to a small number of resellers oems and distributors and we expect that this will continue 
we rely upon a few resellers for a significant amount of our revenue 
in fiscal year  sales to our largest and second largest resellers represented and of net sales  respectively 
sales to the top ten customers represented of net sales 
the loss of any one of these resellers would have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our sales channels 
we believe that our future success depends upon our ability to provide industrial strength printing solutions to a broader customer base and to maintain good relationships with our major oems and distributors 
we believe that continued purchase of our products by oems is dependent upon many factors  including oems desire to use outside suppliers rather than investing the capital resources necessary to develop their own products 
our dependence upon a small number of major resellers exposes us to numerous risks  including loss of channel  customers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing  payment and product delivery schedules  and direct competition should a customer decide to manufacture printers internally 
we cannot guarantee that a major reseller will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in an environment of unpredictable demand 
we rely upon our ability to successfully forecast customer demand and to manage our worldwide inventory levels to support this demand in a cost effective manner 
our sales to resellers are made under purchase orders that typically have short delivery requirements 
although we receive periodic order forecasts from our major reseller  they have no obligation to purchase the forecasted amounts and may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice 
we cannot guarantee that our results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected in the future by such changes or cancellations or changes in demand 
we rely upon domestic and foreign suppliers 
our products are manufactured using raw materials and components that are acquired domestically and internationally 
we use a large number of suppliers and regularly evaluate the availability of potential alternate suppliers should circumstances change with existing suppliers 
we internally develop most of the software used in our products 
certain software is purchased from suppliers through royalty agreements 
if we were to 
table of contents experience a sudden loss of availability of purchased raw materials and components or purchased software  we are unable to guarantee that we could quickly obtain the needed items from alternate sources 
our ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected  thus affecting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely upon our international facilities 
we rely heavily upon our international facilities for the manufacture of our products  key components and configuration 
our future operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by several factors  including  but not limited to  failure of our international production and configuration facilities or international suppliers to supply products reliably  disruptions in international trade  or production and supply constraints that could result in additional costs 
also  we rely upon our ability to successfully predict demand and to adjust our worldwide inventories accordingly 
we have international operations  customers and suppliers 
there are many risks associated with international operations  including  but not limited to  the following compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties  health and safety requirements and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  currency fluctuations  economic instability  including inflation and interest rate fluctuations  risk of loss of our international assets due to political or economic instability  competition from foreign suppliers  overlapping or differing tax structures  political or civil turmoil  war or conflict abroad  terrorist attacks and outbreaks of infectious disease such as severe accute respiratory syndrome sars 
for fiscal years   and  international revenue excluding united states sales accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net sales 
we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
the terrorist attacks that occurred around the world and the sars epidemic have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
several possible results of these attacks or future attacks or epidemics could include supply chain disruptions and deferral of customers purchasing decisions  but other potential impacts cannot be predicted 
failure to manage the risks posed by our international operations  customers and suppliers could have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the ability to attract and to retain key  highly qualified personnel  both technical and managerial  is critical to our success 
developing  manufacturing and marketing our products is a complex process and requires significant expertise to meet customers specifications 
competition for personnel  particularly qualified engineers  is keen 
the loss of a significant number of key personnel  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional key 
table of contents personnel in a timely manner could have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our intellectual property is important to our success 
we rely upon patents to protect our intellectual property 
we execute confidentiality and non disclosure agreements as needed and limit access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
we have been granted a total of united states and foreign patents 
our ability to compete successfully and to achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
such infringement claims  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
a third party claiming infringement also may obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which effectively could block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
the departure of any of our key management and technical personnel  or breach of non disclosure obligations  or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition
