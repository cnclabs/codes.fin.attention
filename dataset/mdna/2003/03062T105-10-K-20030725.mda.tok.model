table of contents the company s revolving credit facility matures in april the company expects that it will be able to renew or refinance its revolving credit facility on or before the scheduled maturity date

contractual payment obligations the following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations as of april  in thousands payments due by period after contractual obligations total year years years years debt operating leases total critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the company s estimates 
the company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses 
below is a discussion of the company s accounting policy concerning such allowance 
other accounting policies are disclosed in note b in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level it considers sufficient to cover anticipated losses in the collection of its finance receivables 
the allowance for credit losses is based primarily upon historical and recent credit loss experience  with consideration given to changes in loan characteristics ie  average amount financed and term  delinquency levels  collateral values  economic conditions  and underwriting and collection practices 
the allowance for credit losses is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations 
although it is at least reasonably possible that events or circumstances could occur in the future that are not presently foreseen and actual credit losses may be materially different from the recorded allowance for credit losses  the company believes that it has given appropriate consideration to all relevant factors and reasonable assumptions in determining the allowance for credit losses 
seasonality the company s automobile sales and finance business is seasonal in nature 
the company s third fiscal quarter november through january is historically the slowest period for car and truck sales 
many of the company s operating expenses such as administrative personnel  rent and insurance are fixed and cannot be reduced during periods of decreased sales 
conversely  the company s fourth fiscal quarter february through april is historically the busiest time for car and truck sales as many of the company s customers use income tax refunds as a down payment on the purchase of a vehicle 
further  the company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its finance receivable credit losses 
as a percentage of sales  the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to have lower credit losses averaging over the last seven years  while its second and third fiscal quarters tend to have higher credit losses averaging over the last seven years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk on its financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
in particular  the company has exposure to changes in the federal primary credit rate and the prime interest rate of its lender 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are impacted by its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on interest bearing notes payable 
as described below  a decrease in market interest rates would generally have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
financial instruments consist of fixed rate finance receivables and variable rate notes payable 
the company s finance receivables generally bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
these finance receivables generally have remaining maturities from one to months 
the company s borrowings contain variable interest rates that fluctuate with market interest rates ie  the rate charged on the company s revolving credit facility fluctuates with the prime interest rate of its lender 
however  interest rates charged on finance receivables originated in the state of arkansas are limited to the federal primary credit rate at april  plus 
typically  the company charges interest on its arkansas loans at or near the maximum rate allowed by law 
thus  while the interest rates charged on the company s loans do 
table of contents not fluctuate once established  new loans originated in arkansas are set at a spread above the federal primary credit rate which does fluctuate 
at april  approximately of the company s finance receivables were originated in arkansas 
assuming that this percentage is held constant for future loan originations  the long term effect of decreases in the federal primary credit rate would generally have a negative effect on the profitability of the company 
this is the case because the amount of interest income lost on arkansas originated loans would likely exceed the amount of interest expense saved on the company s variable rate borrowings assuming the prime interest rate of its lender decreases by the same percentage as the decrease in the federal primary credit rate 
the initial impact on profitability resulting from a decrease in the federal primary credit rate and the rate charged on its variable interest rate borrowings is positive  as the immediate interest expense savings would outweigh the loss of interest income on new loan originations 
however  as the amount of new loans originated at the lower interest rate increases to an amount in excess of the amount of variable interest rate borrowings  the effect on profitability would become negative 
the table below illustrates the estimated impact that hypothetical changes in the federal primary credit rate would have on the company s continuing pretax earnings 
the calculations assume i the increase or decrease in the federal primary credit rate remains in effect for two years  ii the increase or decrease in the federal primary credit rate results in a like increase or decrease in the rate charged on the company s variable rate borrowings  iii the principal amount of finance receivables million and variable interest rate borrowings million  and the percentage of arkansas originated finance receivables  remain constant during the periods  and iv the company s historical collection and charge off experience continues throughout the periods 
year year increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease in interest rates in pretax earnings in pretax earnings in thousands in thousands a similar calculation and table was prepared at april  the calculation and table was materially consistent with the information provided above
