item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global biotechnology company with employees located in cambridge  ma  san diego  ca and abingdon  uk 
during we had two operating segments pharmaceuticals and discovery tools and services 
see note t segment information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our operating segments 
our pharmaceuticals business seeks to discover  develop  and commercialize major pharmaceutical products independently and with collaborators 
our proprietary  systematic  genomics based discovery platform is designed to accelerate the discovery of new drugs and to expand intellectual property coverage of drug candidate compounds and classes of related compounds 
we believe this approach  which targets gene families  has formed the basis for successful drug discovery and for the advancement of drug candidates by vertex and its collaborators 
our first approved product is agenerase amprenavir  an hiv protease inhibitor  which we co promote with glaxosmithkline 
we earn a royalty from glaxosmithkline on sales of agenerase 
agenerase is marketed worldwide 
in japan the drug is sold under the trade name prozei 
we have one drug candidate  gw or vx  for which a new drug application nda is pending with the us fda 
we have a total of drug candidates in clinical or pre clinical development including drug candidates focused on infectious diseases  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cancer  as well as other drug candidates targeting neurological disorders and genetic disorders 
we intend to independently develop and commercialize certain of our own products for high value markets where we can effectively reach large patient populations with a sales force focused on specialists 
at the same time  we are collaborating with partners to develop and market other vertex discovered products for selected major therapeutic areas 
we have significant collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies including novartis  aventis  glaxosmithkline and serono  to develop and commercialize drug candidates serving markets where we believe our partner can more effectively compete 
in these collaborations  we have retained rights to downstream product revenue 
our collaborations and contracts in the pharmaceuticals business provide us with financial support and other valuable resources for our research programs  development of our clinical drug candidates  and marketing and sales of our products 
we believe that we are positioned to commercialize multiple products  both independently and with our partners  in the coming years  which we expect will generate increased milestone payments  royalty payments and product revenues 
our discovery tools and services business  part of which we operated through our subsidiary panvera llc  specializes in assay development  screening services  the development  manufacture and sale of instruments  and the manufacture and sale of proteins and reagents 
this business had contracts in place that required the delivery of products  licenses and services throughout and early on february   vertex and panvera llc signed a definitive agreement under which invitrogen corporation agreed to purchase for approximately million in cash certain panvera llc assets  including its biochemical and cellular assay capabilities and its commercial portfolio of proprietary reagents  probes and proteins 
the buyer also assumed certain liabilities of panvera llc 
the sale does not include the instrumentation assets of the discovery tools and services business 
this sale of assets was completed on march  in connection with the panvera llc asset sale  we have agreed with invitrogen that we may use in our drug discovery activities  but will not engage for a term of five years in the business of providing  reagents  probes  or assay development services 
we will also purchase a minimum of million of products annually from invitrogen for three years after completion of the asset sale 
on july   we completed a merger with aurora biosciences corporation 
the merger united aurora s industry leading cell biology capabilities with vertex s integrated drug discovery expertise  creating a comprehensive  scalable platform for systematically accelerating drug candidate output in target rich gene families 
we acquired all of aurora s outstanding common stock in a tax free  stock for stock transaction  for approximately million shares of vertex common stock 
aurora s outstanding options were converted into options to purchase million shares of vertex common stock 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on march   aurora completed a merger with panvera corporation 
aurora acquired all of panvera corporation s outstanding common stock in a tax free  stock for stock transaction 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all references to aurora refer to the combined company of aurora and panvera corporation 
all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows of aurora as though the merger had been in effect on the dates indicated 
we consider our collaborations with novartis  glaxosmithkline  aventis and serono to be material to our business 
novartis has agreed to pay us up to approximately million in pre commercial payments  comprised of a million up front payment made upon the signing of the agreement in may  up to million in product research funding over six years and up to approximately million in further license fees  milestone payments and cost reimbursements 
these amounts are based on the successful development of eight drug candidates 
we have the responsibility for drug discovery and clinical proof of concept testing for all drug candidates 
under our agreement  novartis has created a million loan facility to support our clinical studies  which we may draw down in increments of up to million for each drug candidate 
the loans are interest free and novartis will forgive the full amount of any advances if novartis accepts the drug candidate for development under our agreement 
during we drew down million against the loan facility to support our early development efforts related to a particular drug candidate 
additionally  we will receive royalties on any products marketed as a part of the collaboration 
subject to certain conditions  we will have co promotion rights in the us and europe 
upon one year s written notice  novartis may terminate this agreement without cause  effective no earlier than may  we are engaged in a collaborative agreement with glaxosmithkline gsk to develop and commercialize hiv protease inhibitors  including agenerase amprenavir  its prodrug  and vx under our agreement  gsk agreed to pay the company up to million comprised of an up front license payment  product research funding over five years  and development and commercialization milestone payments for an initial drug candidate 
we have received the entire million and in began receiving royalties on sales of agenerase 
gsk is also obligated to pay additional development and commercialization milestone payments for subsequent drug candidates  including in the fourth quarter of we received a milestone payment of million for the submission of a new drug application for market approval of in the us and european union 
gsk is required to bear the costs of development in its territory of drug candidates under the collaboration and has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize vertex hiv protease inhibitors in all parts of the world except the far east and will pay vertex a royalty on sales 
we have retained certain bulk drug manufacturing rights and certain co promotion rights in territories licensed to gsk 
gsk has the right to terminate its arrangement without cause upon twelve months notice 
termination of the agreement by gsk will relieve it of its obligation to make further commercialization and development milestone and royalty payments and will end any license granted to gsk by vertex under the agreement 
aventis has paid us million up front for prior research costs associated with pralnacasan vx and has agreed to pay us up to million in milestone payments for successful development by aventis of pralnacasan in rheumatoid arthritis  the first targeted indication 
milestone payments are also due for each additional indication under development 
aventis initiated a phase iia study for an additional indication  osteoarthritis  in january we have granted aventis an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and market pralnacasan  as well as an exclusive option for certain other compounds discovered as part of the research collaboration between vertex and aventis that ended in we will receive royalties on product sales and reimbursement of certain co promotion expenses 
aventis has the right to terminate this agreement without cause upon six months notice 
serono has agreed to pay us up to million in pre commercial payments in conjunction with the december agreement to collaborate on the discovery  development  and commercialization of caspase inhibitors 
the million in pre commercial payments is comprised of million in up front payments for prior research  up to million in product research funding over five years and up to million in further license fees and milestone payments for the successful development and commercialization of one or more drug candidates 
we will share development costs 
we have the option to establish a joint venture for the commercialization of products in north america  where we will share marketing rights and profits from the sale of drug products 
serono will have exclusive rights to market caspase inhibitors in other territories  excluding japan and certain other countries in the far east  and will pay us for supplies of drug substance 
serono has the right to terminate the agreement without cause upon days written notice  effective september  financial guidance on february  we provided financial guidance for which we believed reflected the stage of development of our business  research and development opportunities  our infrastructure needs and our capital structure and liquidity profile 
the key financial metrics on which we provided guidance are as follows pharmaceutical collaborative and royalty revenues are expected to be between million and million  including million from existing collaborations  million from royalty arrangements and between million and million from new collaborations 
discovery tools and services revenues will be less than million  reflecting the panvera llc asset sale closed on march  as we advance the development of vertex driven drug candidates and continue to invest in drug discovery  we project that research and development costs will be between million and million for the full year 
this compares to research and development expense of million 
this increase in expense is due to increased investment in the development of vertex driven drug candidates  while maintaining an investment in research consistent with we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to be between million and million for the full year 
the full year net loss is expected to be between million and million  excluding gain from the close of the sale of certain net assets of panvera llc  which we expect to be in excess of million 
the net loss range is expected to be consistent with the net loss from the pharmaceuticals segment of our business 
we expect cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities to be in excess of million at the end of we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we plan to make significant investments in research and development for our drug candidates 
we also expect that losses will fluctuate from year to year and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
the results set forth above are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially  as referenced in the section below entitled forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are constantly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their critical accounting policies in the section of their periodic reports entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is a policy that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
while our significant accounting polices are more fully described in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider our revenue recognition and research and development policies critical and therefore we separately outline these policies below 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
our pharmaceuticals business generates revenue mainly from collaborative research and development agreements and royalty agreements  while our discovery tools and services business generates revenue mainly from product sales  assay development and screening services 
following the sale of the panvera assets we expect our near term revenue to be generated mainly from our pharmaceuticals business 
our collaborative research and development revenue is primarily generated through collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners for the development of small molecule drugs that address major unmet medical needs 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable up front license fees  funding of research and development efforts  payments based upon achievement of certain at risk and substantive milestones and royalties on product sales 
under the substantive milestone method  adopted retroactively to january   we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front license fees and milestones  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed 
if our estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens  the amount of revenue we recognize from non refundable  up front license fees and milestones  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known  future related revenues would be adjusted accordingly 
research funding is recognized as earned  ratably over the period of effort 
milestones that are based on designated achievement points and that are considered at risk and substantive at the inception of the collaborative contract  are recognized as earned  when the corresponding payment is considered reasonably assured 
we evaluate whether milestones are at risk and substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that must be overcome and the level of investment required 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories  as provided by our collaborative partner  and is recognized in the period the sales occur 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues  which have not been historically significant  are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known 
product sales include technology licensing  instrumentation system sales  and biotechnology product sales 
revenue from licenses involving continuing obligations on our part is recognized over the period of the license 
revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized when the license is issued  provided that there are no significant continuing obligations and the payment is non refundable and non creditable 
revenue from biotechnology products and certain instrumentation system sales  is recognized upon shipment  when the title to the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and  if applicable  upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified  or upon expiration of the acceptance period 
sales under long term production contracts are recognized using percentage of completion accounting  based on actual costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs to complete 
changes in estimates of costs to complete will impact revenue recognition under the percentage of completion accounting model in the period the change becomes known and all future periods would be adjusted accordingly 
funding for the development of prototype instrumentation systems was recognized ratably over the term of the related development agreements  which approximated costs incurred 
milestones related to delivery of the components of the prototype systems were recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement of acceptance from the customer 
service revenues include assay development  screening services and contracted product development 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the service period if we believe such method will approximate the expense being incurred 
revenue from upfront fees is deferred and recognized over the service period 
changes in the length of the service period could impact revenue in the period the change in the estimate of the service period becomes known and related future period revenues would be adjusted accordingly 
certain contracts of our discovery tools and services business contain obligations to sell instrumentation systems and technology licenses in addition to providing assay development and screening services 
each of these separable elements may be individually delivered and is not considered essential to the functionality of the others 
we allocate revenue under such contracts to each of the separable elements based on the relative fair value of each element  which under most of our agreements approximates the stated price in the contract 
all research and development costs  including amounts funded in research collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities costs  overhead costs  clinical trial costs  contract services and other outside costs 
results of operations in the third quarter of  in connection with our overall review of accounting policies concurrent with our merger with aurora  we elected to change our revenue recognition policy for collaborative research and development revenues from the emerging issues task force no 
eitf method to the substantive milestone method  adopted retroactive to january  we believe this method is preferable because it is reflective of the company s on going business operations and is more consistent with the industry practices following the prior year implementation of sab throughout the biotechnology industry 
pursuant to the change  we recorded a one time  non cash charge of  representing a cumulative change in accounting principle for periods prior to the amount of revenue recognized in and which was included in the one time  non cash charge was  and additionally    and  will be recognized as revenue in  and thereafter  respectively  which was included in the january charge to income 
prior to our change of revenue recognition to the substantive milestone method  in the fourth quarter of we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition for collaborative research and development revenues to the eitf method in conjunction with our adoption of sab under the eitf method  adopted retroactive to january   we recognized revenue from research and development arrangements  including non refundable upfront license fees  milestones and research and development funding  over the period of our continuing involvement using the lesser of the non refundable cash received or the result achieved using percentage of completion accounting 
where we had no continuing involvement  non refundable license fees were recorded as revenue upon receipt and milestones were recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone by the collaborative partner 
pursuant to the adoption of sab and the eitf method in  we recorded a one time  non cash charge of  representing a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for periods prior to year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was  or per basic and diluted common share  compared to a net loss for of  or per basic and diluted common share 
our loss in includes the effect of changes in accounting principles related to revenue recognition  as discussed above  and the adoption of derivative implementation group no 
a  of  merger related expenses of  and a gain of  on the retirement of  in principal of our convertible subordinated notes 
total revenues decreased to  in compared to  in in  pharmaceuticals revenue  totaling  was comprised of  in royalties and  in collaborative research and development revenue  as compared with  comprised of  in royalties and  in collaborative research and development revenue in in  discovery tools and services revenue  totaling  was comprised of  in product sales and royalties and  in service revenue  as compared with  comprised of  in product sales and royalties  and  in service revenue in pharmaceuticals royalties consist primarily of agenerase royalty revenue 
agenerase royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of agenerase 
collaborative research and development revenue consists of research support payments  development reimbursements  milestones and amortization of previously received up front or license payments 
collaborative research and development revenue increased in by or  as compared with  due primarily to additional revenue earned under our novartis collaboration 
in we recognized  of revenue under the novartis collaboration compared with  in we increased our effort related to the kinase research program under the novartis collaboration in revenue recognized under the hcv protease program under the eli lilly lilly contract was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  our research and development agreement with lilly was restructured 
the original contractual research term was to conclude in june in connection with the restructuring of the agreement and termination of the research term  described more fully in note o in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we recognized  in revenue that had been previously deferred 
that revenue related to the milestone paid in december and the upfront payment received in june at the commencement of the research and development collaboration 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of we received and recognized a milestone payment of  from glaxosmithkline in connection with the submission of a new drug application for market approval of in the us and the european union 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in research funding of  related to the conclusion of our collaboration with taisho in the third quarter of as well as decreases in development reimbursement revenue earned under our collaboration with kissei 
we expect that collaborative research and development revenues will continue to be a significant source of our revenue 
our research programs with taisho  schering and eli lilly concluded during therefore  research funding which we expect to receive from existing collaborators will be lower in as compared with product sales and royalties include instrumentation sales  technology licensing and biotechnology product sales 
product sales and royalties decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease in product sales in from is due primarily to a decrease in instrumentation revenue and biotechnology product revenue from our discovery tools and services business 
instrumentation revenue decreased as the result of the completion of certain significant projects in late as well as a large equipment sale in late that was not repeated in additionally  during late and throughout the discovery tools and services business continued to shift its strategic focus away from instrumentation sales and towards technology licensing  assay development and the manufacture and sale of proteins  reagents and probes 
the strategic shift of certain resources and technologies from our discovery tools and services business to our pharmaceuticals business has also impacted discovery tools and services revenue 
however  this shift contributed to the establishment of a fully integrated drug discovery operation focused on molecular targets  including the ion channels gene family 
service revenue includes assay development  screening services and contracted product development 
service revenue decreased to  in from  in the decrease is a result of the completion of several significant screening arrangements in late that were not replaced as a result of the shift in strategic focus of our business towards pharmaceuticals 
we expect discovery tools and services revenue to decrease in as a result of the sale of certain panvera llc assets to invitrogen in the first quarter of see note r subsequent event for further information regarding the sale 
pharmaceutical royalty costs of  and  in and  respectively  consists of royalty payments on the sales of agenerase 
cost of product sales and royalties decreased  or to  in from  in the decrease in product and royalty costs is the result of the completion of certain projects that were not replaced in the current year 
additionally  the focus in our discovery tools and services business toward technology licensing and discovery tools  which have higher gross margins  and away from instrumentation sales  with lower gross margins  contributed to a larger decrease in product costs from to  as compared with the relative decrease in product sales from to cost of service revenue decreased from  in to  in the decrease is primarily due to decreased service revenue partially offset by higher overhead costs for the year ended december  the increased overhead is a result of a strategic shift in focus away from instrumentation in the discovery tools and services business and a resulting reallocation of fixed overhead 
as a result of the sale of certain panvera llc assets to invitrogen in the first quarter of  we expect the cost of revenues related to discovery tools and services revenue to decrease in research and development expenses increased to  in from  in  primarily due to our continued investment in advancing our broad clinical pipeline and broadening our research efforts 
our clinical investment was focused primarily on the advancement of our second generation p map kinase  impdh  hcv protease and ice inhibitors 
we currently are concentrating on large market opportunities such as certain inflammatory  autoimmune and viral diseases 
we continued to expand our multi target gene family research programs  of which our kinases program is the most advanced  along with investments in target families such as ion channels and proteases 
as a result of our continued expansion  personnel and facilities expenses also increased 
we have drug candidates in development targeting a range of major diseases 
our collaborative partners have agreed to fund portions of our research and development programs and or to conduct certain research and development related to specified drug candidates 
our research and development expenses for  and were as follows research development total research development total research development total collaborator sponsored     company sponsored      total       to date we have incurred in excess of  in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we add personnel and capabilities to support the advancement of vertex driven drug candidates 
we do not expect a significant increase in research expenses without significant new funding from collaborations 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase is primarily attributable to increased personnel and professional expenses 
included in the increase in personnel and professional expenses is an increase in our legal and patent expenses in the period related to continued protection of our intellectual property and activities contesting a suit filed by oregon health sciences university 
merger related costs of  in consisted of investment banking  legal and accounting fees associated with the acquisition of aurora completed on july  interest income decreased approximately  to  in from  in the decrease is a result of lower funds invested and lower portfolio yields due to a depressed interest rate environment 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from  in the decrease is a result of the reduction in principal amount of our convertible notes 
in october  we repurchased  in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due september and recorded a gain of  on the retirement of the convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  recission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
fas recinds fas and fas  which addressed the accounting for gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
under fas the gain on retirement of convertible subordinated notes is considered an ordinary item 
previously  the gain on retirement of convertible subordinated notes was classified as an extraordinary item 
the item has been reclassified 
at december  and   of the convertible subordinated notes was outstanding 
using the equity method of accounting  we recorded  as our share of loss in altus biologics inc altus  for the year ended december  the loss is included in other expense on the statement of operations 
effective september   coincident with a financial restructuring of altus  we changed our method of accounting for altus from the equity method to the cost method 
see note h to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
effective july   we adopted derivative implementation group issue no 
a  contracts that provide for net share settlement dig a 
pursuant to the adoption of dig a  we recorded a  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the value of warrants held in altus 
this amount is included in investments in the december  balance sheet 
as of september   the warrants no longer qualified as derivatives under dig a due to changes in the terms of the warrants coincident with a financial restructuring of altus 
overview of research and development investment we estimate that it takes to years the industry average is years to discover  develop and bring to market a pharmaceutical product 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda as outlined below phase objective estimated duration discovery lead identification and target validation to years pre clinical toxicology to identify risks for humans  gather early pharmacokentic data to years phase i establish safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs to years phase ii establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage to years phase iii confirm efficacy  dosage regime and safety profile of the drug to years fda approval approval by the fda to sell and market the drug under certain prescribed labeling mths to years the successful development of our products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and the cost related to discovery  pre clinical and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
the most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with phase ii and phase iii clinical trials 
set forth below is a description of our drug candidates currently in preclinical and clinical development vertex driven programs drug candidate clinical indications phase program collaborator infectious disease merimepodib vx chronic hepatitis c ii impdh vx chronic hepatitis c preclin hepatitis c protease inflammation and autoimmune disease vx psoriasis  autoimmune diseases ii impdh vx acute coronary syndromes  inflammatory diseases i p map kinase kissei vx autoimmune diseases i impdh vx inflammatory diseases preclin ice vx inflammatory diseases preclin p map kinease genetic disorders vx multiple indications i histone deacetylase partner driven programs drug candidate clinical indications phase program collaborator infectious disease vx gw  hiv nda maa filed hiv glaxosmithkline vx hiv i hiv glaxosmithkline vx sepsis preclin caspases serono inflammation and autoimmune disease pralnacasan vx rheumatoid arthritis ra  osteoarthritis oa  other inflammatory diseases ii ice aventis cancer vx oncology preclin kinase novartis vx oncology preclin kinase novartis neurology vx stroke and other neurological indications preclin kinase novartis in  our clinical and commercial teams are focused on key development activities for five major vertex driven programs  where we currently retain most or all of the downstream commercial rights 
vx is in phase ii clinical development for the treatment of psoriasis  an autoimmune disease affecting an estimated million individuals in the united states 
a safe  oral therapy would provide an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis 
vx is a p map kinase inhibitor targeting treatment of inflammatory diseases including acute coronary syndromes acs 
p map kinase inhibition represents a novel approach directed at the underlying inflammatory response observed in acute cardiovascular events  which afflict nearly million patients in the us each year 
we expect to begin a phase ii study in acs in the second quarter of additionally  we are planning to investigate the clinical potential of vx in one or more chronic inflammatory diseases 
vx is an oral ice inhibitor that we expect to enter phase i clinical evaluation targeting inflammatory diseases in the second quarter of our first ice inhibitor  pralnacasan  has demonstrated excellent tolerability in clinical studies and has shown clinical benefit in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
vx represents a new class of antiviral drugs that could directly inhibit hepatitis c viral replication 
we are confident that direct antiviral therapies for hepatitis c viral infection have the potential to be an important new treatment option 
we expect to begin phase i clinical studies of vx in the second half of year vx is a small molecule modulator of gene expression currently in phase i clinical evaluation 
by increasing the expression of proteins absent or deficient in certain disorders  vx may provide a novel approach for the treatment of sickle cell and other genetic diseases 
based on clinical activities planned or underway for  we expect to have clinical data in hand by the end of this year which will help us to select two drug candidates from our vertex driven portfolio as priority candidates for clinical development and commercialization by vertex in the us partnerships have played an important role in the growth and advancement of our pipeline 
our first drug  the hiv protease inhibitor agenerase  was developed and commercialized in collaboration with glaxosmithkline gsk 
our most advanced drug candidate  currently named or vx  is an hiv protease inhibitor that we will also co promote with gsk  if the new drug application filed by gsk in december is approved by the fda  which we believe could happen during the fourth quarter of we believe that s convenient dosing regimen  low pill count and good tolerability will make it competitive with market leading hiv protease inhibitors 
vertex and aventis are making clinical progress with pralnacasan  a first in class  oral anti cytokine therapy which has shown anti inflammatory effects in phase ii clinical studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra 
in the first half of  aventis is planning to initiate a large phase iib study in patients with ra 
aventis has also initiated a phase ii  patient proof of concept study of pralnacasan in osteoarthritis oa  a debilitating disease that afflicts an estimated million people worldwide 
in our broad based kinase research program  which we are conducting in collaboration with novartis  we selected three novel kinase inhibitors during  for preclinical development targeting cancer and stroke 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was  or per basic and diluted common share compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted common share 
the following discussions relating to revenue for the year ended december  reflect the pro forma results as if we had followed the substantive milestone method of revenue recognition from our inception 
actual results for reflect the adoption of the substantive milestone method as of january  the table below details actual revenue recorded for the year ended december  compared to proforma revenue as if we had followed the substantive milestone method from our inception for the year ended december  actual proforma pharmaceuticals revenues collaborative research and development revenues   royalties   discovery tools and services revenues product sales and royalties   service revenues   total revenues   substantive milestone method of revenue recognition applied 
total revenues increased to  in compared to  in in  pharmaceuticals revenue totaling  was comprised of  in royalties and  in collaborative research and development revenue  as compared with  comprised of  in royalties   in collaborative research and development revenue in in  discovery tools and services revenue totaling  was comprised of  in product sales and royalties and  in service revenue  as compared with  comprised of  in product sales and royalties  and  in service revenue collaborative research and development revenue increased in by or  as compared with in we recognized  of revenue under the novartis collaboration compared with  in in an agreement signed in may  we agreed with novartis to collaborate to discover  develop and commercialize small molecule drugs targeted at the kinase protein family 
effort related to the kinase research program increased significantly in in december we entered into a collaboration agreement with serono to discover  develop and market caspase inhibitors 
in connection with the serono agreement we recognized  in revenue during compared with  during in may we received and recognized as revenue a  license payment from aventis under a collaborative agreement covering the development of pralnacasan vx  an orally active inhibitor of interleukin beta converting enzyme 
the balance of collaborative and other research and development revenue for and is made up of research support payments  development reimbursements and milestones from other collaborative partners 
pharmaceutical royalty costs of  and  in and  respectively  consist primarily of royalty payments on the sales of agenerase 
product sales and royalties increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in product sales in from is due to increased technology licensing revenue and increased biotechnology product revenue  partially offset by a decrease in instrumentation revenue 
instrumentation revenue decreased in from due to the completion and delivery of several significant products and services in late and early that have not been replaced  due in part to a strategic shift in focus towards technology licensing and discovery service activity 
the increase in biotechnology revenue is attributed to a continued increase in demand for proteins  drug screening assays and other biotechnology products 
service revenue increased to  in from  in the increase in service revenue is attributable to new strategic alliances and screening collaborations entered into in late and early cost of product sales and royalties decreased  or to  in from  in the decrease in product and royalty costs is attributable to a strategic shift in focus towards technology licensing and discovery services activity 
instrumentation revenue  which has lower gross margins  decreased during the year  while technology license and biotechnology product revenue  which has higher gross margins  increased during the year 
cost of service revenue increased from  in to  in  primarily due to a related increase in service revenue 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in primarily due to the continued expansion of our research and development operations  an increase in the number of drug development candidates from eight candidates at december  to more than twelve candidates at december  and the continued shift of aurora s strategy towards drug discovery activity 
during there was a significant increase in research and discovery activities associated with our gene family programs  specifically our kinase research program being conducted under our novartis collaboration  and our protease research program 
development expenses increased as we continued to advance our drug candidates with substantial investment in our p map kinase specifically vx and our impdh programs 
also related to our expansion were increases in personnel  facilities expenses and equipment depreciation 
sales  general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent totaling  in compared with  in merger related costs of  in consisted of investment banking  legal and accounting fees associated with the acquisition of aurora  which was completed on july  interest income increased approximately  to  in from  in the increase is due to a higher level of cash and marketable securities for the full year of compared with the increase in cash and marketable securities is primarily a result of the proceeds received from the issuance in september of  of convertible subordinated notes due september september notes 
in march we issued  of convertible subordinated notes march notes  which we called for redemption in september and which were subsequently converted to equity 
interest expense increased to approximately  in from  in the increase is due to interest expense associated with the september notes

in order to help finance our substantial cash needs in the future  we anticipate entering into additional strategic collaborations  specifically in our pharmaceuticals business 
we expect these collaborations to provide us with significant sources of cash and revenue in the near and long term 
in  we did not enter into any new strategic collaborations 
additionally  we will rely on cash receipts from research funding  development reimbursements and potential milestone payments from our existing collaborators  as we continue to advance our research and development programs in our collaboration with taisho  and our research programs with schering and eli lilly reached conclusion during funding to be received from existing collaborators therefore will be lower in as compared with in connection with the sale of certain assets of panvera llc to invitrogen described more fully in note r to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we will receive approximately million in cash in the first quarter of we expect to record a gain  net of transaction costs  in excess of million

novartis created a  loan facility to support certain clinical studies  which we may draw down in amounts aggregating up to  for each drug candidate 
the loans are interest free and novartis will forgive the full amount of any advances with respect to a particular drug candidate if novartis accepts that drug candidate for development under the agreement 
we expect to continue to draw down on the loan facility to fund certain development activities for drug candidates in the kinase research program

legal proceedings chiron corporation filed suit on july  against vertex and eli lilly and company in the united states district court for the northern district of california  alleging infringement by the defendants of three us patents issued to chiron 
the infringement action relates to research activities by the defendants in the hepatitis c viral protease field and the alleged use of inventions claimed by chiron in connection with that research 
chiron has requested damages in an unspecified amount  as well as an order permanently enjoining the defendants from unlicensed use of the claimed chiron inventions 
during  chiron requested and was granted a reexamination by the us patent and trademark office of all three of the patents involved in the suit 
chiron also requested and  over the opposition of vertex and eli lilly  was granted a stay in the infringement lawsuit  pending the outcome of the patent re examination 
that reexamination proceeding is still on going and the stay is still in effect 
however  a reexamination certificate has been issued in two of the three chiron patents involved and a notice of intent to issue a reexamination certificate has been issued with respect to the third patent 
while the length of the stay and the final outcome of the lawsuit cannot be determined  we maintain that chiron s claims are without merit  and we intend to defend the lawsuit  if and when it resumes  vigorously 
on december  oregon health sciences university filed suit against vertex in the district court of oregon 
the complaint in the suit seeks to name dr 
bruce gold  an employee of oregon health sciences university  as an inventor and oregon health sciences university as part owner of five of vertex s neurophilin patents  and associated damages 
one of the five patents has recently been removed from the suit on a motion by vertex 
the suit stems from assays run on vertex compounds by dr 
gold under a sponsored research agreement in we have investigated the inventorship on these patents and believe that dr 
gold is not an inventor  oregon health sciences has no ownership interest in any of these patents  and that the claims made in this complaint are without merit 
we intend to contest this suit vigorously

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its investment portfolio  vertex owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve vertex s capital until it is required to fund operations  including vertex s research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
vertex does not have derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
interest rate risk vertex invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of its interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of vertex s investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and vertex has implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of its investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  vertex does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk
