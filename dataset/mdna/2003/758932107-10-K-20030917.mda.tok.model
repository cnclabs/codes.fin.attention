table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary regis corporation  based in minneapolis  minnesota  is the world s largest owner  operator and franchisor of hair and retail product salons 
the regis worldwide operations include  domestic and international salons at june  each of the company s concepts have generally similar products and services 
the company is organized to manage its operations based on geographical location 
the company s domestic operations includes  salons  including  franchised salons  operating primarily under the trade names of regis salons  mastercuts  trade secret  smartstyle  supercuts and cost cutters 
the company s international operations include  salons  including  franchised salons  located throughout europe  primarily in the united kingdom  france  italy and spain 
the company has approximately  employees worldwide 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that could have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually or at any time events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
according to the company s accounting policy  an annual review was performed during the third quarter of fiscal year  and no impairment was identified 
a similar review will be performed in the third quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the company s impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates of revenues for the reporting units  driven by assumed same store sales rates  estimated future gross margins and expense rates  as well as acquisition integration and maturation  and appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that are used to manage the underlying businesses 
charges for impairment of goodwill for a reporting unit may be incurred in the future if the reporting unit fails to achieve its assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin  or if interest rates increase significantly 
the company generally considers its various concepts to be reporting units when it tests for goodwill impairment because that is where the company believes goodwill naturally resides 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  goodwill was tested for impairment in this manner 
the net book value of the recently purchased european franchise operations approximated its fair value and the estimated fair value of the remaining reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts  indicating no impairment of goodwill 

table of contents long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors considered in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of an individual salon in relation to expectations  significant economic or geographic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in the company s use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 
purchase price allocation the company makes numerous acquisitions which are now required to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the purchase prices are allocated to assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
fair value is estimated based on the amount for which the asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
for the company s acquisitions  the majority of the purchase price is accounted for as residual goodwill rather than identifiable intangible assets 
this stems from the value associated with the walk in customer base of the acquired salons  the value of which is not recorded as an identifiable intangible asset under current accounting guidance and the limited value and customer preference associated with the acquired hair salon brand 
residual goodwill further represents the company s opportunity to strategically combine the acquired business with the company s existing structure to serve a greater number of customers through its expansion strategies 
cost of product used and sold product costs are determined by applying estimated gross profit margins to service and product revenues  which are based on historical factors including product pricing trends and estimated shrinkage 
in addition  the estimated gross profit margin is adjusted based on the results of physical inventory counts performed at least twice a year 
during fiscal year  the company performed physical inventory counts in september  january and march and adjusted its estimated gross profit margin to reflect the results of the observations 
significant changes in product costs  volumes or shrinkage could have a material impact on the company s gross margin 

table of contents contingencies the company is involved in various lawsuits and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
accruals are recorded for such contingencies based on our assessment that the occurrence is probable  and where determinable  an estimate of the liability amount 
management considers many factors in making these assessments including past history and the specifics of each case 
however  litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur  which could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgements 
certain of these estimates and judgements occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
management must assess the likelihood that the company will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the company must increase its provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that management estimates will not be ultimately recoverable 
as of june   management believes that all of its recorded deferred tax assets will ultimately be recoverable 
however  should there be a change in the company s ability to recover its deferred tax assets  the company s tax provision would increase in the period in which it is determined that the recovery is not probable 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
management recognizes potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when management determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if management s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result

the associated effective tax rate on these businesses resulted in the change to from percent  absent the unrelated fiscal year one time benefit described above

effects of inflation the company primarily compensates its salon employees with percentage commissions based on sales they generate  thereby enabling salon payroll expense as a percent of revenues to remain relatively constant
