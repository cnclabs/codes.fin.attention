item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  compared to 
competition the company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation  extensive research efforts and significant competition 
in general  theraseed competes with conventional methods of treating localized cancer  such as rp and ebrt  as well as competing permanent implant devices 
rp currently represents the most common medical treatment for early stage  localized prostate cancer 
rp has a long history of favorable clinical results and physicians have developed a high degree of familiarity and comfort with this procedure 
ebrt is also a well established method of treatment and is widely accepted for patients who do not represent a good surgical risk or whose prostate cancer has advanced beyond the stage for which surgical treatment is indicated 
management cannot predict with any certainty whether general conversion from these treatment options or other established or conventional procedures to theraseed treatment may occur 
management does  however  believe that if general conversion from these treatment options or other established or conventional procedures to theraseed treatment does occur  such conversion will be the result of a combination of equivalent or better efficacy  reduced incidence of side effects and complications  lower cost  other quality of life issues and pressure by health care providers and patients 
while theragenics is in an industry that is currently experiencing market consolidation  management continues to believe that theragenics has certain competitive advantages over other pd and i seed producers that include i its proprietary production processes that have been developed and patented  ii its record of reliability and safety in its manufacturing operations and iii the time and resources required for competitors production capabilities to ramp up to commercial production on a scale comparable to theragenics 
furthermore  the company expects to continue activities in an attempt support its brand name and increase demand for theraseed implants including advertising to physicians  clinical studies aimed at showing the advantages of theraseed implants in the treatment of prostate cancer  technical field support to theraseed customers  and other customer service and patient information activities 
management also believes that pd continues to have certain advantages over i  including i higher dose rates  which can yield advantages in treating aggressive cancers  ii a shorter half life  which shortens the duration of some radiation induced side effects by two thirds  and iii reduces radiation exposure to medical personnel in treatment follow up 
at any point in time  management of theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for theraseed in order to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on the prices of theraseed and or could have a favorable effect on market share and volumes  while failure to do so could adversely affect market share and volumes although per unit pricing could possibly be maintained 
in addition to the competition referenced above  many companies  both public and private  are researching new and innovative methods of preventing and treating cancer 
in addition  many companies  including many large  well known pharmaceutical  medical device and chemical companies that have significant resources available to them  are engaged in radiological pharmaceutical and device research 
these companies are located in the united states  europe and throughout the world 
significant developments by any of these companies could have a material adverse effect on the demand for theragenics products 
government regulation the company s present and future intended activities in the development  manufacture and sale of cancer therapy products are subject to extensive laws  regulations  regulatory approvals and guidelines 
within the united states  the company s therapeutic radiological device must comply with the us federal food  drug and cosmetic act  which is enforced by the fda 
as a result of receiving its ce marking during  the company must also comply with the regulations of the competent authorities of the european union for theraseed sold in the member nations of the european union 
the company is also required to adhere to applicable fda regulations for good manufacturing practices  including extensive record keeping and periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities 
the company obtained fda k clearance in to market theraseed for  in general  the treatment of localized solid tumors 
a new k clearance would be required for any modifications in the device or its labeling that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the original product 
the company s handling of radioactive materials is governed by the state of georgia in agreement with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
the users of theraseed are also required to possess licenses issued either by the states in which they reside or the nrc depending upon the state involved and the production process used 
the company s expansion plans require the company to secure additional permits and licenses from a number of environmental  health and safety regulatory agencies 
the company believes  but cannot assure  that it will be able to acquire the permits and licenses necessary for its planned expansion of its manufacturing capacity in accordance with its timetable 
to date  the company has not experienced delays in licensing any of its facilities or cyclotrons 
the company is required under its radioactive materials license to maintain radiation control and radiation safety personnel  procedures  equipment and processes  and to monitor its facilities and its employees and contractors 
the company is also required to provide financial assurance that adequate funding will exist for end of life radiological decommissioning of its cyclotrons and other radioactive areas of its property that contain radioactive materials 
the company s decommissioning obligations will increase as its production capacity is expanded 
the company disposes of low level radioactive waste to licensed commercial radioactive waste treatment or disposal facilities for incineration or land disposal 
management believes the company is in compliance with all state and federal regulations in this regard 
the company provides training and monitoring of its personnel to facilitate the proper handling of all materials 
the us department of energy has granted theragenics access to unique doe technology  known as the psp  for use in production of isotopes 
us government export control laws and regulations govern the exporting of certain products produced in the psp and the exporting of technology associated with the psp 
employees as of december   the company had full time employees including full time temporary employees and executive personnel 
of this total  were engaged in the development and production of the company s products 
the remainder were engaged in marketing and general corporate activities 
the company s employees are not represented by a union or a collective bargaining agreement  and management considers employee relations to be good

item legal proceedings in january  the company and certain of its officers and directors were named as defendants in certain securities actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws  including sections b  a and rule b of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
these actions have been consolidated into a single action pending in the us district court for the northern district of georgia 
the complaint  as amended  purports to represent a class of investors who purchased or sold securities during the time period from january  to january  the amended complaint generally alleges that the defendants made certain misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the performance of the company during the class period and seeks unspecified damages 
on may  a stockholder of the company filed a derivative complaint in the delaware court of chancery purportedly on behalf of the company  alleging that certain directors breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in the conduct that is alleged in the consolidated federal class action complaint 
the derivative action has been stayed by the agreement of the parties 
on july   the court granted the company s motion to dismiss the consolidated federal class action complaint for failure to state a claim against the company  and granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint 
on august   the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint and on march   the court denied the defendant s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs second amended complaint 
the court also denied the company s motion for reconsideration 
subsequently  the court certified the class and the parties commenced discovery 
discovery in the case is now nearing completion 
management believes these charges are without merit and is opposing the litigation vigorously  however  given the nature and stage of the proceedings  the ultimate outcome of the litigation cannot be determined at this time 
accordingly  no provision for any liability that might result from this litigation has been made 
the company maintains insurance for claims of this general nature

theragenics is the world s leading producer of palladium pd  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for its theraseed implant 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed product 
theraseed has also been approved for marketing throughout the member countries of the european union by obtaining its ce mark 
sales of theraseed in europe have not been significant 
from may until august  substantially all theraseed implants for the treatment of prostate cancer were sold through an exclusive distributor 
all contractual obligations in the agreement were terminated upon notice received in august  ending theragenics reliance on an exclusive distributor 
the contract was subsequently terminated in january the company currently sells its theraseed implants directly to physicians and non exclusive third party distributors 
the company has an active and ongoing program targeted at diversifying its future revenue stream 
as part of this program the company constructed a facility in the oak ridge  tennessee area to house the equipment  infrastructure and work force necessary to support the production of isotopes  including pd  using unique plasma separation process psp technology being leased from the us department of energy 
psp technology is a method of separating relatively large quantities of a specific isotope from a specific element 
in the past this technology had demonstrated the ability to produce material for the us government to support nuclear power generation 
in july theragenics signed an agreement with an international nuclear services company to produce test quantities of certain gadolinium isotopes for purchase by such company 
the gadolinium that will be produced for the international nuclear services company will be used for a non medical application 
the company believes that the psp technology enables current and future feasibility runs designed to validate isotope usage in various markets and industries in addition to possibly increasing the company s manufacturing capacity and allowing for expanded use of pd in other applications 
costs associated with the oak ridge facility and psp project were capitalized for a portion of however  the results for may reflect a decline in margins as expenses related to the oak ridge facility and equipment are recognized for the full year 
research and development r d initiatives are also underway to support the company s diversification program 
following the approval of the investigational device exemption granted by the u 
s 
food and drug administration in august to initiate the therap clinical trial  theragenics began a clinical trial using a patented palladium device early in the company s device  called the therasource intravascular brachytherapy system  is designed to prevent restenosis or renarrowing of arteries following treatment of peripheral vascular disease by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
the trial was initiated at the fuqua heart center of atlanta at piedmont hospital 
a total of patients in up to three centers will be enrolled to study the safety and feasibility of the system 
additionally  an animal pilot study using pd in a prototype device designed for the treatment of age related macular degeneration  a disease that leads to loss of eyesight and in some cases complete blindness  was completed early in theragenics will continue these efforts and may incur research and development expenditures based on these opportunities 
the company is also searching for  reviewing and evaluating external opportunities for diversification such as joint ventures  partnerships  and or additional acquisitions of technologies  products or companies 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
during  unit sales of the theraseed product decreased approximately  while unit sales directly to customers decreased to of total unit sales in from approximately in the average selling price of theraseed decreased from to  which contributing to the overall decrease in revenues because direct to consumer sales are made at higher prices than sales to third party 
the company believes that the decrease in unit sales throughout the year was a combination of several factors including disappointing sales by the company s non exclusive distribution partners and uncertainty related to proposed rules for medicare reimbursement see medicare developments below 
the change in the distribution mix  which led to a decrease in the average selling price  was a result of several factors beginning with the termination of the distribution agreement with indigo medical inc indigo  a johnson and johnson company  in january after the termination of the agreement  theragenics increased its number of direct sales and sales through other non exclusive distributors 
however  theragenics sold to a significant number of former indigo customers while publicly stating that it expected its share of direct theraseed device sales to decline as its other non exclusive distributors began to market aggressively to the former indigo customers 
the percentage of direct to customer sales for theragenics declined from as the non exclusive distributors began aggressively marketing to former indigo customers 
early in  theragenics was notified by one of its non exclusive distributors of its intent to terminate the distribution agreement with theragenics upon completion of an impending acquisition by another theragenics non exclusive distributor of theraseed 
the acquiring distributor represented approximately of total revenue during while the acquiree respresented approximately during the same period 
although the company believes that the acquiring distributor is capable of assuming customers and sales from the acquiree  there is no guarantee that this will occur 
it is difficult to determine at the present time the impact the consolidation will have on future sales of theraseed 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments received for the company s therasphere technology 
such licensing fees are not expected to become material in the foreseeable future 
at any point in time  theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for theraseed in order to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on the prices of theraseed and could have a favorable effect or prevent an unfavorable effect on market share and volumes 
failure to respond to market opportunities and competitive situations in order to maintain per unit pricing could adversely affect current or potential market share and volumes and or result in a decrease in margins 
cost of sales was million during compared to million in gross profit was of revenue in  compared to in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in over was largely due to the considerable fixed cost component of theragenics operations  partially offset by the transfer of material and resources to support research and development initiatives 
in addition  approximately million of operating expenses related to the psp facility were recognized as cost of sales during the second half of  as the facility became operational  including depreciation of approximately selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in general advertising of approximately million in compared to additionally  theragenics incurred higher expenses from increased premiums related to insurance coverage  primarily for directors and officers liability insurance when policies were renewed late in these increases were partially offset a decrease in consulting costs compared to in the company engaged marketing and advertising specialists with experience in health care and direct to consumer marketing  and expects direct to consumer advertising activity to continue at the same rate in the company also expects to continue other activities in an attempt to support its brand name and increase demand for theraseed implants  including advertising to physicians  clinical studies aimed at showing the advantages of theraseed implants in the treatment of prostate cancer  technical field support to theraseed customers  and other customer service and patient information activities 
during a small direct sales force comprising brachytherapy specialists was formed to promote and support the theraseed brand 
also  theragenics made substantial expenditures in to advocate appropriate reimbursement for brachytherapy 
these efforts will continue in see medicare developments below 
r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue in  from million  or of revenue in the company s research and development initiatives are intended to expand the application of pd to other oncological and non oncological uses  and to explore options for using the company s expertise and capabilities in other areas 
the company s r d initiatives in and were related primarily to restenosis studies and age related macular degeneration 
during theragenics was granted an investigational device exemption from the us food and drug administration to initiate its therap therasource pd for the prevention of restenosis clinical trial 
the company began the therap trial  a human clinical feasibility study related to restenosis in peripheral vessels  in early see the overview above 
also  early in  the company completed an animal pilot study using pd in a prototype device for treatment of the wet form of age related macular degeneration and is investigating requirements necessary to proceed toward the implementation of human clinical trials 
the results of the animal pilot study were favorable and in line with expectations 
management plans to continue to increase efforts in r d as its initiatives to diversify move forward  and expects r d expenditures to increase proportionately 
however  r d spending is dependent on the complex scheduling of r d activities in progress as well as the pursuit of other appropriate opportunities as they arise 
accordingly  r d expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
other income  primarily comprising interest income  was million in compared to million in the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
while additional funds were available for investment during  the interest rate environment during reduced the effective returns on a significant portion of the company s investments 
funds available for investment have been and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and r d activities  and may be used for the acquisition of technologies  products or companies consistent with the goals of theragenics 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects other income to fluctuate accordingly 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately for both and the company s income tax rate in each period was lower than statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects  research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
during  theragenics sold approximately of unit sales directly to customers 
in comparison  theragenics sold almost all of its unit sales to third party distributors in because direct to customer sales are made at higher prices than sales to third party distributors  the average selling price of theraseed increased from to even though units sold during decreased from  the higher average selling price caused year over year revenue to increase 
from may to august the company was a party to a sales and marketing agreement with indigo medical  inc  a johnson johnson company  the indigo agreement and indigo  respectively that granted indigo exclusive worldwide marketing rights to theraseed for the treatment of prostate cancer 
in july the company billed indigo million for shortfalls in its purchase minimum requirements  and indigo gave notice of its intention to terminate the agreement 
subsequently  the indigo agreement was terminated effective january  after the termination of the indigo agreement  several customers that had been purchasing from indigo began to purchase directly from theragenics  while many other former indigo customers purchased theraseed from theragenics non exclusive distributors 
as management anticipated  the non exclusive distributors continued to aggressively market to the former indigo customers and the percentage of direct sales of theraseed units  and accordingly  its average revenue per theraseed unit  began to decline 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments received for the company s therasphere technology 
gross profit increased to of revenue in  compared to in however  cost of sales increased from million in to during the increase in cost of sales in over was due to the increase in depreciation and operating costs related to the additional cyclotrons put in operation in salary and related expenses  due to an increase in headcount and employee mix more heavily weighted toward higher technical expertise  also contributed to the increase in cost of sales during selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising  marketing  customer service and cancer information expenses 
prior to september  these expenses were supported by indigo under the terms of the indigo agreement 
additionally  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  compensation and benefits  and start up expenses associated with the company s plasma separation process project the psp project  contributed to the increases during the period 
r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue in  from million  or of revenue in the company s r d initiatives in and related primarily to restenosis studies carried out by the american cardiovascular research institute  and development efforts to improve the company s proprietary production processes 
other r d efforts included the use of pd in treating the wet form of age related macular degeneration 
other income exclusive of the million received from indigo  referred to above  primarily comprising interest income  was million in compared to million in the company s investments consisted primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
while additional funds were available for investment during  the interest rate environment during reduced the effective returns on a significant portion of the company s investments 
the company recognized million of other income in related to purchase minimum shortfalls under the indigo agreement 
this increased net earnings during by million  or per diluted share 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately and for and  respectively 
the increase was a result of a reduction in tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects and research activities during the company s income tax rate in each period is lower than the statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects and research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
subsequent event acquisition subsequent to the year end the company diversified its product line with the purchase of the us iodine prostate brachytherapy business of bebig isotopen und medizintechnik gmbh bebig  formerly distributed by ipl isotope products laboratories  both subsidiaries of a publicly traded german company  eckert ziegler ag 
the purchase gives theragenics exclusive us manufacturing and distribution rights to the iodine based medical device used in the treatment of prostate cancer 
the company also procured an automated production line that is expected to become operational in non exclusive rights to distribute theraseed in europe were granted to bebig as part of the transaction 
the company believes that the ability to provide both palladium and iodine isotopes will provide access to customers and markets not otherwise accessible with either palladium or iodine alone 
the product line and equipment purchase will not affect the company s existing non exclusive distribution agreements for theraseed 
the agreement is not expected to have a significant impact on revenues or net income during critical accounting policies the financial statements of theragenics corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following allowance for doubtful accounts 
management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivables balances may become uncollectible 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  management analyzes accounts receivable in relation to current economic trends and changes in our customer payment history in establishing this allowance 
the accounts receivable balance  net of the provision for this trade accounts receivables allowance of  was approximately million as of december  property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
the company s estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
we currently own and operate cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in each of the company s cyclotrons is depreciated using an estimated year life 
the cyclotrons incorporate a number of proprietary design modifications that render the cyclotrons unique to commercial applications 
management s estimate of the useful life of these cyclotrons is based on the company s experience to date with these cyclotrons 
based on experience gained relative to the operation  repair  refurbishment  and maintenance of the cyclotrons  management believes there is a substantive basis for the current depreciable lives of the cyclotrons 
the doe has granted theragenics access to unique doe technology  known as the psp  for use in production of isotopes  including pd see overview above 
the psp equipment was placed in service during the second half of and is depreciated using an estimated year life 
the psp equipment utilizes specialized  unique technology 
management will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness in relation to the cyclotrons and psp equipment 
if the company determines that the useful life of property  plant or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful life lives of the identified asset s 
recently issued accounting standard 
theragenics has identified retirement obligations associated with the decommissioning of its cyclotrons and related facilities 
management expects the adoption of sfas no 
see notes to the financial statements in will result in an increase to its liabilities of approximately  and a cumulative expense of approximately  before income taxes  and  after income taxes 
annual amortization of the increased asset costs and accretion expense charged to operations is expected to be approximately  before income taxes and approximately  after income taxes 
management is required to use estimates in determining the potential impact of sfas no 
on its financial statements 
factors including the regulatory environment  inflation  alternative uses of the cyclotrons  and new or alternative technologies  among other things  used in determining these estimates may change over time 
therefore  changes in these factors will require the company to reexamine and adjust its anticipated effect of asset retirement obligations accordingly 
the company will implement sfas no 
in liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  short term investments and marketable securities of million at december   compared to million at december  marketable securities consist primarily of high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
the increase in cash  short term investments and marketable securities was a result of cash generated by operations  partially offset by capital expenditures 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  the company also has an unsecured credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for maximum borrowings of million under two lines of credit  and an additional uncommitted million line of credit 
the unsecured credit agreement expires in august letters of credit totaling approximately  were outstanding under the terms of the unsecured credit agreement at december  no other borrowings were outstanding under the unsecured credit agreement as of december  and march  cash generated by operations was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
cash generated from operations consists of net earnings plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and deferred income tax expense and changes in balance sheet items such as accounts receivable  inventories and payables 
as a result of the direct to customer sales and non exclusive distribution agreements  approximately million more of income was in the form of accounts receivable rather than cash  as the company s accounts receivable base changed as a result of its direct to customer sales and non exclusive distribution agreements 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in as a result of the oak ridge facility and psp equipment that was placed in service during the second half of these primary sources of cash from operations and non cash expenses were partially offset by a decrease in net income in compared to the company s primary use of cash in and related to capital spending to increase manufacturing capacity and support diversification efforts 
capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures related primarily to the company s psp project see below 
as part of the psp project  the company has constructed a facility in oak ridge  tennessee to house the equipment  infrastructure and work force intended to support the production of isotopes  including pd  using psp technology 
construction costs of approximately million were incurred on the psp project through december  the project is substantially complete  becoming operational in the second half of no significant revenues were generated from the psp project in early in  theragenics acquired the exclusive us manufacturing and distribution rights to an iodine based medical device for prostate cancer treatment see subsequent event acquisition above 
theragenics has also agreed to acquire an automated production line that is expected to become operational in progress payments will be made to bebig based upon completion of pre defined milestones 
therefore  the timing of all payments and subsequent delivery and operation of the equipment may vary based on milestone completion 
the company expects that r d spending will continue to increase see results of operations  above and or additional funds may be used for the psp project in at this time  routine capital expenditures  and the purchase of the equipment and facility renovations related to the iodine line  are expected to reach approximately million during cash will also be used for increased marketing and theraseed support activities 
cash provided by financing activities was  and  in and  respectively  consisting of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the company believes that current cash and investment balances  cash from future operations and credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  management may choose to raise those funds through other means of financing as appropriate 
medicare developments previously  theragenics theraseed device and other brachytherapy seeds fell within various transitional pass through codes  which were separate from the procedure payment codes that comprise much of medicare s outpatient prospective payment system opps 
on april   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented changes in hospital payments for brachytherapy and other services provided under medicare s opps for the remainder of through december   cms bundled a portion of pass through reimbursement for all brachytherapy seeds and other devices with the associated procedure codes  thereby effectively sheltering seeds from pro rata reductions that would otherwise have applied under current medicare law 
to the extent that these pass through device costs exceeded the bundled amount  the remaining cost was subject to a pro rated reduction in reimbursement 
on november   cms issued its rule for medicare opps reimbursement 
under the new rule  cms bundled the costs of the brachytherapy procedure  as well as the costs for catheters  needles and all seeds  into two new codes for prostate brachytherapy one for palladium and one for iodine 
by creating two codes and setting separate reimbursement amounts in the final rule for palladium seed brachytherapy including the theraseed device and iodine seed brachytherapy  cms made an important  positive change for our theraseed device product compared to its initial proposal published on august  specifically  the per patient amount under the final rule for palladium prostate brachytherapy exceeds the original payment amount proposed in august for both palladium and iodine the per patient amount for palladium prostate brachytherapy also exceeds the payment amount for iodine prostate brachytherapy 
to the extent that the brachytherapy costs exceed the bundled amount  the remaining cost may no longer be submitted for reimbursement 
while medicare reimbursement for brachytherapy continues to create uncertainty for hospitals and doctors  at this time  management is unable to predict the impact of the final rules on future sales 
however  management will be closely monitoring any effects of the new reimbursement structure on the brachytherapy market as it continues to evaluate pricing  marketing and distribution strategies 
theragenics has been pursuing  and will continue to pursue avenues to attempt to address the reimbursement structure set forth by cms 
theragenics is continuing its efforts to assist policymakers in formulating and revising medicare policies to recognize the unique aspects of classification and reimbursement that apply to the theraseed device and recognize its superior characteristics compared to other avenues of treatment 
these efforts include working with policymakers to implement legislation which would create more favorable reimbursement for brachytherapy devices 
also  in the company engaged a consulting firm specializing in reimbursement practices to help communicate brachytherapy reimbursement guidelines to customers
