item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  we are very proud of our performance during the year ended december  it was a year in which we continued a remarkable recovery from the devastating effects of the september th terrorist attacks  while also achieving solid financial results 
our recovery took many forms 
we hired new brokers 
we improved the performance of many of our established businesses and expanded into new business lines 
we selected new permanent headquarters in lower manhattan  at one seaport plaza  and signed a year lease 
we held a charity day on march  that raised million for the euro brokers relief fund  inc we obtained timely cash advances from our insurance carrier throughout the year that provided needed liquidity and then negotiated a final settlement of our september th business interruption insurance claim that ensured the maintenance of our strong financial base 
we improved and expanded the application of our leading technology solutions to our existing and new businesses 
we won a significant litigation in the united kingdom that permitted us to acquire ownership of our london operations at a very favorable purchase price 
we actively managed our capital structure through the elimination of two series of outstanding warrants  which upon exercise raised proceeds of million  and the continuation of our common stock repurchase program 
through it all  the perseverance and hard work of our employees and staff  the strength of the families of our lost employees  and the loyalty and support of our clients lifted and energized us 
working out of sub optimal  temporary headquarters for the entire year  we experienced a remarkable bonding and coming together of the maxcor and euro brokers teams 
their performance during is a testament to their spirit  energy and work ethic  as well as their loyalty to our company and their desire to honor their lost colleagues 
the result is what we ultimately believe to be a stronger company  both financially and emotionally 
our basic financial measures of performance  on a gaap basis  were up across the board in over net income increased by more than  to million  or per share  from million  or per share 
revenues increased  to million from million 
overall stockholders equity jumped almost  to million a per share book value of from million a per share book value of 
continuing the pattern of  much of saw strong levels of trading activity in the fixed income and derivatives markets in which we are active 
we took advantage of these active markets by making judicious new hires and focusing on client service to help us to maintain or increase our market share in key products 
as a result  our euro brokers operations generated improved revenues and performance across many of our brokerage desks in new york 
in particular  we garnered improved revenues from each of our interest rate swaps  interest rate options  us treasury  federal agency and mortgage backed repurchase agreements and federal agency bond desks 
revenues from our cash deposits and money market desks  however  were down from levels  and our emerging market debt businesses continued to have to cope with depressed trading volumes in that sector 
in new york  we launched a new us treasury brokerage desk in august  believing that there was a market opportunity in this area for well focused voice broker services 
we also viewed the desk as nicely complementing a number of our existing businesses 
we believe that the us treasury s financing requirements will continue to increase and we are optimistic that this new business will become successful with improved results in in london  we launched a new credit derivatives desk in on the heels of our late launch of such a desk in new york 
both desks  but london in particular  contributed positively to results in the new york desk suffered near the end of the year as the result of the loss of several key employees  but we have since made replacement hires 
we believe credit derivatives will continue to be a growth area 
our london operations as a whole had a solid and profitable  on a level about equal with that of  while also building what we believe will be a stronger foundation for improved future results 
in addition to the positive results of the credit derivatives desk  we garnered continued strong performance from our interest rate options  us dollar swaps and euro currency swaps desks 
emerging market debt products brokered out of london saw reduced revenues  but still made an overall positive contribution to results 
our tokyo operations continued to struggle during in the midst of an extended downturn in overall derivatives market activity there as a result of extraordinarily low interest rates and very low volatilities 
at the end of  we began implementing an internal restructuring to attack our cost structure 
brokers were migrated from high  guaranteed base salaries to lower base salaries and higher performance based payouts 
we think this revised incentive based structure  which  as of the end of the first quarter in  has been substantially implemented  will protect our downside cost exposure while allowing us to attract new hires and compete favorably in the marketplace until overall economic and trading conditions in tokyo improve 
throughout  in addition to focusing on our core inter dealer brokerage operations  we continued our diversification efforts by expanding our sales and trading operations within our maxcor financial inc broker dealer 
in april  we hired a leveraged finance group to specialize in institutional sales and trading operations in high yield and distressed debt  supplemented by quality research efforts 
we followed this expansion with the launch mid year of an institutional equities sales and trading operation focused on providing top quality service  research and order execution to the money management community 
the equity group s emphasis is on the less actively traded stocks  including small cap stocks  value stocks and real estate investment trusts 
in the fourth quarter  we also started an institutional convertible securities operation  aimed at providing clients with quality execution and arbitrage trading ideas 
the goal in these various new maxcor initiatives  in addition to growth and diversification  has been to establish businesses with institutional clients in which we can offer research  trading strategies and execution services over broad  but underserved  asset classes in a coordinated approach 
all three new groups leveraged finance  equities and convertibles contributed positively to results in we intend to continue to expand our sales and trading operations in  with opportunistic additions when and where we believe we can hire the right people and establish a meaningful presence 
to this end  in late march  we have contributed an additional million in capital to our broker dealer thereby raising its total capital to in excess of million in order to be able to upgrade to dealer membership status with the government securities division of the fixed income clearing corporation 
the new capital is intended primarily to facilitate riskless principal transactions within our sales and trading operations by enhancing our broker dealer s credit status with gsd ficc 
the additional capital is primarily being financed by a new million  secured reducing credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we continued in to allocate a small portion of our existing capital to support principal transactions in which we assume market risk for a period of time 
this trading occurs primarily in our municipal securities and leveraged finance businesses  where we will often hold inventory in anticipation of client needs  but also in our firm investment account 
for  all three of these areas contributed positively to results  with aggregate revenue from trading gains approximately equal to levels  at million 
we expect  however  to incur a significant loss in on our trading contracts in when issued shares of ntl  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
looking forward  we will continue to use some of our existing capital to support various trading and inventory positions  but do not currently envision any significant expansion of that commitment 
on march   the six month anniversary of the terrorist attacks  we held our first annual charity day 
with the full support of our clients and our employees  who waived any entitlement to commissions from the revenues generated that day  we were able to raise slightly over million for our euro brokers relief fund 
we were very proud of these results and will be holding another charity day  to benefit both the fund and our newly established maxcor foundation  in may in may  we won an important lawsuit in london that entitled us to obtain ownership of our non securities brokerage operations in london euro brokers finacor limited by purchasing the shareholdings therein of our partner  monecor london limited  at a discount to the net book value of those holdings  measured as of late december the judgment enforced specific contractual buy out provisions in a shareholders agreement between us and monecor a subsidiary of finacor  which was acquired by viel cie in that were triggered by the failure of monecor  in late  to provide certain requested funding for the london operations 
monecor s appeal of the judgment was dismissed unanimously by a three member panel of the london court of appeals in february the panel also refused monecor s request to appeal further to the house of lords 
as a result  monecor was obligated to transfer its shareholdings to us later that same month  and euro brokers finacor limited then changed its name to euro brokers limited although monecor has subsequently petitioned the house of lords directly for leave to appeal  it is not expected that such leave will be granted or  if granted  that the appeal itself will be successful 
because of the discounted purchase price paid by us for monecor s shareholdings  we will recognize a one time extraordinary gain of approximately million in the first quarter of  which will have the effect of increasing that period s after tax net income by the same amount 
the ownership also means that our future results of operations will no longer exclude the income or loss allocable to monecor s interest 
in  for example  approximately million of income was allocated to this interest 
in august  we signed a lease for new permanent headquarters in new york at one seaport plaza  also known as water street 
the lease  which has an initial duration of slightly over years until december   signifies our long term commitment both to our business and to lower manhattan 
the leased premises are for the entire th and th floors and cover over  rentable square feet  providing us with room to grow over the lease s term 
in connection with signing the lease  we accepted an incentive package offer from new york state and new york city that provides us a with an initial cash grant of million for job retention and up to an additional  in grants for job growth 
payment of the initial grant is expected to be made in april because of contingent recapture provisions associated with the grant in the event of future job losses or relocations  this amount and any additional grants for future growth will only be recognized in earnings over the term of the new lease 
our cash flows were significantly helped by periodic advances we obtained from kemper insurance companies on our business insurance claims relating to the september th terrorist attacks 
in december  we negotiated a final settlement with kemper of our claim under the coverage portion of our policy providing for the recovery of lost revenues net of saved expenses and additional expenditures incurred to restore operations or minimize the period and total cost of disruption to operations 
the settlement of million generated a one time fourth quarter after tax net benefit of million or 
per share  reflecting additional lost income in excess of amounts previously recognized  after application of the proceeds to cover both new and previously charged september th related expenses 
the settlement did not resolve our property insurance claim under a separate policy coverage with kemper providing for  among other things  the full replacement cost of assets destroyed in the attacks 
as of year end  kemper had advanced us million pursuant to this coverage  which has an aggregate limit of approximately million  pending completion and documentation of our total expenditures in connection with our planned move to and build out at one seaport plaza 
when our property claim is fully and finally settled or otherwise resolved  we will record a significant one time gain that  on a pre tax basis  will be equal to the amount by which the total proceeds under the coverage exceed the net  depreciated book value of property destroyed in the attacks which was approximately million 
however  under gaap  such gain will be offset in earnings over time by the required expensing  over their respective useful lives  of the replacement assets purchased with the property insurance proceeds 
in february  we completed our move to one seaport plaza  staggered over the course of three weekends to maintain business continuity 
after more than months in our temporary headquarters  our brokers and other employees were delighted to have a permanent home again  complete with state of the art infrastructure and equipment and optimized desk configurations 
our new premises now house all of our approximately new york based employees and staff 
we used the opportunity of a new build out at one seaport plaza to re think technology applications across all of our desks 
our goals have always been to use technology to provide our brokers with the best tools  manage execution and settlement risks and provide our clients with the highest possible level of service 
as a result  we used our tradesoft r technology to automate further the broker interfaces on many of our desks 
we also expanded the deployment of tradesoft s paperless ticket system  which generates automatic e mail and fax trade confirmations to our clients and provides direct electronic transmission of the trade data to our back office  to more of our businesses 
this deployment has most recently also encompassed our tokyo office as well 
the year also saw the continuation of our common stock repurchase program  as part of our overall effort to manage our capital structure and increase value to stockholders 
in total  we repurchased  shares in  at an aggregate cost of million 
these repurchases helped to offset dilution from warrant and stock option exercises during on april   we permitted the expiration of our two series of outstanding warrants issued in connection with our initial public offering and our acquisition of the euro brokers businesses 
in the period just prior to that expiration   of these warrants were exercised at a price of per share  resulting in the issuance of a like number of shares and raising proceeds for us of approximately million 
option exercises during increased our shares outstanding by a net total of  shares 
repurchases to date in through march  have totaled  shares  leaving us with remaining authorization under our repurchase program for  shares 
as has always been the case  all purchases of shares are subject to the availability of shares at prices which are acceptable to us  as well as to our assessment of prevailing market and business conditions  and  accordingly  there is no guarantee as to the timing or number of shares to be repurchased 
critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements details the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of those statements 
there are certain of these policies that are considered to be of particular importance because they require difficult  complex or subjective judgments on matters that are often inherently uncertain 
the following is a discussion of these policies 
securities and trading contracts are carried at fair values generally based on quoted market prices 
from time to time quoted market prices are not available for certain municipal or other securities positions 
for such securities  we  with the assistance of independent pricing services  determine fair values by analyzing securities with similar characteristics that have quoted market prices 
consideration is given to the size of our individual positions relative to the overall market activity in such positions when determining the impact our sale would have on fair values 
since uncertainties may exist as to the settlement of when issued equity trading contracts  we defer any gains resulting from adjusting the costs of these contracts to fair values until uncertainties relating to settlement are resolved 
the assumptions used in valuing our securities and trading contracts may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reserves for certain contingencies to which we may have exposure  such as the employer portion of national insurance contributions in the uk  interest and claims on securities settlement disputes and reserves for certain income tax contingencies 
the determination of the amounts of these reserves requires significant judgment on our part 
we consider many factors in determining the amount of these reserves  such as legal precedent and case law and historic experience 
the assumptions used in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual costs of resolution of these items could be greater or less than the reserve amount

year ended december  compared to year ended december  commission income represents revenues generated on our brokerage transactions conducted on an agency including name give up or matched riskless principal basis 
for  these revenues increased  to  compared to  for  due to increased brokerage in new york and london 
in new york  the increase principally reflected increased revenues from repurchase agreements  federal agency bonds  credit derivatives and interest rate derivatives  commissions derived from newly started us treasury  leveraged finance and institutional equity departments and reduced amounts in from the disruption to operations following the september th terrorist attacks 
partially offsetting these increases were reduced revenues in emerging market debt and money market instruments and the suspension or discontinuation of certain operations after the september th attacks 
the increase in london reflected the net effects of revenues derived from our newly started credit derivatives department  the currency effect of translating strengthened british pound sterling amounts to us dollars and reduced revenues from emerging market debt 
insurance recoveries for represent the portions of the settlements of claims under us and us business interruption insurance policies for losses incurred in new york and london following the september th attacks attributable to lost revenues net of saved expenses 
the balance of these settlements is recorded as offsets to costs related to world trade center attacks see below 
during we recorded million in insurance recoveries relating to the settlement of our us claim against kemper  representing the million portion of the million total settlement allocated to lost revenues net of saved expenses  less the  amount recorded in also during we recorded an insurance recovery of  pursuant to the uk settlement of million with norwich union  representing the portion of that settlement allocated to lost revenues net of saved expenses 
the  amount recorded in reflected the portion of lost revenues net of saved expenses through september  under our us policy with kemper for which we believed there were no contingencies that would have a material impact 
we anticipate a significant one time gain in for insurance recoveries upon the settlement of our property casualty insurance policy with kemper for the excess of replacement costs over the book values and lease termination costs of assets destroyed in the september th attacks 
such gain will be offset over time in future periods by increases to depreciation and amortization expense of assets held and rental expense for assets leased pursuant to sale leaseback arrangements 
principal transactions represent the net gains generated from our securities transactions that involve the assumption of market risk for a period of time  as well as the results of activities in our firm investment account

clearing and execution fees are fees paid to clearing firms for transactions settlements and credit enhancements and to other broker dealers including ecns for providing access to various markets and exchanges for executing transactions

this gross cost of million million net after applying the portion of insurance proceeds from norwich union allocable to this cost was based upon our estimate of the length of time it will take to generate replacement sublet income on this space and the difference between the amount we believe we will then be able to achieve and our cost associated with the space 
other gross extra expenses incurred during and include additional occupancy costs in new york  the purchase of equipment solely compatible with our temporary facilities in new york  the use of outside professionals  interest on failed securities settlements  recruitment fees and benefits for the families of deceased employees

in march we terminated the facility with gecc and entered into a new facility with the bank of new york bony for a three year revolving credit facility of up to million 
this facility is secured by ebi s billed accounts receivables and the stock issued by ebi to its direct parent and has mandatory reductions to availability of million on each of the eighteenth and thirtieth months following the closing date 
as with the gecc facility  the agreement with bony contains certain covenants  which require ebi separately  and our entire company as a whole  to maintain certain financial ratios and conditions

in the immediate aftermath of the september th attack  the board further expanded this authorization by an additional  shares in order to bring the total authorization up to  shares 
as of december   we had purchased  shares under this expanded program 
as has been the case with each of our repurchase program authorizations  all purchases of shares are subject to the availability of shares at prices which are acceptable to us  as well as to our assessment of prevailing market and business conditions  and  accordingly  there is no guarantee as to the timing or number of shares to be repurchased 
all purchases are anticipated to be funded using our existing resources 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with operating and capital leases and information service contracts

these leases contain options at the end of the terms to purchase the assets at a percentage of their original cost or to return the assets and either pay gecc the amount by which our termination obligation exceeds the proceeds on gecc s disposition of the assets or receive the amount by which the proceeds on gecc s disposition exceeds the cost of our purchase option 
these leases do not meet one or more of the criteria for capital lease treatment and  accordingly  they are classified as operating leases 
the following table sets forth our contractual payment commitments pursuant to these leases

however  to the extent inflation increases certain of our operating expenses  such as employee compensation  travel and entertainment  occupancy and communication costs  such increases may not be readily recoverable in the price of our services  particularly for operations domiciled outside the united states  where there are increased inflationary pressures 
in addition  to the extent inflation increases or decreases volatility in the securities markets  our brokerage business is likely to be affected by corresponding increases or decreases in brokerage transaction volumes

such forward looking statements  which describe our current beliefs concerning future business conditions and the outlook for our company and business  are subject to significant uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
actual results or performance could differ materially from that which we expect 
uncertainties include factors such as market and economic conditions  including the level of trading volumes in the instruments we broker and interest rate volatilities  the effects of any additional terrorist acts or acts of war and governments military and other responses to them  the scope of our recoveries from insurers  the success of our technology development and deployment  the status of our relationships with employees  clients  business partners  vendors and clearing firms  possible third party litigations or regulatory actions against us or other unanticipated contingencies  the scope of our trading gains and losses  the actions of our competitors  and government regulatory changes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are actively involved in the evaluation of risks associated with certain financial instruments and will from time to time reduce other risks inherent in our businesses through the use of financial instruments 
we reduce market risk related to positions in our sales and trading operations by limiting both the size of our overall positions and the number of days positions are held 
we closely monitor our securities positions on a daily basis through a review by management of daily activity and position reports prepared by operations staff 
these reports detail all executed transactions  the resulting commissions and principal gains and losses and the closing positions 
the detail of closing positions includes their cost basis and independently verified market prices 
in the process of executing brokerage transactions  we sometimes experience out trades or other errors in which we may have liability for the resulting unmatched position 
out trades generally increase with increases in the volatility of the market 
if an out trade is promptly discovered  thereby allowing prompt correction or disposition of the unmatched position  our risk is usually limited 
if discovery or correction or disposition is delayed  the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening market movements prior to such correction or disposition 
we believe that both our paperless confirmation system and our electronic blotter system  because of their ability to confirm trade details rapidly and identify unbalanced trade conditions as they occur  serve to help limit the market risk exposure when out trades or other errors occur 
to limit our exposure further in such situations  our policy is to correct or dispose of any resulting unmatched positions promptly after their discovery 
we do not consider our exposure to fixed interest rates significant at december   due to the low level of debt outstanding 
any borrowings under the facility with gecc and in the future with bony bear interest at variable rates 
we will monitor the level of borrowings under the new bony facility as well as the interest rate environment to determine the necessity of a hedging strategy to guard against increases in market interest rates 
the tables below provide information  at each of december  and december   about our financial instruments that are used either for trading purposes or other than trading purposes and that are sensitive to either changes in interest rates or changes in foreign exchange rates
