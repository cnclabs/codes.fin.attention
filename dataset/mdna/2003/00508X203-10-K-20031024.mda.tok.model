item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background actuant corporation is a manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of industrial products and systems  organized as two business segments  tools supplies and engineered solutions 
on july  the company completed a spin off the distribution of its electronics business apw to shareholders 
as you read the following review of the company s financial condition and results of operations  you should also read our financial statements and related notes  which follow the discussion 
results of operations historical financial data year ended august  in millions statements of earnings data net sales gross profit selling  administration  and engineering expenses amortization of intangible assets operating profit other financial data depreciation capital expenditures net sales the following table summarizes our net sales for the past three fiscal years year ended august  in millions net sales by segment tools supplies engineered solutions total net sales net sales change by segment tools supplies engineered solutions total net sales fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales from kopp  which was acquired on september   comprised of the increase

table of contents net sales for the tools supplies segment increased by million or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal kopp comprised of the increase 
excluding the impact of kopp and foreign currency rate changes on translated results  which had a positive impact of million  sales were essentially unchanged with the prior year 
the flat sales reflect lower sales in north america due to weak economic conditions  especially in the commercial construction markets  partially offset by growth in the emerging chinese market and large infrastructure projects in europe 
engineered solutions net sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes on translated results  which had a positive impact of million  sales increased million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was caused by growth in demand in both the truck and convertible top actuation markets offset by decreased recreational vehicle rv market sales due to excess inventory levels held at dealers and the loss of two customers in late fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline is due to the impact of the mox med and qmc divestitures in fiscal and reduced sales in most of the tools supplies distribution channels  offset by approximately million of favorable currency impact on translated results  increased sales to the rv market due to higher demand  and the march  acquisition of dewald 
poor economic conditions in fiscal were exacerbated by the terrorist actions in the united states on september tools supplies net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a million or decrease 
approximately million of the decrease was driven by weaker economic conditions in north america and the negative impact of the september  terrorist actions 
sales in our more capital intensive distribution channels  to the electrical distribution market and to oems declined more than other markets in fiscal the divestiture of qmc in fiscal contributed million to the decline 
engineered solutions net sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is attributable to a increase  or million  in sales to the rv market due to higher demand and the incremental impact of a full year of dewald sales acquired in the middle of fiscal 
these increases were partially offset by the loss of sales due to the august divestiture of mox med 
gross profit the following table summarizes gross profit and gross profit margins for the past three fiscal years year ended august  in millions gross profit by segment tools supplies engineered solutions consolidated gross profit gross profit margins by segment tools supplies 
engineered solutions consolidated gross profit margin 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit in fiscal was million  a million increase over the million reported in fiscal the increase is the result of the kopp acquisition  the impact of currency exchange rates on translated results  and the continued focus on improving manufacturing efficiencies and achieving material cost reductions  offset by continued automotive start up and new model launch activities 
total gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the lower gross profit margins at kopp as compared to the other actuant businesses 
in addition  during fiscal  the company incurred a total of million in downsizing costs  million of which impacted gross profit with the remaining million affecting selling  administrative  and engineering expense 
excluding kopp  gross profit increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  tools supplies gross profit increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase is due to the kopp acquisition  the impact of currency exchange rates on translated results  and the material cost down initiatives discussed earlier 
gross profit margins in tools supplies decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the lower gross profit margins realized by kopp as compared to the rest of the tools supplies segment 
excluding the impact of the kopp acquisition  gross profit margins were essentially unchanged 
the company expects kopp s gross profit margins to improve in fiscal as kopp continues to implement lean manufacturing techniques to reduce costs  simplify the business  shorten cycle time and reduce inventory 
engineered solutions gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase is due to the significant progress that was made on material cost down initiatives and improvements in manufacturing efficiencies in the rv business  offset by initial production costs and inefficiencies with new automotive platforms which began production in fiscal  a start up joint venture in germany  and the opening of a united states automotive plant to support new business 
gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit decreased million  or  from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to reduced sales volumes resulting from the divestitures of mox med and qmc  which contributed million of gross profit in fiscal gross profit margins declined slightly due to the unfavorable mix resulting from the growth in our engineered solutions business and contraction in our tools supplies business 
engineered solutions margins were reduced due to the rv plant consolidation activities  the impact of a full year of dewald s lower margins  and increased engineering development and prototype costs for new convertible top business 
gross margin increases in the tools supplies business were driven by a focused effort to reduce costs 
gross profit decreased million  or  in the tools supplies business  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the divestiture of qmc comprised million of the decrease  with the remainder attributable to reduced tools supplies sales 
gross profit margins  however  improved to in fiscal  from in fiscal significant cost reduction efforts were made in the hydraulic and electrical tools businesses  resulting in material cost reductions  personnel reductions  and facility downsizing 
these cost reductions come in large part from a formal cost reduction program implemented in the tools supplies business in mid fiscal  which was subsequently implemented across all actuant businesses 
engineered solutions fiscal gross profit decreased million  or from fiscal this decrease is comprised of the impact of the divestiture of mox med  offset by gross profit increases resulting from the increased sales to the rv market 
gross profit margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the divestiture of mox med  which had higher margins than the engineered solutions business as a whole  inefficiencies related to the consolidation of our rv manufacturing facilities  lower fixed cost absorption at our more vertically integrated milwaukee cylinder and nielsen sessions operations due to lower sales and production levels as compared to the prior year  and higher prototype costs in the automotive operations to support new platform development

the company s federal income tax return for fiscal year is presently under audit by the internal revenue service irs 
company management believes that adequate reserves are maintained as of august  to cover a reasonable estimate of its potential exposure with respect to the income tax liabilities that may result from such audit 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be sufficient upon completion of the irs audit  and if not  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
at august  the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million for contractual and contingent payments due to the former owners of kopp and for contingent payments related to indemnifications provided to purchasers of sold subsidiaries 
timing of commitments the timing of payments due under the company s commitments is as follows contractual obligations a years ended august  long term debt obligations operating lease obligations kopp deferred purchase price total amounts in s thereafter total a the preceding table excludes the million of payments due to apw or other third parties as distribution related contingencies are resolved and the million acquisition of the kopp minority interest  as the exact timing of these payments are not known 
the company estimates that such payments will be made in fiscal and dividends have not been declared or made during fiscal  nor does the company expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
cash flow will instead be retained for working capital needs  acquisitions  and to reduce outstanding debt 
at august   the company had approximately million of availability under its revolver 
in september  approximately million was used to fund the repurchase of a portion of the notes and million was utilized to acquire kwikee products company  inc see note subsequent events for further information 
as a result  the company had approximately million available under its revolver at september  the company believes that  if needed  additional borrowing capacity could be attained 
the company s senior secured credit facility contains customary limits and restrictions 
table of contents concerning investments  sales of assets  liens on assets  interest and fixed cost coverage ratios  maximum leverage  capital expenditures  acquisitions  excess cash flow  dividends  and other restricted payments 
at august  the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
the company believes that availability under its credit facilities  plus funds generated from operations  will be adequate to meet operating  debt service and capital expenditure requirements 
seasonality and working capital since the distribution  we have met our working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under revolving credit facilities 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
the largest single customer generated approximately of fiscal net sales 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing operations consist of the assembly of components that are sourced from a variety of vendors 
we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended august    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows and borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
for the past three fiscal years  capital expenditures were invested primarily in machinery and equipment and computer systems 
fiscal capital expenditures were higher than the previous two fiscal years due to the continued ramp up in the automotive convertible top business to support the new automotive business won by the company 
fiscal capital expenditures were higher than due to capital spending resulting from the february fire at our plant in oldenzaal  the netherlands and higher spending relating to new automotive production lines to support new convertible top business 
there are no significant capital programs planned in the near future that would require expenditures in excess of fiscal levels 
raw material costs and inflation no meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
however  we believe that the rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations 
we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations

the company adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in the second quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and  to a much lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included within note summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
currency risk the company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
approximately and of our revenues for the year ended august  and  respectively  were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
of those us dollar denominated amounts  approximately and  respectively  were denominated in euro  with the majority of the remainder denominated in various asian and other european currencies 
the company does not expect to hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
the company s identifiable foreign currency exchange exposure results primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and from the repayment of intercompany loans between subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
the company periodically identifies areas where it does not have naturally occurring offsetting positions and then may purchase hedging instruments to protect against anticipated exposures 
there are no such hedging instruments in place as of october  the company s financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables and receivables 
interest rate risk the company has earnings exposure related to interest rate changes on its outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to the libor and euribor interest rates 
the company has periodically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage overall financing costs and interest rate risk 
at august   the company was a party to two interest rate swap agreements 
one of these swap contracts converts million of the company s floating rate debt  issued pursuant to the senior secured credit agreement  to fixed rate debt 
the second swap contract converts million of fixed rate senior subordinated debt to a variable rate 
at august   the aggregate fair value of these contracts was approximately million 
a percent increase or decrease in the applicable interest rates on unhedged variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 

table of contents the company s senior secured credit agreement stipulates that no more than of total debt shall be effectively subject to a floating interest rate at the time an interest rate swap agreement is entered into 
the company is in compliance with this requirement
