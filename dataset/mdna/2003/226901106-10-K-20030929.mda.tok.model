an increase in the number of units shipped and an increase in the average selling price per unit  partially offset by a decrease in accessory sales  contributed to the higher revenue between years 
oem sales in fiscal increased for the fourth consecutive year to  and represented of total sales  compared to  in fiscal the gross profit percentage of realized in fiscal decreased from the generated in the prior year 
the main contributor to the lower margins was  of charges to cost of goods sold to increase the obsolescence reserve for inventory associated with discontinued products that was disposed of in the current year and for potential obsolete inventory that was still in stock at fiscal year end 
these charges represented of net sales in fiscal and more than offset the favorable impact from higher sales that resulted in a better utilization of fixed manufacturing costs when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the charges to cost of goods sold  to increase the obsolescence reserve was recorded in the company s fiscal fourth quarter ended june  in the fourth quarter the company received revised forecasts from two key business partners that significantly reduced the expected demand for two products for which the company maintained large inventories of component parts 
the company also released its new line of anesthesia monitoring products in its fiscal fourth quarter  increasing the risk of obsolescence of component parts maintained for its old line of anesthesia monitoring products 
mainly due to these two events that arose in the fourth quarter  the company increased its reserve for obsolete inventory to million from its  balance at the end of the fiscal third quarter ended march  this increase in the obsolescence reserve in the fourth quarter reduced gross margins to and increased the loss for the fourth quarter to  total operating expenses in fiscal were almost million higher than the prior year and more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales in the current year 
administrative expenses increased  due mainly to legal and consulting fees related to the internal review conducted by the company of its import and export procedures that totaled approximately  also contributing to higher administrative expenses in were a final settlement of  made to the company s former ceo and founder to satisfy past severance obligation issues and  of increased spending on business and health insurance  utilities  and investor related expenses

in fiscal  recoveries of bad debts expensed in prior years more than offset additional provisions expensed  resulting in a credit of bad debt expense of  compared to  of bad debt expense recognized in fiscal in addition  a  increase in combined trade show  travel  and advertising spending to support the rollout of the company s new anesthesia products contributed to the higher sales and marketing expenses in the current year 
research  development  and engineering expenses were up  in the current year over the prior year due mostly to a  increase in combined labor  employee benefits  and project spending costs incurred to launch the company s new line of proprietary anesthesia monitoring products 
total other income was almost million higher in fiscal than the prior year which offset the majority of the increase in operating expenses  resulting in a bottom line net loss of  that was almost  lower than the  net loss in the prior year 
the other income consisted mainly of a  gain recognized on the sale of the company s investment in immtech international  inc   in profit recognized on a medical integration project in romania  and a  gain on the sale of the company s building 
in addition  the company realized an  foreign currency exchange gain in the current year related to the company s operation in india compared to a  foreign currency exchange loss recognized in the prior year 
the company retired its long term bank debt in august by using the proceeds from the sale of the company s facility 
this bank debt retirement caused a reduction in interest expense of  over the prior year and  consequently  contributed to higher other income in the current year over the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  compared to june  net sales of million for the fiscal year ended june  were down from million in fiscal a reduction in the number of units shipped and a decrease in the average selling price per unit were the main contributors to the sales decline between years 
a increase in accessory sales in fiscal partially offset the reduced sales volume and lower average selling prices on the company s monitors and related equipment 
international sales in fiscal to criticare s distributors in the united kingdom uk and china decreased from the prior year and contributed over million to the company s sales decrease between years 
significant cutbacks in health care spending in the uk  where only critically important capital expenditures were being made  negatively impacted the company s sales to its distributor in the uk in fiscal the transition to a new distributor in china in fiscal resulted in reduced sales in fiscal as this change was implemented 
domestic sales in fiscal were down  from the prior year  but this was partially offset by higher sales to domestic oem customers that were up  in fiscal the decrease in domestic sales can be attributed to the poor us economy in fiscal and the events of september th  which basically eliminated sales from one of the company s largest domestic trade shows that was held that week 
oem sales in fiscal increased for the third consecutive year and represented of total company sales in fiscal  consistent with the company s strategy to increase this seg ment of its business 
the gross profit percentage of realized in fiscal was down from in fiscal higher manufacturing costs in the first six months of fiscal to support the company s efforts to transition its manufacturing offshore by the end of calendar year and the lower sales volume between years resulted in an under utilization of fixed manufacturing costs which contributed to reduced margins in fiscal due to the outsourcing of the majority of the company s products  approximately  of fixed costs that had previously been classified as manufacturing expens es were included in administrative expenses in fiscal the favorable impact of this change on margins was offset by a  increase in the reserve for obsolete inventory that was deemed necessary due to continued high levels of component parts being maintained by the company after outsourcing the majority of its manufacturing 
total operating expenses in fiscal were  lower than the prior year  despite a  increase in administrative expenses  due mainly to a  reduction in marketing expenses in fiscal as noted above  the higher administrative expenses were mainly driven by a change in the classification of expenses due to a change in the operations of the business 
certain fixed costs that had been expensed as manufacturing costs in prior years were more appropriately classified as administrative expenses in fiscal the decrease in marketing expenses was due mostly to a reduction in sales commissions and bonuses earned from lower sales in fiscal in addition  the elimination of a sales vice president position in the fourth quarter of the prior year resulted in a reduction in marketing salaries and fringe benefits in fiscal in addition to the lower sales and reduction in gross profit in fiscal  a  increase in other expenses in fiscal  due mostly to the recognition of a  foreign currency exchange loss related to the company s operation in india  contributed to the  loss generated in fiscal critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  sales returns  inventories  and warranty obligations 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies require its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues and the costs of products sold are recognized as the related products are shipped or installed  if there are significant installation costs 
this revenue recognition policy is utilized for shipment of product to customers including both distributors and end users 
revenues for integration contracts where criticare integration acts as an intermediary to supply medical equipment and supplies to medical facilities in countries in the black sea economic zone are recognized on a net basis for services rendered upon completion of the transaction giving rise to the service 
since the activity for these integration services was not material in fiscal  they are included in the accompanying statements of operations as other income 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management analyzes specific accounts receivable as well as historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency movements  and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of any of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company also maintains a sales returns reserve in order to estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  and acceptances of the company s products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns reserve 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the timing of the company s revenue if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
the company maintains a reserve for obsolete inventory that it utilizes to write down inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of the inventory and the estimated market value 
the company determines the adequacy of the obsolescence reserve by considering historical annual usage of component parts and finished goods as well as assumptions about market conditions and forecasted demand 
when items are physically disposed of the amounts are written off against the reserve 
if future product demand is lower than expected or if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional charges to increase the obsolescence reserve may be required 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was increased  to  at june  to provide for potential obsolete inventory associated with discontinued products and excess inventory associated with slow moving parts 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was increased by  to  at june  due to continued high levels of component parts being maintained by the company after outsourcing the majority of its manufacturing 
product warranty the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped based upon its historical experience providing warranty coverage 
the company s warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from current projections  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required
