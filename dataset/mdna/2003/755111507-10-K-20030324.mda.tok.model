item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview raytheon company the company is one of the largest defense electronics contractors in the world  serving all branches of the us military and other us government agencies  nato  and many allied governments 
the company is a leader in defense electronics  including missiles  radar  sensors and electro optics  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance isr  command  control  communication  and information systems  naval systems  air traffic control systems  and technical services 
the company s defense electronics businesses are well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in missile defense  precision engagement  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance  and homeland security 
due to the multi year defense spending cycle  recent increased budget authorizations in these areas are expected to favorably impact the company s defense electronics businesses over the next several years 
raytheon s commercial electronics businesses leverage defense technologies in commercial markets 
raytheon aircraft is a leading provider of business and special mission aircraft and delivers a broad line of jet  turboprop  and piston powered airplanes to corporate and government customers worldwide 
the company continues to see soft demand for new and used aircraft in defense industry considerations few recent developments have altered the defense and security environment of the united states as dramatically as the events of september  in response  the us has committed itself to a long term war on terrorism 
simultaneously  the us must also replenish war materials consumed during operations in afghanistan while also making progress toward secretary rumsfeld s goal of military transformation 
the latest us department of defense budget reflects these three diverse objectives 
military transformation  which had been under review prior to september th  is expected to gain momentum 
secretary rumsfeld is focused on pillars of transformation strengthening joint operations experimenting with new approaches to warfare exploiting us intelligence advantages developing transformational capabilities transformation is focused on meeting the military challenges of the future 
in this new environment  the need for advanced technology and defense electronics is clear 
in order to respond quickly to global threats and protect our forces in theater  the us will have to rely more heavily on intelligence and instantaneous  secure communication 
at the same time  our military must also help defend the homeland against terrorist and missile attack 
the company s strategy is focused on meeting domestic and international customers needs in areas where the company has both experience and technology discriminators 
the company s growth strategy is focused on four strategic business areas missile defense precision engagement intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance homeland security the president has made a commitment to have a us missile defense system operational by the company has a broad array of technology and capabilities in this growing area 
from the company s hit to kill weapons  to radar sensors  to space based infrared sensors  to command and control  the company is positioned to meet the nation s needs 
while the company s position as a leader in missile defense is well recognized  precision engagement is a much broader concept 
it includes the identification and tracking of targets as well as engagement and effectiveness assessment 
the company produces products across the entire engagement chain 
the company s innovative sensing  processing  and dissemination technologies effectively compress the information gap from hours to minutes 
the company s intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance programs cover the full spectrum of information management  providing the ability to task  collect  process  exploit  and disseminate national and tactical target data 
these abilities are crucial for warfighters to achieve information dominance throughout the entire battlespace 
in the area of homeland security  the company has skills  experience  and technology in areas such as airport security  command  control  and communications  and the integration and fusion of sensory inputs for real time decision support 
this is still a new market with significant uncertainty and the ultimate customers and available funding have yet to be determined 
unlike many major defense contractors  the company provides electronics for a wide range of missions and platforms 
the company has several thousand programs 
this reduces some of the risk and volatility often inherent in the defense industry 
the company generally acts as a prime contractor or subcontractor on its programs 
the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional authorization and appropriation 
while congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis  major defense programs are usually conducted under binding contracts over multiple years  which provides a level of continuity uncommon to many industries 
the termination of funding for a us government program could result in a loss of future revenues  which would have a negative effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
us government contracts are generally subject to oversight audits and contain provisions for termination 
failure to comply with us government regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from us government contracting 
sales to the us government may be affected by changes in procurement policies  budget considerations  changing defense requirements  and political developments 
the influence of these factors  which are largely beyond the company s control  could impact the company s operations 
consolidated results of operations net sales were billion in  billion in  and billion in sales to the us department of defense were percent of sales in and percent in and total sales to the us government  including foreign military sales  were percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in international sales  including foreign military sales  were percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in gross margin  net sales less cost of sales  was billion in  billion in  and billion in  or percent of sales in  percent in  and percent in included in gross margin in were charges of million at raytheon aircraft  described below in segment results  and goodwill amortization of million which was discontinued january  in accordance with sfas no

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

this accounting standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets and requires that goodwill amortization be discontinued and replaced with periodic tests of impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill amortization was discontinued as of january  in  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to its former aircraft integration systems business ais as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
due to the non deductibility of this goodwill  the company did not record a tax benefit in connection with this impairment 
also in  the company completed its transitional review for potential goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 whereby the company utilized a market multiple approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units within the defense businesses and allocated goodwill to the defense businesses based upon an estimate of the fair value of the portion of a previously acquired company contribution to the new segment 
the company utilized a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of the commercial business reporting units 
as a result  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million pretax or million after tax  which represented all of the goodwill at raytheon aircraft  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the company also determined that there was no impairment of goodwill related to any of its defense businesses beyond the million related to ais 
the total goodwill impairment charge in was million pretax  million after tax  or per diluted share 
the net loss was million or per diluted share in versus million or per diluted share in and net income of million or per diluted share in excluding the raytheon aircraft charges and goodwill amortization  net income was million or per diluted share in excluding goodwill amortization  net income was million or per diluted share in prior period restructuring initiatives the company essentially completed all prior period restructuring initiatives in except for ongoing idle facility costs

this was a result of continued weakness in the commuter aircraft market and the impact of the events of september  on the commuter airline industry 
during the first half of  the company experienced a significant decrease in the volume of used commuter aircraft sales 
an evaluation of commuter aircraft market conditions and the events of september  indicated that the market weakness would continue into the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company completed an analysis of the estimated fair value of the various models of commuter aircraft and reduced the book value of commuter aircraft inventory and equipment leased to others accordingly 
in addition  the company adjusted the book value of long term receivables and established a reserve for off balance sheet receivables based on the company s estimate of exposures on customer financed assets due to defaults  refinancing  and remarketing of these aircraft

raytheon aircraft company rac manufactures  markets  and supports business jets  turboprops  and piston powered aircraft for the world s commercial  regional airline  fractional ownership  and military aircraft markets 
also beginning in the first quarter of  the company will change the way pension expense or income is reported in the company s segment results 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes  which is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements of pension plans  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued which are determined by other factors 
a major factor for determining pension funding requirements are cost accounting standards cas that proscribe the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on us government contracts 
the company will report the difference between sfas no 
fas pension expense or income and cas pension expense as a separate line item in the company s segment results called fas cas income adjustment 
the company s individual segment results will now only include pension expense as determined under cas  which can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the us government 
previously  the company s individual segment results included fas pension expense or income  which consisted of cas pension expense and an adjustment to reconcile cas pension expense to fas pension expense or income

discontinued operations in  the company sold its aircraft integration systems business ais for  million  net  subject to purchase price adjustments 
the company is currently involved in a purchase price dispute related to the sale of ais 
there was no pretax gain or loss on the sale of ais  however  due to the non deductible goodwill associated with ais  the company recorded a tax provision of million  resulting in a million after tax loss on the sale of ais 
as part of the transaction  the company retained the responsibility for performance of the boeing business jet bbj program 
the company also retained million of bbj related assets  million of receivables and other assets  and rights to a million jury award related to a claim against learjet 
at december   the balance of these retained assets was million 
schedule delays  cost growth  and other variables could continue to have a negative effect on these retained assets 
the timing and amount of net realizable value of these retained assets are uncertain and subject to a number of unpredictable market forces 
in  the company recorded charges related to ais of million  which included a million write down of a bbj related aircraft owned by the company  a million charge for cost growth on one of the two bbj aircraft not yet delivered  and a million 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued charge to write down other bbj related assets to net realizable value  offset by a million gain resulting from the finalization of the claim  described above 
the write down of the bbj related aircraft resulted from the company s decision to market this aircraft unfinished due to the current environment of declining prices for bbj related aircraft 
the company was previously marketing this aircraft as a customized executive bbj 
the write down of other bbj related assets reflects the difficulty the company has been experiencing in liquidating these assets 
in  the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to ais was million 
in and  pretax income from discontinued operations related to ais was million and million  respectively 
in  the company sold its raytheon engineers constructors businesses re c to washington group international  inc wgi for million in cash plus assumption of debt and other obligations 
at the time of the sale  the company had  either directly or through a subsidiary that it still owns  outstanding letters of credit  performance bonds  and parent guarantees of performance and payment the support agreements on many long term construction contracts and certain leases 
the support agreements were provided to customers at the time of contract award as security to the customers for the underlying contract obligations 
often  the total security was capped at the value of the contract price to secure full performance  including  in some cases  the payment of liquidated damages available under the contract 
at december   the maximum exposure on outstanding support agreements for which there were stated values was million for letters of credit  million for performance bonds  and million for parent guarantees 
of these amounts  million of letters of credit and million of performance bonds relate to projects assumed by wgi in its bankruptcy  as described below 
there are additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated maximum value that also remain outstanding 
of the guarantees that have no maximum stated value  many relate to contract obligations that  by their terms  include caps on liability for certain types of obligations  and all of the underlying projects have substantially completed construction and are in the punchlist  warranty  commercial closeout  and claims resolution phase  except the two massachusetts construction projects  described below 
some of these contingent obligations and guarantees include warranty provisions and extend for a number of years 
in connection with the sale of re c  the company was entitled to the financial rewards of certain claims  equity investments  and receivables totaling million that were sold to wgi 
in addition  the company was obligated to indemnify wgi against certain obligations and liabilities totaling million 
as a result of wgi s bankruptcy filing  described below  the realization of these various assets through wgi was no longer probable  however  the obligations and liabilities could be set off against the assets pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement 
in  the company recorded a charge of million to write off these assets and liabilities 
in march  wgi abandoned two massachusetts construction projects  triggering the company s guarantees to the customer 
the company honored the guarantees and commenced work on these projects 
construction and start up activities continue on the two projects the mystic station plant and the fore river plant 
pursuant to the construction contract  since the mystic station plant had not achieved performance test completion by january   the company made payments totaling million  which pre funded the delay and performance liquidated damages to the maximum amount specified by the construction contract 
also pursuant to the construction contract  the customer has taken the position that a similar missed deadline occurred on february  for the fore river plant and that a payment of million was required from the company on that date to pre fund the delay and performance liquidated damages to the maximum amount specified by the construction contract 
the company believes that this february  deadline was incorrect and should have been extended as a result of changes for which the company is entitled to change orders  an issue that is now being arbitrated between the company and the customer 
accordingly  the company did not make the requested payment to the customer on that date and has informed the customer that the deadline and requested payment are in dispute 
as a result  the customer drew down on certain letters of credit totaling million that had been posted by the company as contract performance security 
a resolution of the current dispute between the company and the customer over the contract deadline and the applicable liquidated damages is dependent upon the outcome of the pending arbitration  which should be concluded later this year 
in addition  risks remain in completing the two projects  including costs associated with the possibility of further delays  labor productivity  and the successful completion of required performance tests on the two projects 
in  the company recorded a charge of million resulting from an increase in the estimated cost to complete etc for the two projects 
the company had previously recorded a charge of million in the cost increases have resulted from declining productivity  schedule delays  misestimates of field engineered materials  and unbudgeted hours worked on the two projects 
the company expects to complete construction and performance testing on the two projects and turn them over to the customer during the second quarter of in may  wgi filed for bankruptcy protection 
in the course of the bankruptcy proceeding  wgi rejected some ongoing construction contracts and assumed others 
in january  wgi emerged from bankruptcy and as part of that process  the stock purchase agreement between wgi and the company was terminated and wgi and the company entered into a settlement agreement that provided  among other things  that wgi take reasonable actions to protect the company against future exposure under support agreements related to contracts assumed by wgi and that wgi reimburse the company for any associated costs incurred 
for those contracts rejected by wgi  the company s obligations depend on the extent to which the company has any outstanding support agreements 
the contracts rejected by wgi included four large fixed price international turnkey projects that were close to completion 
construction has been completed on these projects and they are now in the commercial closeout and claims resolution phase 
the company recorded a charge of million in related to warranty and start up costs associated with the last project to be completed 
in  the company recorded a charge of million related to these projects 
the contracts rejected by wgi also included two large construction projects that have been provisionally accepted by the customer red oak and ilijan on which the company had support agreements 
in  the company recorded a charge of million related to final reliability testing and punch list items 
the company also recorded a charge of million resulting from a contract adjustment on one of these projects due to turbine related delays 
in  the company recorded a charge of million related to these and the other wgi construction projects on which the company has support agreements 
risks and exposures on the contracts rejected by wgi include equipment and subcontractor performance  punch list and warranty closeout and performance  schedule and performance liquidated damages  final resolution of contract closeout issues  collection of amounts due under the contracts  potential adverse claims resolution including possible subcontractor claims  lease exposures  availability guarantees  surety bonds  and warranties 
for the contracts assumed by wgi  the company s obligations under existing support agreements would arise if wgi does not meet the obligations that it has assumed 
risks on the contracts assumed by wgi that are subject to support agreements relate to non performance or defaults by wgi 
the company s cost estimates for construction projects are heavily dependent upon third parties  including wgi  and their ability to perform construction management and other tasks that require industry expertise the company no longer possesses 
in addition  there are risks that the ultimate costs to complete and close out the projects will increase beyond the company s current estimates due to factors such as labor productivity and availability of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the impact of change orders  the recoverability of claims included in the etc  and the outcome of defending claims asserted against the company 
there also are claims asserted against the company by vendors  subcontractors  and other project participants that are not beneficiaries of the support agreements 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more of the projects could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in  the company allocated million of interest expense to re c versus million in interest expense was allocated to re c based upon actual cash outflows since the date of disposition

the settlement rate is equal to divided by the average market value of the company s common stock at that time 
the settlement rate cannot be greater than or less than shares of common stock per purchase contract 
using the treasury stock method  there is no effect on the computation of shares for diluted earnings per share if the average market value of the company s common stock is between and per share 
for example  if the company s average stock price during the period was per share  the diluted shares outstanding would increase by million shares or one percent of total shares outstanding at december  at an average stock price of per share  the diluted shares outstanding would increase by million shares  or two percent

to date  space imaging has purchased a significant amount of equipment from its major investors  including the company 
the company s outstanding receivables due from space imaging totaled million at december  space imaging is pursuing its business plan  including assessments relative to future investment in a replacement satellite system and related funding requirements 
space imaging was recently successful in obtaining certain long term commitments from the us government for purchases of commercial satellite imagery 
in order to fund future replacement satellites  space imaging will likely need  but has not yet been able to obtain  commitments for additional funding

the company s investment in and other assets related to the joint venture totaled million at december   which includes equity losses the company has recorded since the formation of the joint venture 
there was approximately million of collateral value underlying amounts due from flight options at december  in addition  there was approximately million of additional transaction related receivables that the company recorded at zero due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of those amounts  due to the fact that the new entity  flight options llc fo  has been unprofitable to date and has not been generating adequate cash flow to finance current operations 
given these operating results  the company has loaned fo an additional million since december  fo had been pursuing additional equity financing  but was not successful in that regard 
as a result  the company offered to exchange the fo debt it currently holds for additional equity in the joint venture  restructure other debt  and invest additional funds for additional equity 
if this restructuring is completed  the company will be responsible for fo s operations  own a majority of fo s stock  and consolidate fo s results in the company s financial statements 
negotiations related to the restructuring are ongoing 
if the company consolidates flight options  it is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  although the company would reduce its reported aircraft backlog by approximately million related to an order received from flight options in in addition  the company s reported revenue  operating income  and other expense would change as a result of the consolidation of flight options results

in late  the company and two of its officers were named as defendants in several class action lawsuits which were consolidated into a single complaint in june  when four additional former or present officers were named as defendants the consolidated complaint 
the consolidated complaint principally alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making misleading statements and by failing to disclose material information concerning the company s financial performance during the class period of october  through october  in march  the court certified the class of plaintiffs as those people who purchased the company s stock between october  and october  in september  the company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss  which the plaintiffs opposed 
the court heard arguments on the motion in february in august  the court issued an order dismissing most of the claims asserted against the company and the individual defendants 
discovery is proceeding on the two circumstances that remain the subject of claims 
in and  the company was also named as a nominal defendant and all of its directors at the time except one were named as defendants in purported derivative lawsuits 
the derivative complaints contain allegations similar to those included in the consolidated complaint and further allege that the defendants breached fiduciary duties to the company and allegedly failed to exercise due care and diligence in the management and administration of the affairs of the company 
in december  the company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss one of the derivative lawsuits 
these actions have since been consolidated  and the plaintiffs have filed a consolidated amended complaint 
the defendants have advised the court that they intend to file a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint 
in june  a purported class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of all purchasers of common stock or senior notes of wgi during the class period of april  through march  the wgi complaint 
the plaintiff class claims to have suffered harm by purchasing wgi securities because the company and certain of its officers allegedly violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting the true financial condition of re c in order to sell re c to wgi at an artificially inflated price 
an amended complaint was filed in october alleging similar claims 
the company and the individual defendants filed a motion seeking to dismiss the action in november in april  the motion to dismiss was denied 
the defendants have filed their answer to the amended complaint and discovery is proceeding 
in july  the company was named as a nominal defendant and all of its directors at the time have been named as defendants in two identical purported derivative lawsuits 
the derivative complaints contain allegations similar to those included in the wgi complaint and further allege that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties to the company and failed to maintain systems necessary for prudent management and control of the company s operations 
in december  the company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss one of the derivative lawsuits 
also in july  the company was named as a nominal defendant and members of its board of directors and several current and former officers have been named as defendants in another purported shareholder derivative action which contains allegations similar to those included in the wgi complaint and further alleges that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties to the company and failed to maintain systems necessary for prudent management and control of the company s operations 
in june  the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
in september  the plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice so that it can be re filed in another jurisdiction 
although the company believes that it and the other defendants have meritorious defenses to each and all of the aforementioned class action and derivative complaints and intends to contest each lawsuit vigorously  an adverse resolution of any of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations in the period in which the lawsuits are resolved 
the company is not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses  if any  related to any of the lawsuits 
in addition  various claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against the company 
while the ultimate liability from these proceedings is presently indeterminable  any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites 
the company s estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is million 
on a discounted basis  the company estimates the liability to be million before us government recovery and has accrued this amount at december  a portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the us government 
the recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the us government is considered probable based on the company s long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs 
accordingly  the company has recorded million at december  for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the us government  which is included in contracts in process 
due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies  the uncertainty of insurance coverage  and the unresolved extent of the company s responsibility  it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters  however  any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

discontinued operations consist of letters of credit  performance bonds  and parent guarantees of performance and payment on certain long term construction contracts  described above in discontinued operations  however  additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no maximum stated value also remain outstanding 
off balance sheet financing arrangements the following amounts were outstanding under the company s off balance sheet receivables facilities at december in millions aircraft receivables facility government receivables facility total the company provides long term financing to its aircraft customers and maintained a program under which an indirect subsidiary of the company sold general aviation and commuter aircraft long term receivables to raytheon aircraft receivables corporation rarc  a special purpose entity 
rarc sold undivided interests in the receivables to a bank syndicate and other financial institutions that purchased these interests for cash under a receivables purchase facility the aircraft receivables facility 
the purchasers had a first priority claim on all proceeds  including the underlying aircraft and any insurance proceeds  and had recourse against the company  at varying percentages  depending upon the character of the receivables sold 
since the aircraft receivables facility no longer provided any real economic benefit  the company bought out the receivables that remained in this facility in  eliminating the cost of maintaining it  and brought the related assets onto the company s books 
the million balance in this facility at december  represented a remaining security interest in certain aircraft whose title had not yet been transferred back to the company 
in  the company entered into a million property sale and five year operating lease synthetic lease facility 
under this lease facility property  plant  and equipment was sold and leased back in order to diversify the company s sources of funding and extend the term of a portion of the company s financing obligations 
in  the company is required to buy back the assets remaining in the lease facility for million 
remaining lease payments under the lease facility at december  total million in critical accounting policies the company has identified the following accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the company believes its judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate 
sales under long term contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs and funding 
cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor  material  warranty  and overhead 
some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets which are recognized in the contract estimates when deemed realizable 
contract change orders and claims are included in sales when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
due to the long term nature of many of the company s programs  developing the estimates of costs and funding often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include labor productivity and availability of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the impact of change orders  availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the recoverability of claims included in any estimate to complete 
in   and  operating income as a percent of net sales for the company s defense businesses did not vary by more than percent 
if the aggregate combined cost estimates for all of the contracts in the company s defense businesses had been higher or lower by percent in  the company s operating income would have changed by approximately million to million 
as described above in discontinued operations  the company s cost estimates for construction projects are heavily dependent upon third parties and their ability to perform construction management and other tasks that require industry expertise the company no longer possesses 
identified risks related to the two massachusetts construction projects  also described above in discontinued operations  include the possibility of further delays  reduced labor productivity  and the timely successful completion of required performance tests on the two projects 
historically  the company has experienced problems associated with these identified risks 
the current schedule calls for the successful completion of the performance tests at the mystic station plant in april and may and the fore river plant in may if the company is unable to meet these dates  the costs on these projects could increase materially 
the current estimate also assumes the recovery of pre funded liquidated damages totaling million related to these two projects 
while the company expects to recover these pre funded liquidated damages from the customer  failure to do so would require an additional charge equal to the amount of pre funded liquidated damages the company is unable to recover 
the company uses lot accounting for new aircraft introductions 
lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to ship and measuring an average cost over the entire lot for each aircraft sold 
the costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average cost of all aircraft expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
once production costs stabilize  which is expected by the time the initial lot has been completed  the use of lot accounting is discontinued 
the selection of lot size is a critical judgment 
the company determines lot size based on several factors  including the size of firm backlog  the expected annual production on the aircraft  and experience on 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued similar new aircraft 
the size of the initial lot for the beechcraft premier i  the only aircraft the company is currently utilizing lot accounting for  is units 
the estimated average cost of the aircraft is reviewed and reassessed quarterly and changes in estimates are recognized over future deliveries remaining in the lot  however  the company is not currently recording profit on aircraft sales in the initial lot 
a percent increase in the estimated cost to produce the aircraft would reduce the company s operating income by approximately million 
the valuation of used aircraft in inventories  which are stated at the lower of cost or market  requires significant judgment 
as part of its assessment of fair value  the company must evaluate many factors including current market conditions  future market conditions  the age and condition of the aircraft  and availability levels for the aircraft in the market 
a percent decrease in the aggregate market value of used aircraft in inventory at december  would result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  upon indication of possible impairment  by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows 
when an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
the determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment  the estimation of future cash flows  and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 
in addition  the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
in connection with the reorganization of the company s government and defense businesses  described above in segment reorganization  the company reallocated goodwill to the newly formed segments based upon an estimate of the fair value of the portion of a previously acquired company contribution to the new segment and performed an initial goodwill impairment test 
the company estimated the fair value of the new segments using a discounted cash flow model based on the company s most recent five year plan and compared the estimated fair value to the net book value of the segment  including goodwill 
there was no indication of goodwill impairment as a result of this initial test 
preparation of forecasts for use in the five year plan involves significant judgments 
changes in these forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company s segments and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
the company has pension and retirement plans covering the majority of its employees  including certain employees in foreign countries 
the selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 
involves significant judgment 
the investment performance of the company s pension plan assets for the year ended october   the measurement date for the company s pension plans  of did not meet the company s long term return on asset roa assumption under sfas no 
of per annum 
due to changes in the extended outlook of the investment markets  the company has reduced the long term roa assumption to 
the company s long term roa assumption is based on target asset allocations of equities with a expected return  fixed income with a expected return  and other including real estate  venture capital  and cash with an expected return 
current allocations are within of the target for each category 
in addition  due to changes in the interest rate environment  the company has reduced the discount rate to from 
as a result  the company s sfas no 
pension expense is expected to be approximately million in and million in if the company adjusts both the long term roa assumption and the discount rate for up or down by basis points  the company s sfas no 
pension expense would change by approximately million 
in selecting the long term roa and discount rate  which are considered to be the key variables in determining pension expense or income  the company considers both current market conditions and expected future market trends  including changes in interest rates and equity market performance 
the company currently estimates that cash contributions to the pension plans will be approximately million in and million in accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no
