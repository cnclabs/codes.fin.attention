item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on december   we announced that we had entered into agreements to sell two of our stations  kplr tv serving the st 
louis marketplace and kwbp tv  serving the portland  oregon marketplace  to subsidiaries of tribune company for an aggregate  all cash  consideration of million plus a payment for the closing date working capital subject to adjustment of the st 
louis station 
we completed these transactions on march  the results relating to these two stations have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the nine television stations that comprise our continuing operations are regionally diverse and range in market size based on television households from through in the nation 
all but one of our stations are affiliates of the wb television network 
our second station in the albuquerque santa fe marketplace is a upn affiliate 
our nine stations have only been on the air  or achieving measurable ratings  for years 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national advertisers 
our revenues depend on popular programming that attracts audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  allowing us to sell advertising time at satisfactory rates 
our revenues also depend significantly on factors such as the national and local economy and the level of local competition 
our revenues are generally highest during the fourth quarter of each year  primarily due to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season consumer spending and an increase in viewership during this period 
we generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and to national sales representatives on national advertising 
our revenues reflect deductions from gross revenues for commissions payable to advertising agencies and national sales representatives 
our primary ongoing operating expenses are programming costs  employee compensation  advertising and promotion expenditures and depreciation and amortization 
programming expense consists primarily of amortization of broadcast rights relating to syndicated programs as well as costs associated with our morning news show  the daily buzz  music rights fees and sports rights fees 
changes in employee compensation expense result primarily from increases in total staffing levels  from adjustments to fixed salaries based on individual performance and inflation and from changes in sales commissions paid to our sales staff based on levels of advertising revenues 
advertising and 
table of contents promotion expenses consist primarily of media and related production costs resulting from the promotion of our stations and programs 
this amount is net of any reimbursement received or due to us for such advertisement and promotion from the wb network  upn or from other program suppliers 
in the fall of  we began to experience a noticeable slowdown in non political advertiser demand 
by december  it was clear that there was a dramatic weakness in demand affecting all media related companies and there were broader indications that the us economy was in a slowdown 
this slack demand continued through all of  and the resultant effect of the events of september  only made a tough year worse 
by industry accounts  television revenues declined approximately over  the steepest decline in the last years 
nearly every publicly traded television broadcaster  including the company  posted year over year declines in advertising revenues 
advertising demand began to rebound early in and by the end of the year  aided by robust political advertising demand in most markets  year over year gains in most of our markets averaged approximately 
although television advertising revenues grew in over  and early market audits seem to indicate that this growth trend has continued  the current iraqi conflict and an uncertain national economic environment provides little visibility as to the health of the advertising marketplace in general  and the eight marketplaces that we serve in particular 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  these revenue gains reflect primarily our ratings gains over the past year along with modest market revenue gains during on a same station basis  excluding the results of our madison acquisition in  our revenues increased 
station operating expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s operating expenses of million 
this increase of was attributable primarily to our continued investment in programming  including our september launch of a new three hour morning news show  the daily buzz  increases in our sales related costs and new expenses related to our roll out of digital transmission services at most of our stations 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million compared to million for this million decrease reflects the cessation of the amortization of intangible assets effective january  in connection with our implementation of sfas no 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
corporate expenses for increased to million from million in this increase in corporate expenses was due primarily to increased incentive compensation expense  professional fees and increased directors and officers insurance costs

interest expense for the current year was million compared to million for this million increase in interest expense is the result of increasing principal balances arising from continued amortization of original issuance discounts on our acme television subsidiary s senior discount notes due the television notes  which began accruing cash interest on october   and our acme intermediate subsidiary s senior secured discount notes due the intermediate notes  which began accruing cash interest on october  in addition  during we incurred higher interest charges on our senior credit facility  which was undrawn during  but which was drawn upon in to fund interest payments on the television notes and capital expenditures in excess of operating cash flow 

table of contents we incurred a tax expense of million in compared to a tax benefit of million in the tax expense in relates primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance required as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of the difference in the statutory federal rate of and the company s effective tax benefit of relates to the impact of non deductible expenses 
our negative broadcast cash flow for was million  compared to a million negative broadcast cash flow in this decrease in negative broadcast cash flow reflects the revenue gains achieved by our stations exceeding our increase in station operating expenses compared to our income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to million for calendar this increased income relates primarily to a reduction in amortization of intangibles as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 partially offset by an increase in our tax expense of discontinued operations 
our net loss for was million as compared with the million loss incurred in  an increase of million 
this increase in our net loss is primarily the result of the one time deferred tax expense recorded in resulting from the impact of sfas no 
and increased interest expense  partially offset by improved operating results and reduced amortization of intangible assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase reflects modest revenue gains at our stations driven by increased ratings and market shares despite double digit declines in advertising market revenues in most of our markets 
station operating expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s operating expenses of million 
this increase was due primarily to increased programming expenses and increased sales expenses relating primarily to nielsen ratings services  net of reduced promotion expenses and incentive compensation expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in this increase relates to increased depreciation on the significant capital expenditures placed into service during and corporate expenses for increased to million from million in this increase relates primarily to increased professional fees incurred in connection with potential strategic transactions and increased directors and officers insurance expense  net of a reduction in incentive compensation expense 
equity based compensation was  for both and and relates to options granted below market value in to senior management in exchange for the termination of their participation in the company s previously established long term incentive plan

the difference in the statutory federal rate of and the company s effective tax benefit of for and for relates to the impact of non deductible expenses 
our negative broadcast cash flow for was million  compared to a million negative broadcast cash flow in this increase in negative broadcast cash flow is primarily attributable to the increased station operating expenses in excess of only modest revenue gains  and therefore lower margins at most of our stations 

table of contents our income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to million for calendar this decreased income relates primarily to a decline in revenues at our discontinued stations which in turn relates to the downturn in advertising demand in these markets 
our net loss for was million as compared with the million loss incurred in  an increase of million 
this increase in our net loss is primarily the result of the decrease in our net income from discontinued operations and increased interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for  an increase in use of cash of million 
the increased use was primarily due to an increase in working capital needs as receivables built at the end of on strengthening ad sales 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the million increase relates primarily to our purchase of our madison station  net of reduced capital expectation 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the increase relates primarily to our borrowings to fund our madison acquisition and increased capital expenditures relating to our digital build out 
the company has carried a high debt level since the issuance of its television notes and its intermediate notes in september these notes were issued at an original discount 
the television notes began accruing cash interest on october  and the first semi annual interest payment of million was made on march  the intermediate notes began accruing cash interest on october  and the initial semi annual interest payment of million will be made on march  as of december   the balance under the company s senior revolving credit facility was approximately million 
the company was in compliance with the covenants of all of our credit agreements as of december  at december   the company had million of cash  million of which is restricted to collateralize capital lease obligations  and working capital of million 
although we generated positive annual operating cash flow from our combined continuing and discontinued broadcast operations  before considering interest payments  since our inception in  the weak advertising environment in resulted in our first ever decline in such cash flow 
on december   we announced that we had entered into agreements to sell our stations kplr tv  serving the st 
louis marketplace  and kwbp tv  serving the portland  oregon marketplace  to subsidiaries of tribune company the tribune transaction for million in an all cash transaction 
the proceeds from these transactions  which closed on march   will be substantially used to repay much of the company s debt 
on march   we repaid all balances owing under our senior credit facility  issued redemption notices for all of our million television notes at the call price of and issued a partial redemption notice for million of our million intermediate notes at the call price of 
the redemption date for both issues is set for april  following the redemption  we will have million outstanding of the intermediate notes 
our semi annual interest payment on the intermediate notes will be reduced to million with the next payment due september  at december   amounts due under all capital lease facilities was million bearing an implicit average interest rate of per annum 
we expect to incur approximately million in additional capital expenditures in  primarily related to our upgrade of our transmission facilities at wbuw in madison and  to a lesser extent  the routine capital expenditures at our other eight television stations 
until such time as we amend  restructure or replace our current senior credit agreement  we have no borrowings available under that facility 
the company s remaining nine television stations will generate significantly reduced broadcast cash flow without the discontinued operations  but the company s debt level and related interest expense will have been substantially reduced 
the company believes that the remaining proceeds from the tribune transaction  after repayment of the senior credit facility and redemption of the television notes and million of intermediate notes  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash requirements for its existing operations for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to either amend  restructure or replace our senior credit facility during the second quarter of we are also in discussions to secure a capital lease line to finance our ongoing and future capital equipment expenditures 
the company expects that any future acquisitions and related capital expenditures of television stations  including any of the four construction permits  would be financed through these same sources and  if necessary  through additional debt and equity financings 
although we believe it would be a secondary alternative  we 
table of contents also have the ability to sell select stations in the event of unforeseen credit difficulties  such as might be experienced if there were further declines in the us economy or in advertising demand 
there is no guarantee that such other means of raising capital will be at terms acceptable to the company  and accordingly current stockholders could be adversely affected by such financings 
certain factors that may effect future results and financial condition 
table of contents the following factors could have a material and adverse impact on the company s business the developmental nature of our continuing stations poses risks to stockholders  including the following we have not generated positive operating cash flow from our continuing operations and the future performance of the company will depend upon our ability to continue increasing our ratings and revenues in a relatively healthy advertising environment  our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions might be impeded  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and our ability to withstand competitive pressures is limited 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from advertisers in diverse industries 
if a number of our advertisers continue to reduce their expenditures because of the current or a future general economic downturn  or an economic downturn in one or more industries or regions  or for any other reason  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not meet our interest obligations under either our intermediate note indenture or an amended  restructured or new senior revolving credit facility  or if we otherwise default under these instruments  our debt may be accelerated under these instruments as well as other debt instruments we have 
in addition  because we of our leverage  we may be less able to respond to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow under an amended  restructured or new revolving credit agreement to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations or delay or forego acquisitions 
these alternative strategies would likely not be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our intermediate note indenture contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  merge  consolidate or sell assets  make acquisitions or investments  or change the nature of our business 
we expect that an amended  restructured or new senior credit facility will be completed during the second quarter of and that it will require us to maintain certain financial covenants 
if we fail to meet some or all of the covenants contained in this facility  we may not be able to borrow under the facility which might adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions as planned or meet general or extraordinary capital needs 
we have incurred net losses in each of our fiscal years since inception and expect to continue to experience net losses in the foreseeable future 
these net losses have principally been the result of interest expense on our outstanding debt and non cash charges for depreciation expense related to fixed assets 
our plans to acquire additional television stations during the past several years have been adversely affected by our increased leverage resulting from a decline in our broadcast cash flow and the related constraints in borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
although we will have significantly reduced our debt through the sale of our discontinued operations  we will still likely need to borrow under a senior credit facility to successfully execute and implement additional station acquisitions 
our inability to secure such a credit facility could limit our future growth 

table of contents furthermore  our ability to acquire additional television stations is affected by the following many competing acquirers have greater resources available to make such acquisitions than we have  desired stations might not be available for purchase  we might be unable to obtain the wb network affiliation for all of the stations we acquire  we might not have the financial resources necessary to acquire additional stations  we might be unable to obtain fcc approval of the assignments or transfers of control of fcc licenses  and current fcc rules limit the number of television broadcasting properties that any one person or entity  including its affiliates  may own in any given market which could limit our ability to pursue desired stations 
generally when we sign acquisition agreements  we enter into interim local marketing agreements with the seller under which we receive some or all of station revenues and pay proportionate station expenses 
because the seller retains ultimate programming control  we bear the economic risks of paying station expenses until closing the acquisition 
mr 
kellner s consulting agreement provides that he may perform services for other businesses unaffiliated with ours that  in certain limited circumstances  may be competitive 
because of mr 
kellner s experience in the television broadcast industry  if mr 
kellner provides services to a competing business  it could materially affect our operations 
mr 
kellner s position at the wb network could create conflicts with his position with us if our interests differ from those of the wb network 
because mr 
kellner is both our chief executive officer and the wb network s chief executive officer  the wb network requires that he recuse himself from any material transaction between the wb network and us 
additionally  due to his responsibilities with the wb network  mr 
kellner continues to have limited time available to devote to us 
all of our continuing television stations are relatively new in their markets and are still developing 
many of them have never generated positive broadcast cash flow and the group  as a whole  has never generated positive broadcast cash flow 
our ability to service our debt and stay in compliance with any credit agreements or indentures is ultimately dependent on our generating positive broadcast cash flow 
emerging technologies that allow viewers to digitally record and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower our advertising revenues 
the required conversion of the broadcast industry to provide digitally transmitted television signals has required us to make significant capital expenditures which  in the short term  will not be balanced by consumer demand for digital television 
while the fcc required all broadcasters to provide a digitally transmitted signal by may  several of our stations received extensions from the fcc 
we expect all of our stations to be transmitting digitally by the end of furthermore  the fcc requires that all stations stop using analog signals on the stations by as of year end  digital television sets are present in less than of us television households  and accordingly  we are unable to predict the extent of consumer demand for digital television will be or when that demand will arise 
contractual cash obligations our contractual cash obligations  including the repayment of our revolving credit facility  the redemption of our television notes and the partial redemption of our intermediate notes  by year of payment  are as follows 
table of contents total interest on programming capital operating contractual long term long term rights lease lease cash debt debt obligations obligations obligations obligations year in thousands thereafter total includes revolving credit facility  television notes and intermediate notes and the redemption premiums on the television notes and million of the intermediate notes 
includes interest on the television notes and million of the intermediate notes through april  redemption date 
excludes obligations of discontinued operations 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  the company expects that its capital expenditures for  which are primarily related to our upgrade of transmission facilities for our madison station and conversion to digital broadcasting as required by the fcc  will be approximately million for our continuing stations

the disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statements ending after december  we do not have any guarantees that require disclosure under fin fin also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
fin requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of a guarantee  which is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements
