these policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
management bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of judgments and estimates form the basis for making judgments about the company s value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements

 revenue recognition in financial statements

inventory valuation reserves

the company also provides reserves for inventory that is not in conformance with customer product specifications 
in both cases  the reserve requirement is estimated based upon a review of specific inventory items

some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projections of cash flows on a non discounted basis 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
fair value is determined based on market quotes  if available  or is based on valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment by applying a fair value based test on an annual basis

achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions

this discussion of potential risks and uncertainties is by no means complete but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the financial company s business and condition 
other sections of this form k may include additional factors which could adversely effect the company s business and financial performance 
moreover  the company operates in a competitive environment 
new risks emerge from time to time and it is not always possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on the company s business or to which any factor or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  shareowners should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results
