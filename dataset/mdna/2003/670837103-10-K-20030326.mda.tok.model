item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
after a review of enogex s assets on the basis of their strategic value and other factors  the company sold all of its exploration and production assets and its interest in belvan corp  belvan limited partnership and todd ranch limited partnership belvan in and its interest in the nustar joint venture nustar in february these dispositions have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
on august   ozark entered into an agreement of sale and purchase with centerpoint energy gas transmission co 
to sell approximately miles of transmission lines of the ozark pipeline located in pittsburg and latimer counties in oklahoma 
on november   the company received ferc approval for the closing  which occurred on january  on january   enogex entered into an agreement of sale and purchase with benedum gas partners  lp to sell all of its interest in nustar 
the effective date of the sale was january  and the closing occurred on february  in october  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on certain issues covered in eitf no 
 issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
one consensus of eitf requires that all mark to market gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on financial derivative contracts as defined in sfas no 
be shown net in the income statement for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december   with reclassification required for prior periods presented 
the company has adopted this consensus effective january  and the application of this consensus did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations as this consensus supports the company s historical presentation of financial derivative contracts 
in october  the eitf reached a consensus to rescind eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  as amended effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  effective october   all new contracts and physical inventories that would have been accounted for under eitf are no longer marked to market through earnings unless the contracts meet the definition of derivative under sfas no 
application of the consensus for energy contracts and inventory that existed on or before october  that remain in effect at the date this consensus is initially applied will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
as a result  only energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative in sfas no 
will be carried at fair value 
the company has adopted this consensus effective january  resulting in an approximate million after tax loss 
the loss  which will be accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  is primarily related to natural gas held in storage for trading purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  enogex recognized a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million 
the impairment loss related to natural gas processing and compression assets 
the impairments resulted from plans to dispose of these assets at prices below the carrying amount 
the fair value of these assets was determined based on third party evaluations  prices for similar assets  historical data and projected cash flows 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
ferc section rate case in december  enogex made its filing at the ferc under section of the natural gas policy act to establish rates and a default processing fee and to address various other issues  for the combined enogex and transok pipeline systems effective january  effective january   these systems began operating as a single enogex pipeline system 
the ferc staff  enogex and the active intervening parties have conducted settlement discussions 
enogex has negotiated a settlement of the case with the interveners 
a stipulation and agreement of settlement and related documents were filed with the ferc on march  to resolve all issues in dispute in docket no 
pr comments are due march  and reply comments will be due april  the proposed settlement includes a fee for processing to bring gas gathered behind processing plants to pipeline gas quality btu standards processing fee and a monthly low flow meter charge of offset in any month by the transportation revenues generated by gas through the meter 
if the settlement is approved  enogex will have no refund obligation 
the outcome of this rate case will not have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations as any default processing fee billed through february has been fully reserved on the company s books 
the company expects to be charging a default processing fee this year and to recognize such fees in the income statement 
transportation and storage general 
one of enogex s primary lines of business is the transportation of natural gas  with current throughput of approximately billion cubic feet per day bcfd 
enogex delivers natural gas to most interstate and intrastate pipelines and end users connected to its systems from the arkoma basin of eastern oklahoma and arkansas  the anadarko basin of western oklahoma and the panhandle of west texas 
at december   enogex was connected to other major pipelines at approximately pipeline interconnect points 
these interconnections include panhandle eastern pipe line  southern star central gas pipeline formerly williams central  natural gas pipeline company of america  oneok gas transmission  northern natural gas company  anr pipeline  western farmers electric cooperative and centerpoint energy gas transmission co  as well as connections via enogex s ozark system to texas eastern and mississippi river transmission 
further  enogex is connected to various end users including much of the natural gas generation facilities in oklahoma 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s transportation and storage business was approximately million 
enogex owns two storage facilities in oklahoma  the greasy creek facility and the stuart storage facility 
the greasy creek facility has a working capacity of approximately billion cubic feet bcf with a maximum daily deliverability of million cubic feet per day mmcfd and similar injection capability 
enogex offers both firm and interruptible storage services to third parties  under section of the natural gas policy act ngpa  under terms and conditions specified in its statement of conditions for gas storage and at market based rates to be negotiated with each customer 
during  enogex expensed approximately million for gas losses associated with the greasy creek storage field 
while gas losses are normally associated with the operation of a natural gas storage field  this amount exceeds normal allowances 
enogex is currently analyzing the field and is taking actions to mitigate future losses 
enogex also recently purchased the stuart storage facility from central oklahoma oil and gas corp 
coog 
the stuart storage facility has a working capacity of approximately bcf 
the stuart storage facility is used exclusively to support enogex s intrastate transportation and storage services for og e 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the pending litigation associated with the purchase of the stuart storage facility 
enogex offers both firm and interruptible transportation services to customers with a majority of transportation revenues derived from firm contracts 
enogex offers interruptible service to customers when capacity is available 
effective january   the enogex and transok llc and its subsidiaries transok pipeline systems have been merged to simplify for both enogex and its customers the administration and operation of maintaining two separate pipelines 
enogex provides firm intrastate transportation services to og e as well as public service company of oklahoma pso  the second largest electric utility in oklahoma  serving the tulsa market 
in july  enogex acquired transok 
transok maintained a sole supplier relationship with pso until  when oklahoma natural gas began supplying gas to three of the pso generating stations pursuant to a competitive bid process put in place by the occ 
notwithstanding the loss of the sole supplier status  enogex remains as the primary supplier to pso 
enogex continues to provide gas transmission delivery services to all of pso s gas fueled electric generation units in oklahoma under a firm intrastate transportation contract 
the current pso contract  which expires january   and the og e contract  which expires april   provide for a monthly demand charge plus a variable transportation rate 
in addition  enogex provides transportation services via the leased palo duro pipeline system to houston pipe line company hpc  an affiliate of pso  for gas delivery service to certain hpc generating stations in the texas panhandle 
the lease for the palo duro pipeline terminates on june  unless enogex exercises its option to renew the lease for an additional five year period 
enogex continues to evaluate the option to renew the lease but has not made any decision in that regard 
during  and  enogex s revenues from the contracts with og e  pso and hpc were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
relationship with og e 
from its inception  enogex has been the exclusive transporter of natural gas to og e electric power generating stations 
although enogex is not directly regulated by the occ  og e s rates are subject to occ jurisdiction 
the occ issued an order on november  which contained a provision  among other things  that og e would consider competitive bidding as an option in obtaining gas transportation service for its natural gas generating facilities when enogex s current contract expires in april the amount collected from og e by enogex under the current contract was approximately million  million and million  respectively  during  and  respectively 
competition 
enogex s pipeline and storage assets compete with interstate and other intrastate pipeline and storage facilities in the transportation and storage of natural gas 
the principal elements of competition are rates  terms of services and flexibility and reliability of service 
natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to enogex s customers and end users  including electricity  coal and fuel oils 
the primary competitive factor is price 
changes in the availability or price of natural gas or other forms of energy as well as weather and other factors affect the demand for natural gas on the enogex system 
regulation 
the rates charged by enogex for transporting natural gas on behalf of an interstate natural gas pipeline company or a local distribution company served by an interstate natural gas pipeline company are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under section of the ngpa 
rates to provide such service must be fair and equitable under the ngpa and are subject to review and approval by the ferc at least once every three years 
this rate review may involve an administrative type trial and an administrative appellate review 
by offering interruptible section transportation  the regulatory burden on enogex is not appreciably increased  but does give enogex the opportunity to utilize any unused capacity on an interruptible basis in interstate commerce and thus increase its transportation revenues 
see ferc section case for a discussion of enogex s current section case 
as noted above  ozark as an interstate pipeline is regulated by the ferc under the natural gas act of  as amended the natural gas act 
the company  through enogex  owns a percent interest in ozark 
ozark transports natural gas in interstate commerce 
as a result  it qualifies as a natural gas company under the natural gas act  and is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the ferc 
under the natural gas act  the ferc has jurisdiction to review and authorize the proposed construction of facilities for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  the rendition of service through interstate facilities  the rates charged for such service  and the abandonment of such facilities or of services 
the natural gas act requires that the rates charged  and the terms and conditions of service observed  by interstate pipelines be just and reasonable  and not unduly discriminatory or preferential 
all rates and terms and conditions of service proposed by an interstate pipeline must be filed with the ferc  and the ferc has jurisdiction under the natural gas act to determine whether proposed rates or terms and conditions meet the statutory standards 
the act confers upon the ferc authority to determine a jurisdictional pipeline s rates  charges and terms and conditions of service  to establish depreciation rates and to prescribe uniform systems of accounts 
the rates charged by enogex for transporting natural gas for og e and other shippers within oklahoma are not subject to ferc regulation because they are intrastate transactions 
with respect to state regulation  the rates charged by enogex for any intrastate transportation service have not been subject to direct state regulation by the occ  which is the state agency responsible for setting rates of public utilities within oklahoma 
even though the intrastate pipeline business of enogex is not directly regulated by the occ  the occ  the arkansas commission and the ferc all of which approve various electric rates of og e have the authority to examine the appropriateness of any transportation charges or other fees paid by og e to enogex which og e seeks to recover from its ratepayers in its cost of service for electric service 
see relationship with og e below for a discussion of competitive bidding for og e s service 
enogex s pipeline operations are subject to various oklahoma safety and environmental and non discriminatory transportation requirements 
gathering and processing general 
natural gas gathering operations are conducted through enogex gas gathering llc  and gas processing operations are conducted through enogex products corporation products 
the streams of processable natural gas gathered from wells and other sources are gathered through enogex s gas gathering systems to processing plants for the extraction of natural gas liquids 
products is one of the largest gas processors in the state of oklahoma  owning gas processing plants of which seven are currently being operated with an inlet capacity of over one bcfd 
during  products had ownership interests in two other gas processing plants related to nustar  which were sold in february in  it produced approximately eight million gross barrels of natural gas liquids 
products has been active since in the processing of natural gas and marketing of natural gas liquids 
products natural gas processing plant operations consist of the extraction and sale of natural gas liquids 
the products extracted include condensate  marketable ethane  condensate  marketable ethane  propane  butanes and natural gasoline mix 
the residue gas remaining after the liquid products have been extracted consists primarily of ethane and methane 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s gathering and processing business was approximately million 
approximately percent of the commercial grade propane processed at products plants is sold on the local market 
the other natural gas liquids produced by products are delivered into pipeline facilities of koch hydrocarbon and transported to conway  kansas and mont belvieu  texas  where they are sold under contract or on the spot market 
ethane  which may be optionally produced at all of products plants except one  is sold in the spot market under a contract with equistar chemicals lp 
during  enogex took steps to decrease the volatility of its earnings stream by reducing its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements 
keep whole processing arrangements generally require a processor of natural gas to keep its shippers whole on a btu basis and  thereby replacing the btu value of the liquids with natural gas at market prices 
therefore  if natural gas prices increase and liquids prices do not increase by a corresponding amount  processing margins are negatively affected 
in order to minimize the negative impact on processing margins  ethane and propane are rejected whenever possible 
exposure to keep whole processing arrangements was reduced through contract renegotiations and changes in the standards of service provided by enogex under the ferc section filing discussed previously that provides for a processing fee in the event the fractionation spreads are negative 
as a result of these actions  exposure to keep whole processing arrangements without the processing fee provision has been reduced to approximately percent of total inlet volumes projected in the remaining projected inlet volumes are approximately percent keep whole with the processing fee  percent liquids and nine percent fixed fee 
in addition  the company actively monitors current and future prices for opportunities to hedge the processing margin 
enogex has executed physical and financial hedges by selling liquids forward as well as hedging the fractionation spread of various liquids components 
as of march   enogex had hedged approximately percent of its projected equity liquid volumes attributable to percentage of liquids agreements and approximately percent of its projected keep whole processing volumes 
after a review of enogex s assets on the basis of their strategic value and other factors  the company sold all of its interest in belvan in and its interest in nustar in february these dispositions have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations for a further discussion 
competition 
in processing and marketing natural gas liquids  products competes against virtually all other gas processors producing and selling natural gas liquids 
competition for natural gas supply is based on efficiency and reliability of operations  reputation  availability of gathering and transportation to markets and pricing arrangements offered by the gatherer processor 
products believes it will be able to continue to compete against such companies 
with respect to the profitability of the natural gas liquids industry generally  as the price of natural gas liquids fall without a corresponding decrease in the price of natural gas  it may become uneconomical to extract certain natural gas liquids 
as explained under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  this factor had a significant adverse impact on the results of enogex during in addition to the commodity pricing impact that affects the entire industry  the profitability of products is also largely affected by the volume of natural gas processed at its plants which is highly dependent upon the volume of natural gas gathered by the enogex pipeline systems 
generally  if the volume of natural gas gathered increases  then the volume of liquids extracted by products should also increase 
marketing and trading enogex s commodity sales and services related to natural gas and electric power are conducted by enogex primarily through its subsidiary  oge energy resources  inc oeri 
natural gas 
oeri is engaged in the business of gas marketing 
oeri s agreements with enogex provide for oeri to provide marketing services for all natural gas volumes purchased by the pipeline at the wellhead from producers or otherwise 
as a service to the producers on the enogex system  enogex may agree to purchase the gas at the wellhead in conjunction with gathering their gas for transportation to other markets 
oeri also purchases and sells natural gas pursuant to contracts with enogex and products relating to enogex s pipeline gathering  processing and storage assets 
oeri marketed the natural gas produced by enogex exploration corporation exploration prior to the sale of exploration s assets 
in  oeri purchased gas for og e 
however  this was discontinued in and at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s marketing and trading business was approximately million 
oeri focuses on serving customers along the natural gas value chain  from producers to end users  by purchasing natural gas from suppliers both on and off the enogex and ozark pipeline systems and reselling to pipelines  local distribution companies and end users  including the electric generation sector 
the geographic scope of marketing efforts has been focused largely in the mid continent area of the united states 
these markets are natural extensions of oeri s business on the enogex system 
oeri contracts for enogex pipeline capacity to access multiple interconnections with the interstate pipeline system that moves natural gas from the production basins in the south central united states to the major consumption areas in chicago  new york and other north central and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
oeri participates in both long term markets and short term spot markets for natural gas 
although oeri continues to increase its focus on long term sales  short term sales of natural gas will continue to play a critical role in the overall strategy because they provide an important source of market intelligence as well as an important portfolio balancing function 
in  oeri bought and sold approximately bcfd of natural gas  of which approximately percent moved on the enogex pipeline system 
oeri s risk management skills afford its customers the opportunity to tailor the risk profile and composition of their natural gas portfolio 
the company follows a policy of hedging price risk on gas purchases or sales contracts entered into by the marketing group by buying and selling natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange futures exchange and other derivatives in the over the counter market  subject to a million annual trading loss limit in accordance with corporate policies 
electricity 
oeri participates actively as a wholesale purchaser and reseller in the physical wholesale power markets of the mid continent region 
it has a fully staffed hour power desk that continually monitors the physical marketplace seeking to capture arbitrage opportunities by matching market participants with power surpluses to those market participants with power needs  primarily on an hourly or daily basis 
oeri no longer participates in any speculative electricity trading activities 
the expertise of oeri s power desk in managing customer requirements and the complexities of the transmission grid provide oeri the opportunity to extract value from the daily marketplace 
as the physical power broker for og e  oeri assists in the sale to and purchase from the physical power markets as required to meet the needs of og e 
in accordance with applicable ferc affiliate rules  since march  virtually all of og e s surplus power sales activity has been performed by oeri who sold approximately  mw s per day in competition 
marketing and trading competes with major integrated oil companies  major interstate and intrastate pipelines  national and local natural gas brokers  marketers and distributors for natural gas supplies and in marketing and trading natural gas 
competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on reputation  the availability of gathering and transportation to high demand markets and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for the producer s natural gas 
competition for sales to customers is based primarily upon reliability  services offered and price of delivered natural gas 
for the year ended december   approximately percent of oeri s service volumes were with electric utilities  local gas distribution companies  pipelines and producers 
the remaining percent of service volumes were to marketers  municipals  cooperatives and industrials 
as of december   approximately percent of the exposure was to companies having investment grade ratings with standard poor s ratings services standard poor s and approximately percent having less than investment grade ratings 
the remaining percent of oeri s exposure is with privately held companies  municipals or cooperative that were not rated by standard poor s 
these non rated companies have satisfied our internal credit analyses and policies 
exploration and production after a review of enogex s assets on the basis of their strategic value and other factors  the company sold all of its exploration and production assets in these dispositions have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
the exploration and production activities were conducted through exploration  which was formed in primarily to engage in the development and production of oil and natural gas 
exploration focused its early drilling activity in the antrim devonian shale trend in the state of michigan and in recent years had concentrated on drilling opportunities in oklahoma

n a not applicable variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation which includes the operating lease obligations for og e s railcar leases shown above and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component included in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
accordingly  while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of unconditional purchase obligations of og e noted above may increase capital requirements  such costs are recoverable through automatic fuel adjustment clauses and have little  if any  impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc also have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays to enogex 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
the company s primary needs for capital are related to replacing or expanding existing facilities in og e s electric utility business and replacing or expanding existing facilities at enogex 
other capital requirements are primarily related to maturing debt  operating lease obligations  hedging activities  natural gas storage and delays in recovering unconditional purchase obligations 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings and permanent financings 
enogex retired million of long term debt that matured or was redeemed in with internally generated funds  funds from the sale of assets and short term debt 
the amounts shown in the chart on page do not include the cost of acquiring an electric generating plant with at least mw of capacity  which og e intends to acquire during in accordance with the settlement agreement approved by the occ on november  any generating facility acquired by og e is expected to be financed through the issuance of common stock by the company and through the issuance of debt by og e 
the company s to construction program does not include the building of any additional generating units 
instead  in accordance with the settlement agreement approved by the occ on november   og e intends to purchase an electric generating plant with at least mw s of generating capacity 
the company believes that an efficient combined cycle plant can be purchased for a price less than the cost to build a new facility 
to reliably meet the increased electricity needs of og e s customers during the foreseeable future  og e will continue to invest to maintain the integrity of the delivery system 
approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
apart from the funds required to purchase at least mw s of a power plant pursuant to the settlement agreement  management expects that internally generated funds will be adequate over the next three years to meet other anticipated capital expenditures  operating needs  payment of dividends and maturities of long term debt 
short term borrowings will be used to meet working capital requirements 
the following table shows the company s lines of credit in place at march  short term borrowings will consist of a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper 
lines of credit in millions entity amount maturity oge energy corp 
a april  january  january  og e june  total a the lines of credit at oge energy corp 
were used to back up the company s commercial paper borrowings  which were approximately million at march  no borrowings were outstanding at march  under any of the lines of credit shown above 
the company s ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a commercial paper ratings downgrade 
the lines of credit contain ratings triggers that require annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if the company suffers an adverse ratings impact 
the impact of a downgrade of the company s rating would result in an increase in the cost of short term borrowings of approximately five to basis points  but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the ratings triggers 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future capital requirements for potential financing needs upon a downgrade by moody s investors service of enogex s long term debt rating 
also contributing to the liquidity of the company have been numerous asset sales by enogex 
since january   completed sales generated proceeds of approximately million 
sales proceeds generated to date have been used to reduce debt at enogex and commercial paper at the holding company 
unlike the company and enogex  og e must obtain regulatory approval from the ferc in order to borrow on a short term basis 
og e has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of assets that may complement its existing portfolio 
permanent financing would be required for any such acquisitions 
environmental matters approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the company s management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with present federal  state and local environmental standards 
it is estimated that the company s total expenditures for capital  operating  maintenance and other costs to preserve and enhance environmental quality will be approximately million during  compared to approximately million utilized in the company continues to evaluate its environmental management systems to ensure compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and to better position itself in a competitive market 
several pieces of national legislation were introduced in requiring the reduction in emission of sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxide nox  carbon dioxide co and mercury from the electric utility industry 
among those was president bush s clear skies proposal 
while not addressing co  this bill would require significant reductions in so  nox and mercury emissions 
none of the proposed legislation became law  however  it is expected that numerous multi pollutant bills will again be introduced in as required by title iv of the clean air act amendments of caaa  og e completed installation and certification of all required continuous emissions monitors at its generating stations in since then og e has submitted emissions data quarterly to the environmental protection agency epa as required by the caaa 
beginning in  og e became subject to more stringent so emission requirements 
these lower limits had no significant financial impact due to og e s earlier decision to burn low sulfur coal 
in  og e s so emissions were well below the allowable limits 
with respect to the nox regulations of title iv of the caaa  og e committed to meeting a lbs mmbtu nox emission level in on all coal fired boilers 
as a result  og e was eligible to exercise its option to extend the effective date of the lower emission requirements from the year until og e s average nox emissions from its coal fired boilers for was lbs mmbtu 
however  further reductions in nox emissions could be required if  among other things  proposed legislation is enacted requiring further reductions  a study currently being conducted by the state of oklahoma determines that such nox emissions are contributing to regional haze  if it is determined by the state of oklahoma that og e s facilities impact the air quality of the tulsa or oklahoma city metropolitan areas or if oklahoma fails to meet the new fine particulate standards 
any of these scenarios would require significant capital and operating expenditures 
the oklahoma department of environmental quality s clean air act amendment title v permitting program was approved by the epa in march by march of  og e had submitted all required permit applications 
as of december   og e had received title v permits for all but one of its generating stations 
since og e submitted all of its permit applications on time it is considered in compliance with the title v permit program even though all permits have not been issued 
air permit fees for generating stations were approximately million in due to an increase in fee amounts by the oklahoma department of environmental quality odeq the fees for are estimated to be approximately million 
other potential air regulations have emerged that could impact og e 
on december   the epa announced its decision to regulate mercury emissions from coal fired boilers 
limits on the amount of mercury emitted are expected to be finalized by december  although full compliance by og e is not expected to be required until depending upon the final regulations implemented  this could result in significant capital and operating expenditures 
in  the epa finalized revisions to the ambient ozone and particulate standards 
after a court challenge  which delayed implementation  the epa has now begun to finalize the implementation process 
based on the most recent monitoring data  it appears that the tulsa metropolitan area will fail to meet the revised standard 
however  tulsa has entered into an early action compact with the epa whereby voluntary measures will be enacted to reduce ozone and thus delay any official non attainment designation 
while the oklahoma city metropolitan area is near non attainment  it appears it will be able to comply without any additional measures 
the epa has indicated that emission sources in muskogee county in oklahoma should be considered in any evaluation of the air quality for the tulsa metropolitan area 
if this occurs  nox reduction at og e s muskogee generation station could be required 
the epa also has issued regulations concerning regional haze 
these regulations are intended to protect visibility in national parks and wilderness areas throughout the united states 
in oklahoma  the wichita mountains would be the only area covered under the regulation 
sulfates and nitrate aerosols both emitted from coal fired boilers can lead to the degradation of visibility 
under these regulations  it is possible that controls on emission sources hundreds of miles away from the affected area may be required 
the state of oklahoma has begun the process of determining what  if any  impact emission sources in oklahoma have on national parks and wilderness areas 
if an impact is determined  then significant capital expenditures could be required for both the sooner and muskogee generating stations 
while the united states has withdrawn its support of the kyoto protocol on global warming  legislation has been drafted which would limit co emissions 
president bush supports voluntary reductions by industry 
og e has joined other utilities in voluntary co sequestration projects through reforestation of land in the southern united states 
in addition  og e has committed to reduce its co emission rate lbs 
co mwh by up to five percent over the next years 
however  if legislation is passed requiring mandatory reductions this could have a tremendous impact on og e s operations by requiring og e to significantly reduce the use of coal as a fuel source 
og e has and will continue to seek new pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction  reuse and recycling efforts 
in  og e obtained refunds of approximately million from its recycling efforts 
this figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials 
similar savings are anticipated in future years 
og e has submitted one application during and will submit three more during to renew its oklahoma pollution discharge elimination system permits 
og e anticipates that the renewed permits will continue to allow operational flexibility 
og e requested  based on the performance of a site specific study  that the state agency responsible for the development of water quality standards wqs adjust the in stream copper criterion at one of its facilities 
without adjustment of this criterion  the facility could be subjected to costly treatment and or facility reconfiguration requirements 
the state has approved the wqs including the adjusted criterion and has transmitted the revised wqs to the epa for their review and approval 
section b of the clean water act requires that the location  design  construction and capacity of any cooling water intake structure reflect the best available technology for minimizing environmental impacts 
the epa s original rules on this issue were set aside in by the fourth circuit us court of appeals 
in  the epa announced its plan to develop new rules in part due to a lawsuit filed by the hudson riverkeeper 
to settle the lawsuit  the epa signed a court approved consent decree to develop b regulations on an agreed upon schedule 
proposed rules  for existing utility sources  were published in and the final rules are expected to be promulgated in august depending on the content of the final rules  capital and operating expenses may increase at most of og e s generating facilities 
increased capital costs may be necessary to retrofit and or redesign existing intake structures to comply with any new b regulations 
the construction and operation of pipelines  plants and other facilities for transporting  gathering  processing  treating or storing natural gas and other products may be subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at the locations at which enogex operates 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or solid waste management measures 
appropriate governmental authorities may enforce these laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures  including monetary penalties  assessment and remediation requirements and injunctions as to future compliance 
enogex generates some materials subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and the clean water act and comparable state statutes  prepares and files reports and documents pursuant to the toxic substance control act and the emergency planning and community right to know act and obtains permits pursuant to the federal clean air act and comparable state air statutes 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  design  initial installation and operation of enogex s facilities 
historically  enogex s total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its results of operations or financial condition 
the company believes  however  that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue to be towards stricter standards 
beginning in  the company began a process to evaluate  determine and report emissions from its pipeline facilities for compliance with recently promulgated maximum achievable control technology regulations 
after evaluating the submitted information  the odeq  in late  issued notices of violation regarding potential air permitting issues at certain of these reported facilities 
generally  the notices alleged violations relating to the potential to emit various emission sources with the majority of the sources relating to glycol dehydrators 
in compliance with consent orders entered between the parties  the company has taken action to submit or modify permits  install control equipment  modify reporting procedures and pay penalties

after evaluating the submitted information  the odeq  in late  issued notices of violation nov regarding potential air permitting issues at certain enogex or transok facilities 
generally  the nov s alleged violations relating to the potential to emit various emission sources with the majority of the sources relating to glycol dehydrators 
as reported in the company s form k  one of the nov s was previously resolved 
all but two of the remaining nov s relating to eight facilities were resolved by consent orders entered in that provided for enogex to submit modify permits  install control equipment  modify reporting procedures and pay penalties of approximately million to the odeq 
enogex continues to work with and exchange information with the odeq regarding two remaining nov sites  the clinton gas plant and the strong city compressor station

enogex has responded with information challenging the allegations and the fine proposed 
two additional nov s relating to air permitting issues have been issued by odeq in november and january  respectively  relating to the cox city compressor station and the comanche tap gas plant 
enogex is in the process of responding to the odeq on these matters and no specific actions or penalties have been proposed

og e entered into an agreement with the parent company of coog  an unrelated third party  to develop a natural gas storage facility the stuart storage facility 
during  og e completed negotiations and contracted with coog for gas storage service 
pursuant to the contract  coog reimbursed og e for all outstanding cash advances and interest of approximately million 
in  coog obtained permanent financing for the stuart storage facility and issued a note the coog note  originally in the amount of million 
in connection with the permanent financing  the company entered into a note purchase agreement  where it agreed  upon the occurrence of a monetary default by coog on its permanent financing  to purchase coog s note from the holders at a price equal to the unpaid principal and interest under the coog note 
in  enogex entered into a storage lease agreement the agreement with coog 
under the agreement  coog agreed to make certain enhancements to the stuart storage facility to increase capacity and deliverability to a level specified and guaranteed by coog 
the agreement was accounted for as a capital lease  and an asset was recorded for approximately million  which was being amortized over years 
as part of the agreement  the company agreed to make up to a million secured loan to natural gas storage corporation ngsc  an affiliate of coog the ngsc loan 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the ngsc loan was approximately million plus accrued interest 
the ngsc loan was originally repayable in and was secured by the assets and stock of coog 
as of july   approximately a million obligation remained on the balance sheet of enogex for the capital lease  which was being amortized 
due to actions taken by the parties  as explained below  the outstanding balance on the ngsc loan has now been offset against the capital lease obligation recorded on the books of enogex 
after the completion of the enhancements by coog in  enogex disputed whether the required and guaranteed level of natural gas deliverability for the stuart storage facility was being provided by coog and these issues were submitted to arbitration in october and november in july  the oklahoma district court affirmed the arbitration award the arbitration award and entered judgment against coog and in favor of enogex in the amount of approximately million the judgment 
the judgment is now final 
on july   enogex exercised the asset purchase option specified in the agreement and specified a closing date of july  coog failed and refused to close on july  the option price as of the closing date was calculated to be approximately million  which was set off against the judgment 
the operation of the stuart storage facility was turned over to enogex by coog on august  by letter dated may   coog advised the holder of the coog note that the arbitration award was in excess of million and  in the event the arbitration award became a final  non appealable order  it would constitute an event of default under the loan agreement relating to the note and that it was unable to make the payment of principal and interest on the note due may  as a result  the company made the may principal and interest payment on the coog note of approximately million and was required to purchase the note on august  at a price equal to its unpaid principal  interest and fees of approximately million 
as the holder of the note  the company is a secured creditor  with a first mortgage or comparable security interest on all of the stuart storage facility 
as a result of the events discussed above  the company recorded a note payable and an asset for approximately million 
the assumption of this note was included in the purchase price for the stuart storage facility on the balance sheet of enogex 
by letter dated june   the company notified ngsc that the ngsc loan was in default and  as a result  all amounts were immediately due and payable under the ngsc loan 
ngsc has failed and refused to repay the ngsc loan 
the company intends to continue to vigorously pursue its rights in conjunction with the ngsc loan 
on august   the company was improperly served with an original petition in a legal proceeding that has been filed by coog and ngsc against the company and enogex in texas 
enogex was properly served on august  coog and ngsc have stated a claim for declaratory judgment asserting  among other things  that ngsc is not obligated to make payments on the ngsc loan based on various theories and  that the company was obligated to demand enogex make the requisite payments to the company  the company is liable to ngsc for failing to demand the requisite payments from enogex  or alternatively  ngsc is entitled to a reduction in the amount it owes to the company  enogex was and is obligated to make the payments to the company until the indebtedness of ngsc to the company is reduced to zero  enogex is not entitled to set off the judgment against the lease payments that it originally owed to coog and now owes to the company  no event of default has occurred  and under the agreement  the only remedy enogex had or has if the stuart storage facility did not perform was to seek a modification of the lease payments based upon coog s expert s analysis of the performance of the stuart storage facility 
coog and ngsc have also stated claims for breach of contract relating to the same allegations in its claim for declatory relief and include claims for attorneys fees 
the company filed a special appearance and original answer subject to its special appearance objecting to being sued in texas because the texas court does not have proper jurisdiction over the company 
on september   enogex filed an original answer in response to the allegations  asserting  among other things  that the disputed issues have already been properly determined by the arbitration panel and the oklahoma court and  therefore  this action is improper 
on october   ngsc filed  in the texas action  an application for temporary injunction seeking to stop enogex from proceeding against ngsc in the oklahoma court 
on october   the texas court held a hearing on ngsc s application for temporary injunction 
without ordering the parties to mediate  the court did direct the parties to mediation 
on october   mediation was held by the parties 
an agreement  which provided several successive steps toward a potential settlement  was signed at that time 
under the agreement  coog transferred full and complete title to the stuart storage facility to enogex effective august  pursuant to the settlement agreement  all litigation between the parties was stayed for days 
the agreement also required coog to have completed certain items within days  or by december  coog failed to do or complete the required items and therefore the stay of the execution of the judgment is no longer in place 
the company intends to continue to vigorously pursue its rights in conjunction with the judgment and payment of the ngsc loan 
farmland industries  inc farmland voluntarily filed for chapter bankruptcy protection from creditors on may  enogex provided gas transportation and supply services to farmland  and is an unsecured creditor of farmland

based on this claim  the city alleges damages in excess of  the city claims that some of enogex s pipelines are located within the city s public rights of way  and therefore  based on city ordinance  any sale of natural gas by enogex to the ipp is subject to a two percent gross receipts tax 
the city makes an identical claim against two other defendants  exelon generation company  llc  exelon as the supplier of natural gas to the ipp and the ipp  green country energy  llc 
the city is also seeking interest on the amount in controversy  as well as its court costs and attorneys fees

in  enogex entered into long term firm transportation contracts with an ipp relating to a plant to be built in wagoner county  oklahoma 
effective july   the contracts were assigned to calpine energy services  lp calpine energy 
in february  enogex requested a prepayment from calpine energy due to calpine falling below the contractual creditworthiness provisions of the transportation contracts 
calpine energy refused to pay for the full monthly demand fees pursuant to the transportation contracts on grounds of an alleged force majeure event 
enogex also made a demand on calpine corporation  as guarantor  relating to calpine energy s failure to make the required prepayment and demand payments 
as of december   the amount of demand revenues due to enogex was approximately million  which amount has been fully reserved on the company s financial statements 
enogex asserts that the remaining demand payments are due for all periods since march  enogex also asserts that calpine corporation is liable for the amounts due and owing under the transportation agreements pursuant to the guarantee executed by calpine corporation  the parent corporation 
calpine energy and calpine corporation filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma relating to the dispute in september calpine energy seeks a declaratory judgment that demand charges are not due and owing and that enogex had no reasonable ground to question its creditworthiness under the contracts 
enogex answered and filed a counterclaim on october  enogex denied that either of the calpine entities was entitled to the declaratory judgment requested and sought  under the counterclaim  an award based on breach of the contracts and the guarantee 
enogex also seeks a declaration that damages are due and owing under the contracts and the guarantee and a two month prepayment should be awarded and maintained until the contractual creditworthiness provisions are met 
for the months of november to february  calpine has paid the full monthly demand fee amounts 
og e has been sued by kaiser francis oil company in district court  blaine county  oklahoma 
this case has been pending for more than ten years 
plaintiff alleges that og e breached the terms of numerous contracts covering approximately wells by failing to purchase gas from plaintiff in amounts set forth in the contracts 
plaintiff seeks million in take or pay damages and million in underpayment damages 
over the objection and unsuccessful appeal by og e  plaintiff has been permitted to amend its petition to include a claim based on theories of tort 
specifically  plaintiff alleges  among other things  that og e intentionally and tortuously interfered with contracts by falsifying documents  sponsoring false testimony and putting forward legal defenses  which are known by og e to be without merit 
if successful  plaintiff believes that these theories could give plaintiff a basis to seek punitive damages 
og e believes that  to the extent plaintiff were successful on the merits of its claims of og e s failure to take gas  these amounts would be recoverable through its regulated electric rates 
the claims related to tortuous conduct  which og e believes at this time are without merit  would not appear to be properly recoverable in its rates 
while the company cannot predict the precise outcome of this lawsuit  the company believes  based on the information known at this time  that this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in the normal course of business  the company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims made by third parties  environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies 
management consults with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if in management s opinion  the company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management  after consultation with legal counsel  does not anticipate that liabilities arising out of other currently pending or threatened lawsuits and claims will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

company strategy in early  the company completed a review of its business strategy that was largely driven by the anticipated deregulation of the retail electric markets in oklahoma and arkansas 
due to a variety of factors  including the current efforts to repeal the oklahoma electric restructuring act of and the recent repeal of the restructuring law in arkansas  the company does not anticipate that deregulation of the electricity markets in oklahoma or arkansas will occur in the foreseeable future 
the strategic direction of the company has been revised to reflect these developments 
as a result  the company expects potentially slower earnings growth than associated with deregulation but with less variability of those earnings 
the company s business strategy will utilize the diversified asset position of og e and enogex to provide energy products and services to customers primarily in the south central united states 
the company will focus on those products and services with limited or manageable commodity exposure 
the company intends for og e to continue as an integrated utility engaged in the generation and the distribution of electricity and to represent over time approximately percent of the company s consolidated assets 
the remainder of the company s assets will be in enogex s pipeline businesses 
in addition to the incremental growth opportunities that enogex provides  the company believes that enogex s risk management capabilities  commercial skills and market information provide value to all of the company s businesses 
federal regulation in regard to the operations of the wholesale power market may change with the proposed standard market design initiative at the ferc 
in addition  oklahoma and arkansas legislatures and utility commissions may propose changes from time to time that could subject the utilities to market risk 
accordingly  the company is applying risk management practices to all of its operations in an effort to mitigate the potential adverse effect of any future regulatory changes 
in the near term  og e plans on increasing its investment and growing earnings largely through the acquisition of a merchant power plant 
as part of the occ s rate order on november   og e is seeking to purchase an electric power plant with at least megawatts mw of generating capacity and to include the cost of such plant in its rate base 
given the surplus power in the region  the company believes there is a continuing opportunity to purchase existing power plants at prices below the cost to build 
this should enable og e to generate electricity for its customers at prices below those being paid by og e under existing qualified cogeneration and small power production producers contracts qf contracts 
unless extended by og e  many of these qf contracts will expire over the next one to five years 
accordingly  og e will continue to explore opportunities to purchase power plants in order to serve its native load 
og e anticipates filing with appropriate regulatory agencies to increase base rates to recover its investment in any power plant acquired and expects that customers should realize overall lower rates through fuel savings due to the increased efficiency of these new plants and lower capital costs than those associated with the expiring qf contracts 
enogex initiated a program in to improve its financial performance 
as a part of this performance improvement program  enogex has sold approximately million in assets  reduced debt by percent  reduced its number of employees by percent and reorganized its operations 
in addition to improving its earnings  enogex will continue to take actions to reduce its exposure to commodity prices by  among other things  mitigating its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements and reducing earnings volatility 
while the company believes substantial progress has been achieved  substantial opportunities remain 
enogex expects to continue reviewing its work processes  rationalizing assets  renegotiating contracts to improve pricing on existing volumes and reducing costs to further improve its financial return in addition to pursuing opportunities for organic growth 
in  in addition to these ongoing efforts  a major upgrade of the information systems is expected to be substantially completed 
the company believes these upgrades will be a major step towards obtaining the data required for it to optimize its system  provide improved customer service and enable management to more accurately determine the earnings potential of the unregulated pipeline system 
the company does not anticipate significantly increasing its investment in enogex in accordance with the goal of targeting its pipeline businesses at percent of the company s consolidated assets 
forward looking statements except for the historical statements contained herein  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis  including the discussion in outlook  are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  estimate  expect  objective  possible  potential and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  prices of electricity  natural gas and natural gas liquids  each on a stand alone basis and in relation to each other  business conditions in the energy industry  competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by the company  unusual weather  state and federal legislative and regulatory decisions and initiatives  changes in accounting standards  rules or guidelines  creditworthiness of suppliers  customers  and other contractual parties  actions by ratings agencies  and the other risk factors listed in the reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
overview general the following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected the company s consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position during the last three years 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
known trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent considered relevant 
enogex previously was engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas the e p business 
since january   enogex has sold all of its e p business along with certain gas gathering and processing assets that were owned by enogex through its interest in the nustar joint venture nustar and its interest in belvan corp  belvan limited partnership and todd ranch limited partnership belvan 
as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these dispositions have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
operating results compared to the company reported earnings of per share in compared to earnings of per share in the reduced earnings were primarily due to impairment losses of per share in the fourth quarter of for enogex and the company 
excluding impairment charges  the company s earnings in would have been per share compared to per share in  when the company reported a per share impairment charge 
the company s results for and include per share and per share  respectively  from the discontinued operations discussed above 
see discontinued operations below for a further discussion 
og e contributed per share in compared to per share in the improvement in financial performance at og e is primarily attributable to lower operating and maintenance expenses  lower interest expenses and increased growth in og e s service territory partially offset by lower levels of natural gas transportation cost recovered  lower recoveries of fuel costs from arkansas customers  loss of revenue resulting from the january ice storm  lower kilowatt hour sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales  milder weather and higher depreciation expense 
enogex s operations  including discontinued operations  resulted in a loss of per share in compared to a loss of per share in the reduced earnings were primarily attributable to impairment losses of per share in the fourth quarter of related to the disposition of gas processing plants and compression assets that were no longer needed in enogex s business 
absent impairment charges in and and including discontinued operations  enogex would have earned per share in compared with a loss of per share in this improvement was primarily from the transportation and storage business as a result of additional firm revenues from new long term contracts to merchant electric generation facilities and increased storage revenues 
additionally  better fuel recoveries and lower interest expense contributed to the improvement and were only partially offset by lower volumes in gathering and processing 
as stated above  enogex s e p business  its interest in nustar and its interest in belvan have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements as these assets have been sold 
earnings from discontinued operations improved from per share in to per share in primarily related to a higher gross margin on natural gas liquids sales  an impairment charge recorded in for belvan  net gains on the sale of certain of these assets in  lower depreciation expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses partially offset by a lower gross margin on natural gas sales 
see results of operations discontinued operations 
the results of the holding company reflect a loss of per share in compared to a loss of per share in the reduced loss was primarily attributable to lower interest expenses partially offset by a lower income tax benefit and an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of related to the company s aircraft 
compared to the company reported earnings of per share in compared to earnings of per share in the reduced earnings were due to lower earnings contributions from og e and enogex and an impairment loss of per share in the fourth quarter of at enogex 
earnings from discontinued operations contributed per share in and per share in to the company s earnings 
og e contributed per share in compared to per share in the reduced earnings were primarily attributable to lower kilowatt hour sales to og e s customers system sales due to milder weather  lower levels of revenues recovered under various fuel and incentive riders and higher operating and maintenance expenses partially offset by increased growth in og e s service territory and lower interest expense 
enogex s operations  including discontinued operations  resulted in a loss of per share in compared to earnings of per share in the reduced earnings were primarily attributable to poor fractionation spreads in its gas processing business  lower margins in marketing and trading  higher operating expenses and a per share impairment loss related to the anticipated disposition of the belvan asset partially offset by better fuel recoveries and storage margins 
as stated above  enogex s e p business  its interest in nustar and its interest in belvan have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
earnings from these discontinued operations decreased from per share in to per share in primarily related to a lower gross margin on natural gas liquids sales  an impairment charge of per share in the fourth quarter of for belvan  a lower gain from the sale of working interests in for oil and gas properties located in texas and utah and higher operating and maintenance expenses partially offset by a higher natural gas sales gross margin  lower exploration expenses and lower depreciation expense 
see results of operations discontinued operations 
the results of the holding company reflect a loss of per share in compared to a loss of per share in the increased loss was primarily attributable to lower other income in  primarily due to the sale of the company s aircraft in  and a lower income tax benefit  partially offset by lower interest expenses 
regulatory considerations on october   og e  the occ staff  the oklahoma attorney general and other interested parties agreed to a settlement the settlement agreement of og e s rate case 
the administrative law judge subsequently recommended approval of the settlement agreement and on november   the occ signed a rate order containing the provisions of the settlement agreement and the new reduced rates went into effect january  the settlement agreement provides for  among other items i a million annual reduction in the electric rates of og e s oklahoma customers which begins with the first regular billing cycle occurring days after the issuance of the occ order approving the settlement agreement  ii recovery by og e  through rate base  of the capital expenditures associated with the january ice storm  iii recovery by og e  over three years  of the million in deferred operating costs  associated with the january ice storm  through og e s rider for off system sales  iv og e to acquire electric generating capacity new generation of not less than mw s to be integrated into og e s generation system 
og e expects that the new generation will provide savings  over a three year period  in excess of million 
if og e is unable to demonstrate at least million in savings  og e will be required to credit to its oklahoma customers any unrealized savings below million 
in the event og e does not acquire the new generation by december   og e will be required to credit million annually at a rate of of million per month for each month that the new generation is not in place to its oklahoma customers beginning january  and continuing through december  however  if og e purchases the new generation subsequent to january  the credit to oklahoma customers will terminate in the first month that the new generation begins initial operations and any credited amount to oklahoma customers will be included in the determination of the million targeted savings 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the settlement agreement and of other recent actions relating to og e s rates 
og e has been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility industry 
significant changes already have occurred and additional changes are being proposed to the wholesale electric market 
although it appears unlikely in the near future that changes will occur to retail regulation in the states served by og e due to the significant problems faced by california in its electric deregulation efforts and other factors  significant changes are possible  which could significantly change the manner in which og e conducts its business 
these developments at the federal and state levels are described in more detail below under electric competition  regulation 
asset disposals enogex sold approximately miles of transmission lines of the ozark pipeline located in pittsburg and latimer counties in oklahoma for approximately million in january the company will recognize a pre tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of related to the sale of these assets 
these assets were part of the natural gas pipeline segment 
enogex sold its interest in nustar for approximately million in february the company will recognize a pre tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of related to the sale of these assets 
these assets were part of the natural gas pipeline segment 
outlook general the company currently expects that earnings in will be between and per share  assuming  among other things  normal weather and continued customer growth in the electric utility service area and improved performance at enogex 
the company anticipates a contribution of approximately to million from og e  approximately to million from enogex and a loss of approximately million at the holding company 
the company has assumed approximately million average common shares outstanding for  up from approximately a million average in the company plans to issue equity in to support the capital structure at og e for its purchase of generation and for other corporate purposes including the repayment of short term debt 
the company plans to issue equity through a combination of a public offering and the issuance of shares through its dividend reinvestment plan 
the amount  method of issuance and timing cannot be determined at this time but will be dependent upon  among other things  the timing of  and the cost to  purchase a generation facility and market conditions 
during  og e expects operating revenues to decrease approximately million  which reflects the million rate reduction under the settlement agreement and approximately a million reduction due to the expiration in june of the generation efficiency performance rider gep rider 
these decreases are expected to be partially offset by approximately two percent growth in electric usage of approximately million and normalized weather of approximately million 
og e expects an increase in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately million partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous income items of approximately million 
key factors affecting og e s net income will be weather  og e s ability to control operating and maintenance expenses and customer growth 
expected net income assumes a percent effective tax rate 
during  enogex evaluated  redesigned and reorganized its internal work processes in order to achieve cost reductions and revenue enhancements within its businesses 
enogex is beginning to see the positive results of these efforts and expects continued improvement during as stated above  enogex manages its operations along three related businesses transportation and storage  gathering and processing  and marketing and trading 
in  these businesses are expected to produce a gross margin of approximately million  a million reduction from including discontinued operations 
the company expects approximately percent of enogex s gross margin during to be generated from its transportation and storage business as compared to percent in revenues in transportation and storage are primarily from gas transportation contracts with utilities in oklahoma and arkansas and independent power plants in oklahoma 
revenues in the transportation and storage business are expected to increase due to providing gas transportation service for a new independent power plant  which began operations in  and from a natural gas storage field purchased in the company expects its gathering and processing operations to contribute approximately percent of enogex s gross margin in as compared to percent in revenues in gathering and processing are expected to decrease in primarily due to anticipated lower volumes  the sale of the nustar and belvan properties  lower inlet volumes in oklahoma and assumed relatively flat processing margins compared to marketing and trading is expected to contribute approximately percent of enogex s gross margin in as compared to eight percent in revenues in marketing and trading are expected to increase in primarily due to increased volumes and higher margins 
enogex also expects approximately a million decrease in expenses during primarily due to approximately a million decrease in operating expenses and approximately a million decline in interest expense 
the million decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributable to a reduction of approximately million of expenses associated with discontinued operations and unusual charges of approximately million in primarily from a large customer bankruptcy  lost gas expense and severance costs 
the remaining million reduction in operating expenses is primarily due to a percent decrease in the number of employees during as well as process efficiencies which were partially offset by higher pension and medical expenses 
key factors affecting enogex s net income will be gathering and processing volumes on the system as well as natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and the level of system fuel costs 
gathering volumes will be determined by the level of natural gas production from the areas served by enogex 
processing volumes will be driven by the volume of wet gas on the system and whether  due to insufficient margins  any ethane or propane is rejected 
enogex expects to continue to seek opportunities to rationalize its asset base in an effort to lower costs and increase the return on its asset base 
the impairment of assets recorded in reflects these opportunities 
the company expects to continue to rationalize its compression and processing asset base  which may lead to future impairment charges 
the company does not currently anticipate that future charges  if any  will be of the magnitude recorded in the magnitude and timing  of these charges will be driven largely by the actual and projected utilization of compression and processing assets and the disposal value of any assets determined as surplus 
both og e and enogex have significant seasonality in their earnings 
og e typically shows minimal earnings or slight losses in the first and fourth quarters with a majority of earnings in the third quarter due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand 
at enogex  due to the sale of the e p business in  the seasonality of its earnings has changed for enogex expects to show a loss in the first quarter of  with approximately percent of its earnings in the second and fourth quarters and approximately percent in the third quarter 
the first quarter loss is primarily the result of underrecoveries of fuel in the transportation business 
first quarter underrecoveries of fuel typically are recouped in the other three quarters of the year 
as a result  the company expects to report  on a consolidated basis  a loss in the first quarter  approximately percent of its net income in the second quarter  approximately percent of its net income in the third quarter and break even results in the fourth quarter 
dividend policy the company s dividend policy is determined by the board of directors and is based on numerous factors  including management s estimation of the long term earnings power of its businesses 
the target payout ratio for the company is to pay out as dividends approximately percent of its earnings on an annual basis 
the target payout ratio has been determined after consideration of numerous factors  including the largely retail composition of our shareholder base  our financial position  our growth targets  the composition of our assets and investment opportunities 
on an operating basis excluding impairment charges  the company s earnings per share for exceeded the dividend rate of per share 
while the dividend payout ratio is expected to exceed the target payout ratio in  management after considering estimates of future earnings and numerous other factors  expects at this time that it will continue to recommend to the board of directors a continuance of the current dividend rate 
results of operations percent change from prior year in millions  except per share data operating income net income basic average common shares outstanding diluted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted earnings per average common share dividends declared per share in reviewing its consolidated operating results  the company believes that it is appropriate to focus on operating income as reported in its consolidated statements of income 
included in the operating income is a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million 
these impairments  primarily for the disposition of enogex natural gas processing and compression assets that were no longer needed in enogex s business  were made in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and significantly reduced operating results 
operating income was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amounts listed above exclude the results of enogex s e p business  nustar and belvan  which  as explained above  were sold during and and which are reported as discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations for a further discussion 
operating income loss by business segment in millions og e electric utility enogex natural gas pipeline a other operations b consolidated operating income a after recording an impairment charge of approximately million in b other operations primarily includes unallocated corporate expenses 
the following operating income analysis by business segment includes intercompany transactions that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
og e in millions operating revenues   fuel purchased power gross margin on revenues other operating expenses operating income system sales mwh a off system sales mwh total sales mwh a megawatt hour compared to og e s operating income increased approximately million or percent in as compared to the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a slightly higher gross margin due to growth in electric usage in og e s service territory and slightly lower operating expenses 
gross margin increased approximately million or percent in as compared to growth in the number of customers in og e s service territory and the resulting increase in electric sales of approximately percent increased the gross margin by approximately million 
the increase was offset by lower recoveries of fuel costs from arkansas customers through that state s automatic fuel adjustment clause of approximately million 
in arkansas  recovery of fuel costs is subject to a bandwidth mechanism 
if fuel costs are within the bandwidth range  recoveries are not adjusted on a monthly basis  rather they are reset annually on april gross margin also was reduced by approximately million due to milder weather 
lower recoveries under the gep rider  which terminated in june  decreased the gross margin by approximately million in additionally  lower levels of natural gas transportation cost that og e was allowed to recover from its customers as a result of the acquisition premium credit rider apc rider and the gas transportation adjustment credit rider gtac rider decreased the gross margin by approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these riders 
although total expenditures from the january ice storm of approximately million  which have been capitalized or deferred  did not impact operating results  the related loss of revenue due to interruption of service to our customers resulted in a decrease in the gross margin of approximately million in reduced amounts of off system sales decreased the gross margin by approximately million 
cost of goods sold for og e consists of fuel used in electric generation and purchased power 
fuel expense decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to primarily due to an percent decrease in the average cost of fuel per kilowatt hour kwh 
og e s electric generating capability is fairly evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers 
in  og e s fuel mix was percent coal and percent natural gas 
though og e has a higher installed capability of generation from natural gas units of percent  it has been more economical to generate electricity for our customers with lower priced coal 
purchased power costs decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to primarily due to a percent decrease in the volume of energy purchased and a percent decrease in the cost of purchased energy per kwh 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component included in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
while the regulatory mechanisms for recovering fuel costs differ in oklahoma and arkansas  in both states the costs are passed through to customers and are intended to provide neither an ultimate benefit nor detriment to og e 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays to enogex 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses  consisting of operating and maintenance expense  depreciation expense and taxes other than income  decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to og e s operating and maintenance expense decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in bad debt expense  a decrease of approximately million in contract labor costs and a decrease of approximately million in materials and supplies expense 
higher than normal bills driven by high natural gas prices early in  along with customer cut off moratoriums imposed during high temperature periods during the summer of contributed to significantly increased uncollectibles in the decrease in contract labor costs was due to higher contract labor costs incurred in due to the use of contractors to supplement og e s own crews to restore power after a major ice storm at the beginning of and a major wind storm in the early summer of the decreased operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by an increase in employee pension and benefit costs of approximately million 
pension expense increased primarily due to lower than forecasted returns on assets in the pension trust and the effect of lower discount rates used to measure the accumulated pension benefit obligation 
the general upward trend in medical costs also contributed to the increase in employee benefit costs 
depreciation expense increased approximately million or percent in as compared to due to a higher level of depreciable plant 
taxes other than income increased approximately million or percent in as compared to due to higher ad valorem taxes 
compared to og e s operating income decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to the decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a lower gross margin and significantly higher other operating expenses 
gross margin decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to gross margin was reduced by approximately million due to milder weather 
lower recoveries of fuel costs from arkansas customers through that state s automatic fuel adjustment clause decreased the gross margin by approximately million 
lower recoveries under the gep rider decreased the gross margin by approximately million in lower levels of natural gas transportation cost that og e was allowed to recover from its customers through the apc rider and gtac rider decreased the gross margin by approximately million in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these riders 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately million due to customer growth in og e s service territory and the resulting increase in electric sales of percent 
fuel expense decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to primarily due to lower fuel consumption in although fuel consumed was down in  the average cost of fuel per kwh increased percent 
purchased power costs increased approximately million or percent in as compared to primarily due to an increase in capacity purchases under a wholesale purchase contract that og e maintains with southwestern public service corp  a percent increase in the cost of purchased energy per kwh and a percent increase in total energy purchased 
other operating expenses  consisting of operating and maintenance expense  depreciation expense and taxes other than income  increased approximately million or percent in as compared to og e s operating and maintenance expense increased approximately million or percent in as compared to this increase was due to an increase of approximately million in bad debt expense  approximately million in employee pension and benefit costs and approximately million in contract labor costs 
bad debt expense increased due to higher than normal bills driven by high natural gas prices early in  customer cut off moratoriums imposed during high temperature periods in the summer and the general slow down in the economy 
employee pension and benefit costs increased primarily due to lower than forecasted returns on assets in the pension trust and the effect of lower discount rates used to measure the accumulated pension benefit obligation 
the general upward trend in medical costs also contributed to the increase in employee benefit costs 
contract labor costs increased due to the use of contractors to supplement og e s own crews to restore power after a major ice storm at the beginning of and a major wind storm in the early summer of these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in miscellaneous expenses and an increase in the amount of certain expenses capitalized as part of electric plant 
depreciation expense increased approximately million or percent in as compared to due to a higher level of depreciable plant 
taxes other than income increased approximately million or percent in as compared to due to higher ad valorem taxes

compared to enogex s operating income for decreased approximately million or percent as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to impairment losses in the fourth quarter of related to gas processing plants and compression assets  which enogex determined were no longer needed in its business 
absent the impairment charges  enogex s operating income for would have been approximately million higher than in primarily due to improved gross margins in transportation and storage and in marketing and trading  which were only partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses for transportation and storage and decreased gross margins in gathering and processing 
enogex s e p business and its interest in belvan were sold during and its interest in nustar was sold in  accordingly  these are reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
see discontinued operations below for a further discussion 
during  gathering and processing posted a loss of approximately million in operating income  which was a decrease of approximately million as compared to the decrease in operating income is primarily due to approximately million of impairment losses in the fourth quarter of related to the disposition of gas processing plants and compression assets that were no longer needed in enogex s business 
gross margins were approximately million in down from approximately million in the primary factors in reduced gross margins in as compared to are lower volumes of natural gas gathered of million british thermal units mmbtu as compared to mmbtu s in and processed volumes of million gallons as compared to million gallons in processed volumes were adversely affected by the january ice storm  which enogex estimates caused processed volumes to be approximately million gallons less 
the average natural gas liquids price realized in was per gallon as compared to per gallon in other operating expenses in gathering and processing  consisting of operating and maintenance expense  impairment charges  depreciation expense and taxes other than income  increased approximately million or percent in as compared to the impairment charge noted above accounted for approximately million of this increase 
operating and maintenance expense decreased approximately million in as compared to lower payroll expenses of approximately million  lower materials and supplies expense of approximately million and lower fees for outside services of approximately million were partially offset by increased allocations of overhead from the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation expense increased approximately million as compared to  primarily the result of a higher level of depreciable plant 
taxes other than income decreased approximately million due to lower ad valorem taxes 
during  transportation and storage contributed approximately million of enogex s operating income  which was an increase of approximately million as compared to the gross margin increased percent to approximately million in from approximately million in gross margins benefited from increased fuel recoveries of approximately million as compared to  increased firm transportation revenue  primarily the result of new transportation contracts to merchant electric generation  of approximately million as compared to  higher volumes and prices on interruptible transmission service of approximately million as compared to  increased firm and interruptible transportation on ozark of approximately million as compared to and increased storage revenues of approximately million as compared to other operating expenses in transportation and storage  consisting of operating and maintenance expense  impairment charges  depreciation expense and taxes other than income  increased approximately million or percent in as compared to operating and maintenance expense increased approximately million in as compared to the primary increase was approximately million in uncollectible accounts as a result of the bankruptcy of a large customer  increased employee benefit costs of approximately million  increased materials and supplies expense of approximately million and increased building rentals and other miscellaneous expenses of approximately million 
taxes other than income increased approximately million  the result of higher ad valorem taxes 
depreciation expense increased approximately million as compared to  primarily the result of a higher level of depreciable plant 
the expenses include impairment charges of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to the disposition of compression assets that were no longer needed in enogex s business 
during  marketing and trading contributed approximately million to enogex s operating income  which was an improvement of approximately million as compared to the loss of approximately million for the increased contribution to operating income is primarily due to an increase in gross margin of approximately million in as compared to gross margins benefited from approximately a million increase in mark to market gains on storage contracts that should be substantially realized during the first quarter of  increased natural gas sales margins of approximately million and increased income from other financial instruments of approximately million partially offset by approximately a million increase related to demand fees expense  approximately a million decrease in third party gas storage management revenues and approximately a million decrease in the power sales gross margin 
compared to enogex s operating income for decreased approximately million or percent as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased gross margins in processing and in marketing and trading and increased operating and maintenance expenses for gathering and for transmission 
these decreases were partially offset by an increased gross margin in transmission 
enogex s e p business  its interest in nustar and its interest in belvan have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
see discontinued operations for a further discussion 
during  gathering and transmission contributed approximately million of enogex s operating income  which was an increase of approximately million as compared to the increase can be directly attributable to efforts by enogex in to resolve the under recovery of pipeline system fuel expenses that was reported in the fourth quarter results 
enogex filed for fuel recovery rate adjustments with the ferc and the new rates became effective february  the impact of the filing enabled enogex to significantly improve the recovery of pipeline system fuel expenses for the remainder of the year and in the future 
the gross margin for gathering and transmission increased approximately million in as compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in pipeline system gas fuel expenses recovered in compared to the under recovery of pipeline system fuel expenses in also contributing to the increased gross margin was an increase of approximately million in storage margins  higher prices on interruptible transmission service of approximately million  approximately million increased firm transportation revenues  primarily the result of higher volumes  increased firm and interruptible transportation on ozark of approximately million and an increase of approximately million in other operating revenues 
other operating expenses in gathering and transmission  consisting of operating and maintenance expense  depreciation expense and taxes other than income  increased approximately million or percent in as compared to operating and maintenance expense increased approximately million in as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher fees for outside services of approximately million  higher payroll expenses of approximately million  higher materials and supplies expense of approximately million and higher building rentals and other miscellaneous expenses of approximately million 
depreciation expense increased approximately million  primarily the result of a higher level of depreciable plant 
taxes other than income increased approximately million due to higher ad valorem taxes 
during  processing contributed approximately million of enogex s operating income  which was a decrease of approximately million as compared to the gross margin for processing decreased approximately million in as compared to due to poor fractionation spreads during fractionation spread is the price received for liquids sold after they are processed out of the natural gas stream  less the price of the natural gas lost in the process 
during the first quarter of  these spreads were negative 
a significant percentage of volumes transported on the enogex pipeline system were processed under keep whole arrangements 
under these arrangements  and in order to keep its shippers whole on a btu basis  enogex products corporation replaced the btu value of the liquids with natural gas at market prices 
in order to minimize the impact of negative fractionation spreads  ethane and propane were rejected whenever possible 
during  approximately million gallons were rejected compared to approximately million gallons in the average fractionation spread realized for was per mmbtu compared to per mmbtu for other operating expenses in processing  consisting of operating and maintenance expense  depreciation expense and taxes other than income  decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to operating and maintenance expense decreased approximately million in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in electric compression partially offset by higher materials and supplies expense of approximately million 
depreciation expense increased approximately million  primarily the result of a higher level of depreciable plant 
during  marketing and trading posted a loss of approximately million to enogex s operating income  which was a decrease of approximately million as compared to the contribution of approximately million for the gross margin decreased approximately million in as compared to this decrease in gross margin is primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in the natural gas  crude oil and electric power trading gross margins  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in other operating revenues primarily related to gas storage revenues

the effective date of the sale was january  and the closing occurred on february  the company will recognize a pre tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of related to the sale of these assets 
as a result of these sale transactions  enogex s e p business  its interest in nustar and its interest in belvan  all of which were part of the natural gas pipeline segment  have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
results for these discontinued operations are summarized and discussed below 
in millions operating revenues gas purchased for resale natural gas purchases other gross margin on revenues other operating expenses operating income compared to gross margin decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to approximately a million decrease in natural gas sales due to lower prices and sales volumes in as compared to for exploration and production  approximately a million decrease in natural gas and natural gas liquids sales related to lower prices and sales volumes related to nustar and belvan and approximately a million decrease in crude oil sales 
other operating expenses decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to other operating expenses include operating and maintenance expenses  depreciation expense and taxes other than income

accordingly  while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of unconditional purchase obligations of og e noted above may increase capital requirements  such costs are recoverable through automatic fuel adjustment clauses and have little  if any  impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc also have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays to enogex 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
the company s primary needs for capital are related to replacing or expanding existing facilities in og e s electric utility business and replacing or expanding existing facilities at enogex 
other capital requirements are primarily related to maturing debt  operating lease obligations  hedging activities  natural gas storage and delays in recovering unconditional purchase obligations 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings and permanent financings 
the amounts shown in the chart on page do not include the cost of acquiring an electric generating plant with at least mw of capacity  which og e intends to acquire during in accordance with the settlement agreement approved by the occ on november  any generating facility acquired by og e is expected to be financed through the issuance of common stock by the company and through the issuance of debt by og e 
capital requirements and financing activities total capital requirements  consisting of capital expenditures and maturities and retirements of long term debt  were approximately million and contractual obligations  net of recoveries through automatic fuel adjustment clauses  were approximately million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of approximately million in approximately million of capital expenditures in were associated with the costs of the january ice storm  which severely damaged og e s electric transmission and distribution systems 
approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
excluding the ice storm  total net capital requirements would have been approximately million 
this compares to net capital requirements of approximately million and net contractual obligations of approximately million totaling approximately million in  of which approximately million was to comply with environmental regulations 
during  the company s sources of capital were internally generated funds from operating cash flows  short term borrowings and proceeds from the sale of assets 
the company s short term borrowings consist primarily of commercial paper and short term bank loans 
the company uses its commercial paper to fund changes in working capital 
changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the company s business  the revenue lag between billing and collection for customers and fuel inventories 
in  oge energy corp 
commercial paper was used to fund expenditures associated with the ice storm 
additionally  the company assumed debt of approximately million related to the purchase of a gas storage facility 
as a result  current liabilities exceed current assets by approximately million at december  at december   the company had outstanding short term borrowings of approximately million 
during  million of enogex s long term debt matured and million was redeemed with internally generated funds  funds from the sale of assets and short term debt 
the following table itemizes the retirement of long term debt during in millions series due series due series due series due total effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas no 
requires the company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges  as well as the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  must be recognized as a derivative fair value gain or loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the value of effective fair value hedges are recorded in price risk management assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  with the corresponding offset recorded against the value in the hedged asset or liability 
the value of effective cash flow hedges are recorded in price risk management assets and liabilities with the corresponding component in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is later reclassified to earnings when the related hedged transaction is reflected in income 
physical delivery contracts that are deemed to be normal purchases or normal sales and have been designated as such are not accounted for as derivatives 
physical delivery contracts that are not deemed to be normal purchases or normal sales are accounted for as derivatives 
based on the company s derivative positions related to non trading activity and market prices in effect at january   the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million million after tax 
this amount was associated with certain cash flow hedges in place at january  and was reclassified into earnings during as the hedged production was sold 
as a result of subsequent changes in market prices  the company ultimately recognized a million loss on the settlement of these contracts during  including a gain of million related to the ineffective portion of the change in value of the derivative contracts 
as of december   the company did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges  and  as such  had no amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges 
as of december   the company had one outstanding cash flow hedge  and approximately million after tax was included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
during  the company entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements i og e entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective march   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due october   to a variable rate based on the three month london interbank offering rate libor and ii enogex entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective july   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the three month libor 
on march   enogex monetized its interest rate swap agreement and received cash of approximately million  which is being amortized over the life of the related debt 
on march   enogex entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the three month libor 
on july   enogex monetized its interest rate swap agreement and received cash of approximately million  of which approximately million was recorded against interest receivable and the remaining amount of approximately million is being amortized over the life of the related debt 
on august  and on october   enogex entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the six month libor 
these interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under sfas no 
and meet all of the requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective portion as allowed by the shortcut method under sfas no 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
on april   the company entered into a one year interest rate swap agreement to lock in a fixed rate of percent  effective april   on million of variable rate short term debt 
this interest rate swap initially qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
however  due to unexpected changes in the level of commercial paper issued during the third quarter of  hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
was discontinued as of july   and all subsequent changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded as interest expense 
the objective of this interest rate swap was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to reduce exposure to short term interest rate volatility associated with the company s commercial paper program 
future capital requirements the company s to construction program does not include the building of any additional generating units 
instead  in accordance with the settlement agreement approved by the occ on november   og e intends to purchase an electric generating plant with at least mw s of generating capacity 
the company believes that an efficient combined cycle plant can be purchased for a price less than the cost to build a new facility 
to reliably meet the increased electricity needs of og e s customers during the foreseeable future  og e will continue to invest to maintain the integrity of the delivery system 
approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
during  actual asset returns for the company s defined benefit pension plan were adversely affected by continued deterioration in the equity markets 
approximately percent of the pension plan assets are invested in listed common stocks with the balance invested in corporate debt and us government securities 
for the year ended december   asset returns on the pension plan were approximately negative percent 
during the same time  corporate bond yields  which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations  have continued to decline 
contributions to the pension plan increased from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was necessitated by the lower investment returns on assets and lower discount rates used to value the accumulated pension benefit obligations 
during  the company plans to contribute approximately million to the pension plan 
the level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates 
higher returns on plan assets and increases in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the plan 
the following table indicates the sensitivity of the pension plans funded status to these variables 
impact on change funded status actual plan asset returns percent milli on discount rate percent milli on contributions million milli on expected long term return on plan assets percent none as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in the company made several changes to its pension plan  including the adoption of a cash balance benefit feature for employees hired after january  the cash balance plan may provide lower post employment pension benefits to employees  which could result in less pension expense being recorded 
over the near term  the company s cash requirements for the plan are not expected to be materially different than the requirements existing prior to the plan changes 
however  as the population of employees included in the cash balance plan feature increases  the company s cash requirements should decrease and will be much less sensitive to changes in discount rates 
during and  the company made contributions to the pension plan that exceeded amounts previously recognized as net periodic pension expense and recorded a prepaid benefit obligation at december  and of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the company s projected pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets by approximately million and million  respectively 
as a result of recording a prepaid benefit obligation and having a funded status where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets  provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  required the recognition of an additional minimum liability in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and the offset of this entry was an intangible asset and accumulated other comprehensive income  net of a deferred tax asset  therefore  this adjustment did not impact the results of operations in or and did not require a usage of cash and is therefore excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the amount recorded as an intangible asset equaled the unrecognized prior service cost with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income represents a net periodic pension cost to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income in future periods 
on october   fitch ratings fitch reaffirmed the ratings of oge energy corp 
s senior unsecured debt at a and short term debt at f  og e s senior unsecured debt at aa and short term debt at f and enogex s senior unsecured debt at bbb 
the rating outlook is stable 
fitch cited the solid financial position  low business risk and strong cash flows at og e and the higher risk nature of enogex acknowledging that renewed management focus on cost reductions and reducing cash flow volatility across all unregulated business lines should allow for gradual strengthening of enogex s credit profile 
on january   standard poor s ratings services standard poor s lowered the credit ratings of oge energy corp 
s  og e s and enogex s senior unsecured debt from a to bbb 
oge energy corp 
s short term commercial paper ratings were affirmed at a the outlook is now stable 
standard poor s cited the relatively low risk low cost efficient operations of og e and the business and financial profile of enogex  which has higher risk 
standard poor s further cited the rationalization at enogex has resulted in a business risk reduction  but it is not adequate to warrant an improvement in the overall business score 
the company may experience somewhat higher borrowing costs but does not expect the actions by standard poor s to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
at december   moody s investors service moody s credit ratings of oge energy corp 
senior unsecured debt was a  og e senior unsecured debt was a and enogex senior unsecured debt was baa on february   moody s lowered the credit ratings of oge energy corp 
senior unsecured debt to baa from a  og e senior unsecured debt to a from a and enogex senior unsecured debt to baa from baa oge energy corp 
s short term commercial paper rating was unchanged at p the outlook for oge energy corp 
and og e is stable and enogex is negative 
moody s cited the diminished credit profile of both og e and enogex with og e having competitive generation and stable cash flow but with regulatory risk associated with new generation and enogex exposed to the seasonality of its gas processing business although it has reduced its keep whole exposure 
the company may experience somewhat higher borrowing costs but does not expect the actions by moody s to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as a result of enogex s rating being lowered to baa  oge energy corp 
was required to issue a million guarantee on enogex s behalf for a counterparty 
as of december   in the event moody s or standard poor s were to lower enogex s senior unsecured debt rating to a below investment grade rating  enogex would be required to post less than million of collateral to satisfy its obligation under its financial and physical contracts 
in the event one or more of the credit ratings were to fall below investment grade  enogex may seek oge energy corp 
guarantees to satisfy its customers in order to avoid disruption of its marketing and trading business 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
future financing requirements may be dependent  to varying degrees  upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  acquisitions of other businesses  actions by rating agencies  inflation  changes in environmental laws or regulations  rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies  new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators 
future sources of financing apart from the funds required to purchase at least mw s of a power plant pursuant to the settlement agreement  management expects that internally generated funds will be adequate over the next three years to meet other anticipated capital expenditures  operating needs  payment of dividends and maturities of long term debt 
short term borrowings will be used to meet working capital requirements 
the following table shows the company s lines of credit in place at march  short term borrowings will consist of a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper 
lines of credit in millions entity amount maturity oge energy corp 
a april  january  january  og e june  total a the lines of credit at oge energy corp 
were used to back up the company s commercial paper borrowings which were approximately million at march  no borrowings were outstanding at march  under any of the lines of credit shown above 
the company s ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a commercial paper ratings downgrade 
the lines of credit contain ratings triggers that require annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if the company suffers an adverse ratings impact 
the impact of a downgrade of the company s rating would result in an increase in the cost of short term borrowings of approximately five to basis points  but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the ratings triggers 
see future capital requirements for potential financing needs upon a downgrade by moody s of enogex s long term debt rating 
also contributing to the liquidity of the company have been numerous asset sales by enogex 
since january   completed sales generated proceeds of approximately million 
sales proceeds generated to date have been used to reduce debt at enogex and commercial paper at the holding company 
unlike the company and enogex  og e must obtain regulatory approval from the ferc in order to borrow on a short term basis 
og e has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of assets that may complement its existing portfolio 
permanent financing would be required for any such acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements particularly as they relate to pension expense and impairment estimates 
however  the company believes it has taken conservative positions  where assumptions and estimates are used  in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates 
in management s opinion  the areas of the company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in the valuation of pension plan assumptions  impairment estimates  contingency reserves  unbilled revenue for og e  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the valuation of energy purchases and sales contracts and gas storage inventory 
the selection  application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
consolidated including electric utility and natural gas pipeline segments pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
the pension plan rate assumptions are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on the plan assets portfolio 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
see future capital requirements for a further discussion 
the company assesses potential impairments of assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the amount of any recognized impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the asset subject to impairment compared to the carrying amount of such asset 
in the normal course of business  the company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims made by third parties  environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies 
management consults with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if in management s opinion  the company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the company s financial statements 
electric utility segment og e reads its customers meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month 
as a result  there is a significant amount of customers electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month 
unbilled revenue is presented in accrued unbilled revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period 
at december  and  accrued unbilled revenues were approximately million and million  respectively 
the estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers 
all customer balances are written off if not collected within six months after the account is finalized 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate 
the provision rate is based on a month historical average of actual balances written off 
to the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections  there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is included in other operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
natural gas pipeline segment operating revenues for transportation  gathering and storage services for enogex are estimated each month based on the prior month s activity and any known adjustments 
the estimates are reversed in the following month and customers are billed on actual volumes and contracted prices 
gas sales are calculated on current month nominations and contracted prices 
operating revenues associated with the production of natural gas liquids are estimated based on current month estimated production and contracted prices 
these amounts are reversed in the following month and the customers are billed on actual production and contracted prices 
estimated operating revenues are reflected in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
estimates for gas purchases are based on sales volumes and contracted purchase prices 
estimated gas purchases are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income

marketing activities include the trading and marketing of natural gas  electricity  and natural gas liquids 
the vast majority of positions expire within two years  which is when the cash aspect of the transactions will be realized 
in nearly all cases  independent market prices are obtained and compared to the values used for the mark to market valuation  and an oversight group outside of the marketing organization monitors all modeling methodologies and assumptions 
the recorded value of the energy contracts may change significantly in the future as the market price for the commodity changes  but the value is still subject to the risk loss limitations provided under the company s risk policies 
the company utilizes a model to a small extent to estimate the fair value of its energy contracts including derivatives that do not have an independent market price 
approximately percent of the company s recorded fair value of energy contracts and gas in storage utilize quoted market prices in an active market 
at december   unrealized mark to market gains were approximately million  which included approximately million based on independent market prices 
energy contracts are presented in price risk management assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
see accounting pronouncements for a further discussion 
gas storage inventory used in oeri s trading activities that was acquired prior to october  is marked to market utilizing a gas index that in management s opinion approximates the current market value of natural gas in that region as of the balance sheet date 
however  the actual market value could materially change in the future due to changes in market conditions such as weather or supply and demand 
gas storage inventory acquired after october  is accounted for at the lower of cost or market in accordance with the guidance in eitf gas storage inventory is presented in fuel inventories on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income 
customer balances are written off when the company concludes the required payment of specific amounts owed is unlikely to occur 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is established on a case by case basis when the company believes the required payment of specific amounts owed is unlikely to occur

 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation are met  a regulatory asset or liability should be recorded to recognize differences between asset retirement costs recorded under sfas no 
and legal or other asset retirement costs recognized for ratemaking purposes 
upon the application of sfas no 
 all rate regulated entities that are subject to the statement requirements will be required to quantify the amount of previously accumulated asset retirement costs for other than legal obligations and reclassify those differences as regulatory assets or liabilities 
the company has approximately million that has been accrued in depreciation rates and recorded as a liability in accumulated depreciation related to estimated asset retirement obligations 
this balance will be reclassified as a regulatory liability in the first quarter of also  beginning in the first quarter of  changes in accounting procedures will direct accruals for removal costs to be credited directly to regulatory liabilities 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that an impairment loss be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and that the measurement of any impairment loss be the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
also requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
adoption of sfas no 
is required for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities and supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when the entity commits to an exit plan under eitf sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
adoption of sfas no 
is required for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  the company has adopted this new standard effective january  and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the eitf reached a consensus on certain issues covered in eitf no 
 issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
one consensus of eitf no 
requires that all mark to market gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on financial derivative contracts as defined in sfas no 
be shown net in the income statement for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december   with reclassification required for prior periods presented 
the company has adopted this consensus effective january  and the application of this consensus did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations as this consensus supports the company s historical presentation of financial derivative contracts 
in october  the eitf reached a consensus to rescind eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  as amended effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  effective october   all new contracts and physical inventories that would have been accounted for under eitf no 
are no longer marked to market through earnings unless the contracts meet the definition of a derivative under sfas no 
application of the consensus for energy contracts and inventory that existed on or before october  that remain in effect at the date this consensus is initially applied will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb as a result  only energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative in sfas no 
will be carried at fair value 
the company has adopted this consensus effective january  resulting in an approximate million after tax loss 
the loss  which will be accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  is primarily related to natural gas held in storage for trading purposes 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation which includes the prospective method  modified prospective method and retroactive restatement method 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
adoption of the annual disclosure and voluntary transition requirements of sfas no 
is required for annual financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  adoption of the interim disclosure requirements of sfas no 
is required for interim periods beginning after december  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 the company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of accounting for its stock based employee compensation plans in accordance with apb opinion no

electric competition  regulation as previously reported  the electric restructuring act of the act was designed to provide retail customers in oklahoma a choice of their electric supplier by july  additional implementing legislation was to be adopted by the oklahoma legislature to address many specific issues associated with the act and with deregulation 
in may  a bill addressing the specific issues of deregulation was passed in the oklahoma state senate and then was defeated in the oklahoma house of representatives 
in may  the oklahoma legislature passed senate bill sb  which postponed the scheduled start date for customer choice from july  until at least in addition to postponing the date for customer choice  sb calls for a nine member task force to further study the issues surrounding deregulation 
the task force includes the governor or his designee  the oklahoma attorney general  the occ chair and several legislative leaders  among others 
in the current legislative session  senate bill has been recently introduced to repeal the act 
it is unknown at this time whether the bill will be passed into law 
the company will continue to actively participate in the legislative process and expects to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
as a result of the failures of california s attempt to deregulate its electricity markets  the enron bankruptcy  and associated impacts on the industry  efforts to restructure the electricity market in oklahoma appear at this time to be delayed indefinitely 
in april  arkansas passed a law the restructuring law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level 
the restructuring law  like the act  would have significantly affected og e s future operations 
og e s electric service area includes parts of western arkansas  including fort smith 
the restructuring law initially targeted customer choice of electricity providers by january  in february  the restructuring law was amended to delay the start date of customer choice of electric providers in arkansas until october   with the apsc having discretion to further delay implementation to october  in march  the restructuring law was repealed 
the occ also has adopted rules that are designed to make the gas utility business in oklahoma more competitive 
these rules do not impact the electric industry 
the rules are expected to offer increased opportunities to enogex s pipeline and related businesses 
although efforts to increase electric competition at the state level have been stalled  there have been several initiatives implemented at the federal level to increase competition in the wholesale markets for electricity 
the national energy policy act of energy act  among other things  promoted the development of independent power producers ipps 
the energy act was followed by ferc order and order  which facilitated third party utilization of the transmission grid for sales of wholesale power 
the energy act  orders and  and other ferc policies and initiatives have significantly increased competition in the wholesale power market 
utilities  including og e  have increased their own in house wholesale marketing efforts and the number of entities with whom they historically traded 
moreover  power marketers are an increasingly important presence in the industry 
these entities typically arbitrage wholesale price differentials by buying power produced by others in one market and selling it in another 
ipp s also are becoming a more significant sector of the electric utility industry 
in both oklahoma and arkansas  significant additions of new power plants have been announced  almost all of it from ipps 
notwithstanding these developments in the wholesale power market  the ferc recognized that impediments remained to the achievement of fully competitive wholesale markets including i engineering and economic inefficiencies inherent in the current operation and expansion of the transmission grid  and ii continuing opportunities for transmission owners primarily electric utilities to discriminate in the operation of their transmission facilities in favor of their own or affiliated power marketing activities 
in the past  the ferc only encouraged utilities to join and place their transmission systems under the operational control of independent system operators isos 
on december   the ferc issued order  its final rule on regional transmission organizations rtos 
order is intended to have the effect of turning the nation s transmission facilities into independently operated common carriers that offer comparable service to all would be users 
although adopting a voluntary approach towards rto formation  the ferc stressed that order does not preclude it from requiring rto participation 
order set out a timetable for every jurisdictional utility including og e to either join in an rto filing  or  alternatively  to submit a filing describing its efforts to join an rto  the reasons for not participating in an rto proposal and any obstacles to participation  and its plans for further work toward participation 
og e is a member of the spp  the regional reliability organization for oklahoma  arkansas  kansas  louisiana  missouri and part of texas 
og e participated with the spp in the development of regional transmission tariffs and executed an agency agreement with the spp to facilitate interstate transmission operations within this region 
in october  the spp filed its application with the ferc to become an rto 
in july  the ferc determined that the spp did not have adequate scope and configuration to be granted rto status 
the spp was encouraged to explore the possibility of joining an rto to be formed in the southeastern region of the united states and to explore the feasibility of becoming a part of the recently approved rto being established by the midwest independent system operator miso 
the spp and miso entered negotiations during the late summer of to combine the spp and miso and to form a new regional transmission entity that would combine the control areas of miso and spp  capture certain synergies that would be available from the combined organization  and allow member companies in the spp certain options with respect to membership in the combined organization 
the officers of miso and of spp  under the direction of their respective boards of directors developed documentation to effect the merger of spp and miso into a new organization  and the transaction was approved by the spp board of directors 
on february   og e executed a conditional miso membership application to join the resulting company as a transmission owner  subject to certain conditions being either met or waived 
on the same date  og e executed the conditional withdrawal agreement with the spp 
the conditional withdrawal agreement would have had the effect of terminating og e s membership in the spp  except for regional reliability purposes  at such time as the miso spp combination received all necessary regulatory approvals  the required number of spp member companies executed the conditional membership application to join miso  and the spp and miso merger transaction were closed 
og e filed with the apsc a cost benefit analysis to demonstrate that og e s joining the miso spp combination would have been in the public interest 
one of the conditions to the spp and miso merger transaction was that two thirds of the load served by transmission owners within the spp were to execute the conditional membership application and to execute the conditional withdrawal agreement with the spp 
during march it became apparent to the spp board of directors that the conditional membership applications would not be executed by transmission owners representing two thirds of the load in the spp 
at its meeting on march   the spp board of directors directed the president of spp to open discussion with the miso board of directors concerning termination of the proposed miso spp combination 
on march   miso and spp announced that their respective boards had voted to terminate their merger because the conditions required to close the transaction would not be met in the foreseeable future 
og e has remained a member of the spp while the miso spp combination was pending  and og e will continue to be a member of the spp as the spp  other spp members and og e evaluate the next steps necessary for compliance with the ferc s order in the meantime  the spp will continue to offer open access transmission service in the spp region under the spp open access transmission tariff 
termination of the proposed miso spp combination and og e s continued membership in the spp are not expected to significantly impact the company s consolidated financial results 
in october  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to adopt new standards of conduct rules applicable to all jurisdictional electric and natural gas transmission providers 
the proposed rules would replace the current rules governing the electric transmission and wholesale electric functions of electric utilities and the rules governing natural gas transportation and wholesale gas supply functions 
the proposed rules would expand the definition of affiliate and further limit communications between transmission functions and supply functions  and could materially increase operating costs of market participants  including og e and enogex 
in april  the ferc staff issued a reaction paper  generally rejecting the comments of parties opposed to the proposed rules 
final rules have been delayed while the ferc pursues development of its standard market design rulemaking 
in july  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on standard market design rulemaking for regulated utilities 
if implemented as proposed  the rulemaking will substantially change how wholesale markets operate throughout the united states 
the proposed rulemaking expands the ferc s intent to unbundle transmission operations from integrated utilities and ensure robust competition in wholesale markets 
the rule contemplates that all wholesale and retail customers will be on a single network transmission service tariff 
the rule also contemplates the implementation of a bid based system for buying and selling energy in wholesale markets 
rtos or independent transmission providers will administer the market 
rtos will also be responsible for regional plans that identify opportunities to construct new transmission  generation or demand side programs to reduce transmission constraints and meet regional energy requirements 
finally  the rule envisions the development of regional market monitors responsible for ensuring the individual participants do not exercise unlawful market power 
the ferc recently extended the comment period  but anticipates that the final rules will be in place in and the contemplated market changes will take place in and on august   the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to adopt new rules governing corporate money pools  which include jurisdictional public utility or pipeline subsidiaries of nonregulated parent companies 
the proposed rules would require documentation of transactions within such money pools  a proprietary capital account of the jurisdictional utility of percent  and would require the nonregulated parent company to have an investment grade rating 
several parties have filed comments on the proposed rule 
no final rule has been issued 
og e  as a regulated utility  is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
provides that certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets  based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates 
management s expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment 
og e initially records costs i that are probable of future recovery as a deferred charge until such time as the cost is approved by a regulatory authority  then the cost is reclassified as a regulatory asset  and ii that are probable of future liability as a deferred credit until such time as the amount is approved by a regulatory authority  then the amount is reclassified as a regulatory liability 
as discussed previously  legislation was enacted in oklahoma and arkansas that was to restructure the electric utility industry in those states 
the arkansas legislation was repealed and implementation of the oklahoma restructuring legislation has been delayed and seems unlikely to proceed during the near future 
yet  if and when implemented this legislation would deregulate og e s electric generation assets and cause the company to discontinue the use of sfas no 
 with respect to the related regulatory assets 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge of up to approximately million  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the previously enacted oklahoma and arkansas legislation would not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and the company believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory assets is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on the cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory assets related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
the company has approximately million of regulatory assets related to the transmission and distribution assets 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
commitments and contingencies the company through its subsidiaries is defending various claims and legal actions  including environmental actions  which are common to its operations 
the company s subsidiaries  primarily og e  also could be impacted by various proposed environmental regulations that if adopted  could result in significant increases in capital and operating expenditures 
besides the various existing contingencies herein described  and those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s ability to fund its future operational needs and to finance its construction program could be impacted by numerous factors beyond its control  such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  acquisitions of other businesses  actions by rating agencies  inflation  changes in environmental laws or regulations  rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies and market entry of competing electric power generators 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the risk management process established by the company is designed to measure both quantitative and qualitative risks in its businesses 
a corporate risk management department  under the direction of a corporate risk management committee  has been established to review these risks on a regular basis 
the company is exposed to market risk in its normal course of business  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
the company engages in price risk management for both trading and non trading purposes 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies on hedging practices 
derivative positions are monitored using techniques such as mark to market valuation  value at risk and sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations and commercial paper 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the company may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
during  the company entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements i og e entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective march   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due october   to a variable rate based on the three month libor and ii enogex entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective july   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the three month libor 
on march   enogex monetized its interest rate swap agreement and received cash of approximately million  which is being amortized over the life of the related debt 
on march   enogex entered into a new interest rate swap agreement to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the three month libor 
on july   enogex monetized its interest rate swap agreement and received cash of approximately million  of which approximately million was recorded against interest receivable and the remaining amount of approximately million is being amortized over the life of the related debt 
on august  and on october   enogex entered into new interest rate swap agreements to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the six month libor 
these interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under sfas no 
and meet all of the requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective portion as allowed by the shortcut method under sfas no 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
on april   the company entered into a one year interest rate swap agreement to lock in a fixed rate of percent  effective april   on million of variable rate short term debt 
this interest rate swap initially qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
however  due to unexpected changes in the level of commercial paper issued during the third quarter of  hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
was discontinued as of july   and all subsequent changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded as interest expense 
the objective of this interest rate swap was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to reduce exposure to short term interest rate volatility associated with the company s commercial paper program 
the fair value of the company s long term debt is based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues with similar maturities 
the valuation of the company s interest rate swaps was determined primarily based on quoted market prices 
the following table shows the company s long term debt maturities and the weighted average interest rates by maturity date 
year end fair dollars in millions thereaf ter total value fixed rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt principal amount a 
weighted average interest rate a amount includes an increase to the fair value of long term debt for appr oximately million due to the company s interest rate swaps 
commodity price risk the market risks inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments  positions and anticipated commodity transactions are the potential losses in value arising from adverse changes in the company s commodity prices 
the trading activities are conducted throughout the year subject to a daily  monthly and annual trading stop loss limit of million 
the daily loss exposure from trading activities is measured primarily using value at risk as well as other quantitative risk measurement techniques and is limited to million 
these limits are designed to mitigate the possibility of trading activities having a material adverse effect on enogex s operating income 
the prices of natural gas  natural gas liquids  natural gas liquids processing spreads and electricity are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
processing spreads are the difference between the values of natural gas liquids compared to the value of an equivalent amount of mmbtu in natural gas form 
to partially reduce commodity price risk incurred in the company s normal course of business caused by these market fluctuations  the company may hedge  through the utilization of derivatives  a portion of the company s supply and related purchase and sale contracts  as well as any anticipated transactions purchases and sales 
see price risk management assets and liabilities in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special studies other than monitoring the degree of correlation between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the commodity price exposure to the market risk of the company s natural gas  natural gas liquids and electricity commodity positions 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of natural gas inventories  commodity purchase and sales contracts  financial and commodity derivative instruments and anticipated natural gas processing spreads and fuel recoveries 
the fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows for in millions trading non tradin g commodity market risk  net
