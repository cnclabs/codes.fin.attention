remaining mortgages eligible for assignment the partnership s mortgage portfolio includes two fha insured loans eligible under the section program with anniversary dates in september and october  including kaynorth apartments and town park apartments 
the partnership expects these mortgages to be put to hud  if not otherwise disposed  by the servicer during the second quarter of investment in debenture the mortgage on fox run apartments was beneficially owned by the partnership and by aim a debenture  with a face value of approximately million  was issued by hud to the partnership in december with interest payable semi annually on january and july in january  the debenture was liquidated at par value

the mortgage base decreased as a result of mortgage dispositions with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million  representing an approximate decrease in the aggregate principal balance of the total mortgage portfolio since december interest and other income decreased by approximately  for as compared to  primarily due to the timing and amount of the investment of mortgage proceeds prior to the distribution to unitholders 
asset management fees decreased by approximately  for as compared to  primarily due to the reduction in the mortgage base discussed above 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  for as compared to  primarily due to an increase in professional fees

no losses were recognized in compared to net earnings increased slightly for as compared to  primarily due to an increase in net gains from mortgage dispositions  as discussed below  partially offset by a decrease in mortgage investment income of approximately million  primarily due to the reduction in the mortgage base 
the mortgage base decreased as a result of mortgage dispositions with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million  representing an approximate decrease in the aggregate principal balance of the total mortgage portfolio since march interest and other income increased by approximately  for as compared to  primarily due to the timing of the investment of mortgage proceeds prior to the distribution to unitholders 
asset management fees decreased by approximately  for as compared to  primarily due to the reduction in the mortgage base 
gains on mortgage dispositions increased by approximately million for as compared to as a result of gains recognized on seven mortgage prepayments and five mortgage assignments in  as discussed above  compared to gains recognized on four mortgage prepayments and one assignment in no losses were recognized in compared to loss recognized on one mortgage prepayment in liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  are the partnership s principal sources of cash flows  and were sufficient for the years ended december   and to meet operating expense requirements 
the partnership anticipates its cash flows will be sufficient to meet operating expense requirements for the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions  if any  and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages 
although the partnership s insured mortgages pay a fixed monthly mortgage payment  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market in which the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base resulting from monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages  the timing of receipt of debentures  the interest rate on debentures and debenture redemptions  and changes in the partnership s operating expenses 
as the partnership continues to liquidate its mortgage investments and unitholders receive distributions of return of capital and taxable gains  unitholders should expect a reduction in earnings and distributions due to the decreasing mortgage base 
since the partnership is obligated to distribute the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales and insurance on insured mortgages as defined in the partnership agreement to its unitholders  the size of the partnership s portfolio will continue to decrease 
the magnitude of the decrease will depend upon the size of the insured mortgages which are prepaid  sold or assigned for insurance proceeds 
cash flow compared to net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately  in compared to  primarily due to lower mortgage investment income resulting from a reduction in the mortgage base  partially offset by a decrease in receivables and other assets 
the decrease in receivables and other assets is primarily due to the receipt of principal and interest previously accrued on the mortgages awaiting assignment from hud under the section program during  as previously discussed 
net cash provided by investing activities increased by approximately million in compared to this increase is primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from mortgage assignments as discussed above and the net proceeds from the debentures  as discussed above  partially offset by a decrease in proceeds received from the prepayment of mortgages as discussed above 
net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately million in compared to due to a reduction in the amount of distributions paid to partners in compared to cash flow compared to net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million in compared to  primarily due to the reduction in mortgage investment income  as discussed above 
net cash provided by investing activities increased by approximately million in compared to this increase is primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from mortgage prepayments 
net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately million in compared to due to a reduction in the amount of distributions paid to partners in compared to critical accounting policies the partnership s significant accounting polices are described in note to the financial statements 
the partnership believes its most critical accounting policy a critical accounting policy being one that is both very important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments is the determination of fair value of insured mortgages 
fair value of insured mortgages the partnership estimates the fair value of its insured mortgages internally 
the partnership uses a discounted cash flow methodology to estimate the fair value 
this requires the partnership to make certain estimates regarding discount rates and expected prepayments 
the cash flows were discounted using a discount rate that  in the partnership s view  was commensurate with the market s perception of risk and value 
the partnership used a variety of sources to determine its discount rate including i institutionally available research reports  and ii communications with dealers and active insured mortgage security investors regarding the valuation of comparable securities 
increases in the discount rate used by the partnership would generally result in a corresponding decrease in the fair value of the partnership s insured mortgages 
decreases in the discount rate used by the partnership would generally result in a corresponding increase in the fair value of the partnership s insured mortgages 
the partnership also makes certain assumptions regarding the prepayment speeds of its insured mortgages 
in a low interest rate environment  mortgages are more likely to prepay even if the mortgage contains prepayment penalties 
in general  if the partnership increases its assumed prepayment speed  the fair value of the insured mortgages will decrease 
if the partnership decreases its assumed prepayment speed  the fair value of the insured mortgages will increase 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin no 
explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
fin no 
is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the partnership does not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the partnership s principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates in the us treasury market 
the partnership will experience fluctuations in the market value of its assets related to i changes in the interest rates of us treasury securities  ii changes in the spread between the interest rates on us treasury securities and the interest rates on the partnership s insured mortgages  and iii changes in the weighted average life of the insured mortgages  determined by reviewing the attributes of the insured mortgages in relation to the current market interest rates 
the weighted average life of the insured mortgages decreased as of december  compared to december   due to the lower market interest rates  which may imply faster prepayment rates  and other attributes of the partnership s insured mortgages 
the partnership has changed its method of presenting market risk disclosures from those disclosures presented in the december  annual report on form k 
the partnership believes that the market risk disclosures presented below provide more meaningful information to its unitholders in assessing the affect of changes in interest rates on the values of its assets 
as of december   the weighted average life of the us treasury securities that were used to value the insured mortgage securities were shorter than those used at december  due to lower market interest rates and other loan attributes of the underlying insured mortgage securities  which made the likelihood of the mortgage assets prepaying greater than the previous year 
if the partnership assumed that the discount rate used to determine the fair values of its insured mortgage securities increased by basis points and basis points  the increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair values of its insured mortgage securities by approximately million or and approximately million or  respectively  as of december  a basis point and basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair values of the partnership s insured mortgage securities by approximately million or and approximately million or  respectively  as of december
