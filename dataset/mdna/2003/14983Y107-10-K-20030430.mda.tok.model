the company is provided a safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in this report by the private securities litigation reform act of the company may discuss forward looking information in this report such as its expectations for future performance  growth and acquisition strategies  liquidity and capital needs and its future prospects 
actual results may not necessarily develop as the company anticipates due to many factors including  but not limited to the timing of certain transactions  unexpected expenses encountered  the effect of economic and market conditions  the impact of competition and the factors listed in item business description risk factors 
because of these and other reasons  the company s actual results may vary materially from management s current expectations 
overview the consolidated financial statements of the company including all related notes  which appear elsewhere in this report  should be read in conjunction with this discussion of the company s results of operations and its liquidity and capital resources 
discontinued operations on december   we made a strategic decision to dispose of our air delivery business and accordingly have restated the accompanying balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows to reflect such as discontinued operations 
on march   we consummated a transaction providing for the sale of certain assets and liabilities of sureway air traffic corporation  inc sureway  our air delivery business 
the selling price for the net assets was approximately  and was comprised of  in cash  a subordinated promissory note the note receivable for  and contingent cash payments based upon the ultimate development of certain liabilities retained by us 
the note receivable originally bore interest at the rate of per annum  with interest only payable in monthly installments 
the entire balance of principal  plus all accrued interest  was due and payable on march  as of december  collection of the note receivable  interest accrued thereon and certain other related receivables was in doubt 
accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax charge of  included in other expense  net in the fourth quarter of to write off the note receivable 
additionally  the company recorded a pre tax charge of  included in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of to write off certain other direct expenses incurred on behalf of sureway subsequent to march  for which collection was in doubt and to true up certain accruals that were estimated in relative to the disposition of sureway 
the company reported net losses of   and  from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively including provisions for losses on the disposition of the assets of the company s air delivery business  net of benefit for income taxes of   and  of   and  respectively 
in february  the company became obligated for seller financed acquisition debt of  related to the acquisition of gold wings see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of february   the note had a remaining principal balance of approximately  the cdl gold note 
on february   the company completed a series of related transactions with gmv express  inc gmv  richard gold a principal of gmv gold and his affiliates  and global delivery systems llc global and its subsidiary  sureway worldwide llc sureway worldwide 
the net effect of the transactions with global  sureway worldwide  gmv and gold is that the company assigned the note receivable to gmv in exchange for a release on the cdl gold note payable  so that the company is now relieved of its  liability for the cdl gold note and the company has no further rights to the note receivable 
in addition  the company received payments from sureway worldwide and global of approximately   in settlement of disputed claims and  for other amounts due and provided gold with a release covering claims of breach of certain non competition agreements 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded a gain of approximately  in the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts and notes receivable  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers and debtors to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
the company estimates allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable by evaluating past due aging trends  analyzing customer payment histories and assessing market conditions relating to its customers operations and financial condition 
such allowances are developed principally for specific customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers and debtors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company interprets the timing of revenue recognition to be when services are rendered to customers  and expenses are recognized as incurred 
this policy applies to all of the company s same day  time critical delivery service options  including rush  scheduled  facilities management and dedicated contract logistics 
certain customers pay in advance  giving rise to deferred revenue 
goodwill the value of the company s goodwill is significant relative to total assets and stockholders equity 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis using several fair value based tests  which include  among others  a discounted cash flow and terminal value computation 
the discounted cash flow and terminal value computation is based on management s estimates of future operations 
changes in business conditions could materially impact management s estimates of future operations and this could result in an impairment of goodwill 
such impairment  if any  could have a significant impact on the company s operations and financial condition 
examples of changes in business conditions include  but are not limited to  bankruptcy or loss of a significant customer  a significant adverse change in regulatory factors  a loss of key personnel  increased levels of competition from companies with greater financial resources than the company and margin erosion caused by our inability to increase prices to our customers at the same rate that our costs increase 
insurance reserves the company maintains certain insurance risk through insurance policies with a  deductible for workers compensation and automobile liability  prior to july  and a  deductible for employee health medical costs  prior to march  
the company reserves the estimated amounts of uninsured claims and deductibles related to such insurance retentions for claims that have occurred in the normal course of business 
these reserves are established by management based upon the recommendations of third party administrators who perform a specific review of open claims  which include fully developed estimates of both reported claims and incurred but not reported claims  as of the balance sheet date 
actual claim settlements may differ materially from these estimated reserve amounts 
income taxes the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
results of operations compared with the following discussion compares the year ended december  and the year ended december   for continuing operations 
income and expense as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december  revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment depreciation and amortization other expense  net interest expense income loss from continuing operations revenue for the year ended december  decreased  or  to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease included approximately  in lost revenue due to the sale of the company s mid west operations on june  all other revenue increased by  or 
cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to employee drivers and independent contractors  agents  other direct pick up and delivery costs and the costs of dispatching drivers and messengers 
these costs decreased  or  from  for to  in stated as a percentage of revenue  these costs increased to for compared to for excluding the  reduction due to the sale of the company s mid west operations  cost of revenue increased  or 
this reflects increased direct messenger and driver costs of  and higher workers compensation and vehicle insurance of  these cost increases were partially offset by the favorable impact on vehicle lease and operating costs of  due to a reduction in company owned vehicles and decreased uninsured product related claims and other costs of  as a result of the above  gross profit decreased by  from  in to  in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased to in compared to in selling  general and administrative expense sg a includes costs incurred at the terminal level related to taking orders and administrative costs related to such functions

sg a expense was favorably impacted by reduced staffing costs of  lower facility and communication costs of  lower bad debt expense of  and  in grants received related to the events of september  these were partially offset by increased general insurance expenses of  and net increases of  of other expense 
there was no goodwill impairment for compared to  for the charge taken in was the result of a comprehensive review of the company s intangible assets under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
in  as a result of recording significant losses on the dispositions of sureway and the mid west operations and as a result of inadequate cash flows from certain acquired businesses due to the loss of customers  the company determined that the carrying amount of certain assets might not be fully recoverable 
the measurement of impairment losses recognized in is based on the difference between the fair values  which were calculated based upon the present value of projected future cash flows  and the carrying amounts of the assets 
depreciation and amortization decreased by  or  from  for to  for the decrease was primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas  as discussed below 
in addition  other factors driving such reduction was the full depreciation of certain vehicles held under a capital lease that ended during and reduced capital expenditures in  and on june   sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas was issued 
sfas eliminates goodwill amortization over its estimated useful life 
however  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  acquired intangible assets must be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
intangible assets with definitive lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the statement requires that by june   a company must establish its fair value benchmarks in order to test for impairment 
the company adopted sfas effective january  for purposes of performing the fair value based test of goodwill  the company has determined that it has one reporting unit 
this reporting unit is consistent with its single operating segment  which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
during  a transitional goodwill impairment test was performed and the company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
further  as required by sfas  an annual impairment test was completed at the end of fiscal and the company determined that there was no impairment 
fair value was determined by two methods present value of future estimated cash flows  including a determination of a terminal value 
market capitalization utilizing quoted market prices of the company s common stock 
the adoption of sfas did not result in an impairment of goodwill 
however  changes in business conditions could result in an impairment in the future 
such impairment  if any  could have a significant impact on the company s operations and financial condition 
examples of changes in business conditions include  but are not limited to  bankruptcy or loss of a significant customer  a significant adverse change in regulatory factors  a loss of key personnel  increased levels of competition from companies with greater financial resources than the company and margin erosion caused by our inability to increase prices to our customers at the same rate that our costs increase 
adoption of sfas increased pretax earnings by approximately  for the year ended december  due to the cessation of goodwill amortization 
other expense decreased by  to  in from  in the expense includes a  increase in the allowance for the shareholder note receivable 
the expense is primarily due to two transactions 
as of december   the company wrote off the note receivable received on march  amounting to  in the transaction to dispose of certain assets and liabilities of sureway  as collection of the note receivable  interest accrued thereon and certain other related receivables was in doubt 
the company also recorded a  loss on the sale of all of the outstanding stock in national express  inc the company s ground courier operation in the mid west on june  the selling price of the stock was approximately  and was comprised of  in cash and a subordinated promissory note the promissory note for  the promissory note originally bore interest at the rate of per annum 
the promissory note  as amended on march   allows for the deferral of the interest and principal payments due on december  and march  a new quarterly payment schedule will commence on june  with interest only payments at a new interest rate at per annum 
upon the earlier of june  or the maker of the promissory note meeting certain financial benchmarks  principal payments shall resume and the interest rate will prospectively revert back to per annum 
the final balloon payment of approximately  plus any remaining principal or unpaid interest remains due on june  interest expense decreased by  from  in to  in the decrease is primarily attributable to decreased debt 
total debt was  lower at december  compared to december  principal payments of  and  on the senior subordinated notes and seller financed debt  respectively  comprised the majority of the debt reduction

as a result of a portfolio review  contracts with certain customers that had unacceptable profit margins were given notice of rate increases 
if the rate increases were not accepted  the contracts were terminated 
this revenue loss was partially offset by the effect of fuel surcharges and price increases implemented throughout that remained in effect for cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to employee drivers and independent contractors  agents  other direct pick up and delivery costs and the costs of dispatching drivers and messengers

management believes that cash flows from operations and its borrowing capacity  after the debt modifications referred to above  are sufficient to support the company s operations and general business and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
such conclusions are predicated upon sufficient cash flow from operations and the continued availability of a revolving credit facility 
the risks associated with cash flow from operations are mitigated by the company s low gross profit margin 
unless catastrophic  decreases in revenue should be accompanied by corresponding decreases in costs  resulting in minimal impact to liquidity 
the risks associated with the revolving credit facility are as discussed above
