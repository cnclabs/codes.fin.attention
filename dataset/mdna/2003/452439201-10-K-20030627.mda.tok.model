international wholesale distribution international sublicensing 
image has a dvd sublicense agreement with bmg music international service  gmbh bmg for the exclusive distribution of image s video programming  primarily dvd  throughout europe except france and spain  until existing subdistribution agreements expire june and december   respectively  the middle east excluding israel and turkey and africa 
the agreement contains terms and conditions similar to those governing image s underlying rights agreements 
bmg pays image a royalty on wholesale revenues it generates and is responsible for all sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of image s programming in the territories 
for distribution to a large portion of the remainder of the world  image currently has similar sublicenses with other third parties 
our international wholesale distribution segment activities were previously handled by aviva  and our dvd programming was previously distributed internationally through a network of independent subdistributors 
see note aviva international  llc to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
worldwide broadcast 
buyers of image s broadcast rights are typically cable  pay per view  video on demand or satellite broadcasters  and sometimes terrestrial free television or in flight broadcasters 
with the exception of pay per view and video on demand  under a typical broadcast license we receive payment of a one time  fixed  non refundable fee for a multi year exploitation term and in many instances for a specified number of airings 
with respect to pay per view and video on demand  we typically receive a non refundable advance against royalties that are based on a percentage of customer buys 
our obligations under broadcast licensing are usually only to provide a broadcast master of the program and to ensure that all music synchronization rights are secured 
image has a sales agency agreement with london based nbd television ltd nbd to represent image as its exclusive sales agent for worldwide broadcast television sublicenses of the majority of the current catalogue of programming for which image holds broadcast rights in excess of programs as well as image s new release acquisitions which feature broadcast rights 
nbd represents image for conventional television broadcast sales  including cable  pay per view and video on demand  satellite television  and sales to non theatrical venues 
internet rights video on demand via the internet  digital downloading and streaming are excluded from the nbd agreement 
programs that were sublicensed to third parties for broadcast prior to january will be handled by nbd upon the expiration of the existing licenses 
historically  aviva acted as image s sales agent to secure broadcast rights sublicenses both domestically and internationally 
see note aviva international  llc to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
competition with respect to our ability to sell our exclusive product  our foremost competition is from the major motion picture studios  fox  universal  disney  columbia tri star  warner  mgm and dreamworks  the mini majors artisan and new line  major music labels wea  bmg  universal and sony and other independent suppliers with sales models and structures similar to image 
we compete with these other program suppliers for limited open to buy dollars  retail shelf space and consumer dollars spent on home entertainment products 
most of these studios and labels are subsidiaries of media conglomerates that have far greater financial resources than we do 
however  image as an independent program supplier  can offer its licensors unique and specialized products  as well as highly focused marketing campaigns for titles that may otherwise be deemed too small by the major studios or may be neglected by a corporate conglomerate 
as the dvd industry matures  with penetration of us television households nearing  and new space being allocated for dvd programming  the competition level will continue to rise 
the major studios remain consistent and prolific in their ability to bring new theatrical programming to retailers 
they have large libraries of classic programming to release on dvd 
new independent suppliers are continually emerging  further adding to the competition 
the additional promotional opportunities and open to buy dollars  while greater now than ever before  may be severely compromised by the new major theatrical programming  new independent suppliers and the vast catalog libraries from the major studios 
our exclusive programming competes for a finite amount of shelf space  against a growing supply of entertainment programming 
dvdplanet faces competition from online and traditional retailers  including mail order houses  video clubs and retail stores 
online dvd retailers now compete with a wide spectrum of retailers from mass merchants and other online retailers to supermarkets all of which offer a wide selection of dvds  often at loss leader prices 
additionally  online dvd retailers compete with the growing popularity of online rental by mail providers 
according to video store magazine  more than web sites offering dvd rental by mail have entered the marketplace since  including recent entry wal mart 
image faces competition in securing exclusive license and distribution rights from other independent distribution companies as well as major motion picture studios and music labels 
historically  we have paid significant up front advances against future royalties and distribution fees to secure exclusive dvd and other home entertainment format distribution rights 
our procedures designed to ensure timely recoupment of advances limit the amount of advances we are willing to pay to secure certain rights 
we may not be able to remain competitive against advance offers from licensing and other acquisition entities who are willing to pay larger advances or have greater financial resources 
however  we believe that we will continue to successfully compete in obtaining exclusive rights to home entertainment programming because of our ability to offer an array of other assets to our program suppliers including  but not limited to the high quality of expertise and the service our employees provide  our superior reputation within the home entertainment industry  our notable ability to obtain and sustain ongoing relationships with valuable suppliers of entertainment programming  the quality of our finished product  our wide ranging in house services and our direct and long standing relationships with traditional and online retailers of entertainment programming 
finally  management believes that image s status as an independent program supplier capable of exploiting programming in all home entertainment and broadcast formats on a worldwide basis is attractive to potential licensors thereby making the company a leading one stop provider of entertainment rights exploitation

risk factors forward looking statements 
this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these include statements regarding our intent  belief and current expectations about the company s strategic direct  prospective and future results 
in some cases forward looking statements may be identified by words like may  should  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  continue  or similar words 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that are inherently difficult to predict  which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from our expectations  forecasts and assumptions 
the company has made forward looking statements in this item and subsequent items including but not limited to item of this annual report concerning  among other things changes in company wide or business unit strategies  which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which the company is involved or chooses to invest  changes in us and global financial and equity markets  including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations  which may impede the company s access to  or increase the cost of  external financing for its operations and investments  increased competitive pressures  both domestically and internationally  which may  among other things  affect the performance of the company s business operations and profit margins  legal and regulatory developments that may affect internet activities or the protection of intellectual property  the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions on motion picture or television content requirements or quotas  and changes in international tax laws or currency controls  the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions on motion picture or television content requirements or quotas  and changes in international tax laws or currency controls  technological developments that may affect the distribution of the company s products or create new risks to the company s ability to protect its intellectual property  and changing public and consumer taste  which may among other things  affect the entertainment and consumer products businesses generally 
this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements is illustrative  but by no means exhaustive 
accordingly  all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of inherent uncertainty 
the inclusion of such forward looking information should not be regarded as a representation by the company  its management or any other person that the future events  plans or expectations contemplated by the company will be achieved 
unless otherwise required by law  the company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any such forward looking statements that may reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report 
important factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those described under the heading competition above 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of their dates 
we further caution you that the matters set forth below constitute cautionary statements with respect to our forward looking statements  including risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  our forward looking statements 
any of the matters set forth below could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
cautionary statements relating to our business in general 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological advances 
the entertainment industry in general  and the music and motion picture industries in particular  are continuing to undergo significant changes  primarily due to technological developments 
as an independent distributor  image believes we have a superior ability to adapt to changing formats and distribution methods  as we did when shifting our focus from laserdiscs to dvds  and that our high quality customer service and loyal customer base will continue to purchase programming from image through new distribution methods 
however  because of the rapid growth of technology  shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment  it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors will have on potential revenue from and profitability of distributing entertainment programming  or the company s ability to compete effectively in a changing market 
if we cannot maintain relationships with our program suppliers and vendors  our business may be adversely affected 
we receive a significant amount of our revenue from the distribution of those dvds for which we have exclusive agreements with program suppliers 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew these exclusive rights as existing agreements with program suppliers expire 
we also cannot assure you that our current program suppliers will continue to support the dvd format in accordance with our exclusive agreements  that our current program suppliers will continue to license titles to us on the current terms or on terms favorable to us  or that we will be able to establish new supplier relationships to ensure acquisition of exclusive titles in a timely and efficient manner 
our success depends on the unpredictable commercial success of our programming 
operating in the entertainment industry involves a substantial degree of risk 
each music performance  feature film or other programming title is an individual artistic work  and unpredictable audience reactions primarily determine commercial success 
the commercial success of a title also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs or titles released into the marketplace  critical reviews  the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  all of which are subject to change and cannot be predicted with certainty 
our success will depend in part on the popularity of our programming 
even if a film achieves success during its theatrical release  the popularity of a particular program and its ratings may diminish over time and may have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
others failure to promote our programming may adversely affect our business 
decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support of programming which we license and distribute are important in determining the success of a particular music concert  feature film or related product 
we may not control the manner in which a particular artist  film or related product is marketed and promoted  and we may not be able to fully control our corresponding home video or cd release 
although artists  record companies  studios and producers have a financial interest in the success of any such concerts or films distributed by image  any marketing or promotional decision or restriction by such persons may negatively affect the success of our titles 
if dvd cannot compete successfully with other formats of home entertainment  our revenues may be negatively impacted 
the dvd format competes with other formats of in home entertainment  such as vhs  network  syndicated  cable and pay per view television and home satellite systems 
the dvd format also competes with new and emerging technologies in the entertainment industry  such as entertainment programming on the internet  video on demand  high definition television  digital videotape and optical discs with greater storage capacity 
while we are actively seeking to exploit these alternate formats of leisure time entertainment and novel means of content delivery  they could negatively impact the overall market for dvd sales and the company 
in addition  emerging technology may allow consumers to download audio or entertainment programming directly to the consumer s home computer  or television set top recording device  from the internet or other broadband delivery system and store such products on a recordable disc or hard drive 
we may be unable to continue to adapt and exploit the development and advancement of such technology 
dvd sales may not sustain the same level of growth 
we believe that consumer interest in the dvd format is due in part to interest in building the consumer s personal dvd library of desired entertainment programming 
although image s exclusive titles have generally shown stable sales over extended periods  as consumers build their dvd libraries  or with the introduction of new home entertainment formats  dvd sales may decline and adversely affect our operations 
in addition  consumers are increasingly downloading entertainment and computer software directly via the internet 
piracy and unauthorized recording  transmission and distribution of content are increasing challenges 
decreasing retail prices for dvds may negatively impact our revenues 
the home entertainment programming market in which we compete is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
many of our competitors  including major studios  are increasingly offering programming  particularly dvd programming  at lower prices 
they may be able to produce or secure programming on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we are able to do 
also  many of our competitors endeavor to offer our customers the lowest possible prices  and include free or discounted shipping 
while we strive to improve our operating efficiencies and leverage our fixed costs so that we can afford to pass along these savings to our customers in the form of lower prices  the industry trend of lowering prices may  over time  lead to lost sales  decreased profit margins or decreased overall revenues 
we may not possess satisfactory rights in our properties 
although we require satisfactory chain of title information to our exclusively licensed properties  the risk exists that some programs may have a defective chain of title 
the validity and ownership of rights to certain titles can be uncertain and may be contested by third parties 
our results of operations fluctuate based on seasonality and variability 
we have generally experienced higher sales of dvds in the quarters ended december and march due to increased consumer spending associated with the year end holidays 
accordingly  our revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from period to period  and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results of any future periods 
in addition to seasonality issues  other factors have contributed to variability in our dvd net revenues on a quarterly basis 
these factors include the popularity of exclusive titles in release during the quarter  our marketing and promotional activities  our rights and distribution activities  the extension  termination or non renewal of existing license and distribution rights  and general economic changes affecting the buying habits of our customers  particularly those changes affecting consumer demand for home entertainment hardware and software 
if we do not effectively implement our sales and marketing efforts  our profitability may suffer 
we have increased our internal sales staff in order to enhance our sales efforts 
we cannot assure you that our sales team can successfully compete against the more extensive and well funded sales operations of our current and future competitors 
we face risks associated with deluxes s performance under the company s manufacturing services agreement 
any failure of deluxe to manufacture and deliver our product in a timely manner and with the same consistent quantity and quality that we and our customers have come to expect may adversely affect our revenues and profits 
although we believe we have the ability to shift our product manufacturing from deluxe to another facility should the need arise  we may be adversely affected from the period of time that we would need to direct manufacturing duties to another company 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may adversely affect our business 
we maintain insurance to protect ourselves against certain risks related to our operations 
this insurance is maintained in types and amounts that we believe to be reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
however  we may elect to limit coverage or not to carry insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums or rates associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flows and overall profitability 
protecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to compete in the home entertainment industry depends  in part  upon successful protection of our proprietary and intellectual property 
we protect our property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable international companies in specific territories and media for limited durations 
despite these precautions  existing copyright and trademark laws afford only limited practical protection in certain jurisdictions 
in certain jurisdictions of our distribution  there are no copyright and or trademark protections available 
as a result  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions or certain portions or applications of our intended productions 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
from time to time  we may also receive claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
regardless of the validity or the success of the claims  we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against such claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our key personnel leave us  our business may be adversely affected 
our success greatly depends on the performance of our executive management  including the president and chief executive officer  chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
the loss of the services of key persons of our executive management could have an adverse material effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
if we do not successfully optimize and operate our distribution facility  our business could be harmed 
domestic wholesale distribution of our exclusive programming is fulfilled from a single distribution facility in las vegas  nevada 
if we are unable to operate this facility for any reason  it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand 
because it is difficult to predict sales increases or declines  we may not manage our facility in an optimal way  which may result in excess inventory  warehousing and distribution dilemmas 
our failure to properly handle inventory could result in unexpected costs  delays and harm to our business and reputation 
cautionary statements relating to domestic wholesale distribution 
if we cannot continue to secure dvd license and distribution rights  our business may be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to secure dvd and other license and distribution rights on terms acceptable to us 
see competition 
we expect to continue to license exclusive dvd and other home entertainment format programming  but we cannot assure you that we can remain competitive against licensing entities with greater financial resources or that independent program suppliers will not distribute their programming themselves 
in addition  our success will continue to be dependent upon our ability to identify and secure rights to exclusive programming that appeals to consumers 
major motion picture studios have not granted exclusive dvd licenses to image for their new releases and most popular catalogue titles 
instead  the major motion picture studios sell dvd programming directly to retailers 
we may need additional funding to continue acquiring desirable programming 
availability of working capital is a substantial factor in the company s ability to license new programming 
therefore  maximizing available working capital is critical to image s business operations 
we may need to raise additional funds to acquire the rights to programming we find desirable 
should additional funds be raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced 
if adequate funds are not available or unavailable on acceptable terms  we may find we are unable to fund expansion  continue to offer products and services  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  and or respond to competitive pressures in the industry 
if music entertainment programming cannot continue to compete successfully in the home entertainment industry  our business may be adversely affected 
although we make efforts to diversify our exclusive programming  approximately of our revenue generated in fiscal was derived from sales of exclusively licensed and distributed music dvd entertainment programming 
we cannot assure you that the music industry in general will continue to prosper or that music entertainment programming will continue to compete successfully against other home entertainment programming  including but not limited to  film  television  and interactive gaming 
if music programming cannot compete successfully in the home entertainment market  our business may be adversely affected 
cautionary statements relating to retail distribution 
if we cannot compete successfully in the internet commerce industry  our retail sales may be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that the dvdplanet 
com web site will be able to compete successfully against current or future online and traditional retailers 
see competition 
the market for commerce over the internet is evolving and competitive and very few online retailers achieve profitability 
we compete with a variety of other companies for sales of dvds over the internet 
some of these competitors are able to devote substantial resources to internet commerce 
the dvdplanet 
com web site also competes with traditional retailers of dvds 
we believe that the principal competitive factors faced in selling dvds through the dvdplanet 
com web site include price of product  product selection and availability  brand recognition  customer service  effectiveness of advertising  technical expertise  convenience  accessibility  quality of search tools  quality of editorial and site content  and reliability and speed of fulfillment 
some of the current and potential competitors of dvdplanet have large customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than dvdplanet 
in addition  some competitors may be able to obtain merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing or inventory availability policies  and devote more resources to web site systems and development than the company 
the dvdplanet 
com web site could suffer reduced operating margins  market share and brand recognition as a result of increased competition 
if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological change  our retail sales may be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully use new technologies effectively or adapt the dvdplanet 
com web site or its systems to meet customer preferences  requirements or emerging industry standards 
the technology driving internet commerce changes rapidly 
this rapid change results in the availability of many new products and services  new industry standards and frequent changes in user and customer preferences and requirements 
the success of the dvdplanet 
com web site depends  in part  on our ability to do the following license leading technologies useful in the internet revenues business  enhance the dvdplanet 
com web site s existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
if internet commerce does not continue to grow  our internet sales business may be adversely affected 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the world wide web  internet and other online services as media of consumer commerce is a recent phenomenon 
potential future revenues and profits from sales over the internet substantially depend on the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by consumers 
we cannot assure you that the acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will adopt and use the internet as a medium of commerce 
for the dvdplanet 
com web site to be successful  consumers who have historically used traditional means of commerce to purchase merchandise must accept and utilize this novel way of conducting business and exchanging information 
also  if the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users  the frequency of use or larger bandwidth requirements  the infrastructure for the internet could be adversely affected by capacity constraints 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of service activity 
changes in or insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the internet also could result in slower response times and could adversely affect consumer usage of the internet 
our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if use of the internet does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected 
if the infrastructure for the internet does not effectively support growth that may occur or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  we could be adversely affected 
we face security risks in selling product over the internet 
secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a significant barrier to internet commerce 
advances in computer hacker capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could compromise the security measures we employ to protect customer transaction data 
in addition  concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of users in general may inhibit the growth of internet commerce 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate security related problems  and we cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches 
any compromise of our security systems could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  prospects  financial conditions and results of operations 
we may experience capacity constraints and other system development problems relating to the operation of the dvdplanet web site 
a key element of our business strategy is generating a high level of use of the dvdplanet 
com web site 
we believe it is important to our online reputation and the ability to attract customers that the dvdplanet 
com web site offers superior customer service as well as reliability and availability of the related transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
while we believe that we will be able to upgrade or install new hardware and software that will be sufficient to accommodate the anticipated traffic on the dvdplanet 
com web site  we cannot assure you that periodic system interruptions will not occur even after any such upgrade or installation 
any substantial increase in the volume of traffic on the dvdplanet 
com web site or substantial increase in the number of orders placed by customers will require us to further expand and upgrade our technology  including our transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
in addition  we are dependent upon web browser companies and internet service providers to generate traffic to the web site that will allow consumer access to our products and services 
viewers have experienced in the past and may experience in the future difficulties due to system or software failures or incompatibilities not within our control 
any system interruptions that result in the unavailability of the dvdplanet 
com web site or reduced order fulfillment performance would reduce the volume of goods sold and the attractiveness of our online product and service offerings  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
new laws or regulations pertaining to the internet  or the application or interruption of existing laws could adversely affect our business 
we could be materially adversely affected by any new legislation or regulation or by the application or interpretation of existing laws related to the internet 
federal  state and foreign governmental organizations are currently considering many such legislative and regulatory proposals 
if a government authority were to adopt laws or regulations that cover internet related issues such as user privacy  pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services provided  the growth of the internet could be adversely affected 
this could lead to a decrease in demand for products offered over the internet  including those that the dvdplanet 
com web site offers  and could increase the cost of doing business on the internet 
in addition  it is currently unclear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright  trade secret  libel and personal privacy will be applied to the rapidly changing internet landscape 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  but remain largely unsettled

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto and other financial information contained elsewhere in this form k 
general we are an integrated entertainment company  primarily engaged in the business of licensing and distributing home entertainment programming 
we acquire and exploit exclusive rights to a diverse array of general and specialty entertainment programming  such as music concerts  urban and lifestyle documentaries  and feature films  in dvd and other home entertainment formats 
in addition to our current core business of domestic dvd distribution  we also acquire and  in some cases  exploit exclusive broadcast rights  including video on demand  broadband streaming  digital download  pay per view  in flight  radio  satellite  cable and broadcast television 
image primarily acquires programming by entering into exclusive licensing or distribution arrangements with third parties 
we also produce our own original entertainment programming focused on dvd live performance music concerts and urban genre programming 
additionally  we design and produce additional content and value added features for our dvd programming such as interactive menus  audio commentaries  packaging and marketing materials 
although we license and distribute programming across many genres  we are foremost a leading provider of music related dvd programming 
the company s three reportable business segments are domestic wholesale distribution  including program acquisition and production  retail distribution  which distributes programming direct to consumer  and international wholesale distribution  including sublicensing and worldwide broadcast rights exploitation 
management currently analyzes the financial performance of these business segments based primarily on net revenues  operating costs and expenses and income loss before income taxes  to evaluate and allocate company resources 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission s sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the company believes the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company as contemplated by frr decisions involved in our critical accounting policies are based on management s exercise of judgment 
for a summary of all the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
royalty and distribution fee advances and production costs for each reporting period  management estimates the total revenues to be received throughout a title s exclusive license or distribution period from exploitation of that title in multiple home entertainment formats 
while royalty and distribution fee advances and production costs are charged to operations as related revenues are earned  estimates of ultimate revenues are important in determining whether additional royalty and distribution fee expense or amortization of production costs should be recorded as cost of sales in any given reporting period 
royalty and distribution fee advances and production costs are amortized to expense in the same ratio that the current period revenues for a title or group of titles bear to the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenues for that title 
additionally  when estimates of total revenues and costs indicate that a title will result in an ultimate loss  additional amortization is recognized to the extent that capitalized advance royalty and distribution fees and production costs exceed their estimated fair value in the period when estimated 
management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each title on the historical performance of that title and of similar titles 
management updates such estimates based upon the actual results of each format s exploitation 
inventory valuation for each reporting period  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by title and by format and projections of future demand 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our cost or market value and result in a new basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable for each reporting period  management evaluates product sales and accounts receivables to estimate their effect on revenues due to product returns and delinquent accounts 
management s estimate of product sales that will be returned and the amount of receivables that will ultimately be collected requires the exercise of judgment and affects reported revenues and net income 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  management analyzes historical returns  historical pricing and other credit memo data  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of image s products 
based on this information  management reserves a percentage of each dollar of product sales that provides the customer with the right of return as well as the right to take pricing or other credit memo items 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
similarly  management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for image s larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
based on the information  management reserves an amount that is believed to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a and no 
b 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and require management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
to satisfy the criteria  we input orders based upon receipt of a customer purchase order  record revenue upon shipment of goods when risk of loss and title transfer under our arrangements with customers or otherwise complying with the terms of the purchase order in cases in which title does not transfer until the product is received by the customer  revenue is recognized at the time it is received by the customer  confirm pricing through the customer purchase order  and validate creditworthiness through past payment history  credit agency reports and other financial data 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine the revenue recognition criteria are not met for certain future transactions  such as a determination that an outstanding account receivable has become uncollectible  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets at march   we had million of goodwill  accounting for of our total assets 
effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires us to analyze goodwill for impairment upon adoption  and then on at least an annual basis thereafter 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recognized a million impairment charge related to goodwill that is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march  for a further discussion of sfas no 
 see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves our estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
during the year ended march   the company recorded a valuation allowance of  related to foreign tax credits which may not be utilized prior to their expiration 
we believe we currently have the ability to utilize our remaining deferred tax assets before they expire 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates  in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
change in international video distribution in january  image entered into an exclusive five year international dvd sublicense agreement with bertelsmann music information services  gmbh  for the exclusive distribution of image s video programming  primarily dvd  throughout europe  the middle east excluding israel and turkey and africa upon the expiration of image s current international subdistribution agreements 
the agreement was later amended to change the licensing party from bertelsmann music information services gmbh to bmg music international service  gmbh bmg 
image s dvd programming has historically been distributed in europe and south africa through a network of independent subdistributors and studios  including bmg 
the subdistribution terms of all territories expired on march   except france  which will expire june   and spain  which will expire december  bmg will be responsible for all sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of image s programming in the territories 
bmg began releasing image s new release dvd programming in march there were approximately image dvd catalogue titles in release throughout the new bmg sublicense territories 
in april  image and bmg structured a marketing and re release plan focusing on reintroducing image s catalogue programming into the international marketplace under the bmg label 
image received a million royalty advance under the bmg agreement in march  fully recoupable from revenues generated by bmg against quarterly royalties due to image under the agreement 
based upon actual quarterly sales of image programming in the territories  bmg will recoup quarterly royalties from the million previously advanced to image 
bmg will provide additional quarterly royalty advances such that for the first three years of the agreement term  the outstanding royalty advance to image at any given time will be a constant million 
the company used the million initially received to pay down its outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility with wells fargo foothill 
during the first three quarters of the fourth year of the term  bmg will reduce  through recoupment  the outstanding royalty advance to image to million 
once the entire royalty advance is recouped  bmg will continue to pay quarterly royalties to image based on revenue generated 
during the fourth quarter of the fourth year  bmg may recoup the entire remaining balance of million by not re advancing royalties quarterly 
the agreement contains a formula to pay an additional lesser advance at the beginning of the fifth and final year of the term which is to be recouped by bmg during that year 
image must repay any outstanding unrecouped royalty advance within days following the final bmg reporting at the conclusion of bmg s sell off period following the expiration of the five year term 
to facilitate an orderly transition to bmg from our previous network of independent subdistributors  the company contractually elected to purchase any product inventory from our subdistributors including any of their customer returns upon the expiration of their respective terms plus an additional time period to allow for their customer returns rather than allow the subdistributors to exercise a six month nonexclusive sell off period 
under the agreement  bmg has committed to purchase the company s international dvd inventory  which would include any inventory repurchased from the subdistributors  at the company s manufacturing price for disc and case only excluding booklets and inserts 
the company recorded a charge for the three months ended march   to provide for the difference between the ultimate purchase price of the inventory paid or credited to the subdistributors upon the expiration of their respective terms and the manufacturing cost paid to the company by bmg for that inventory 
at march   the company has an accrual for estimated subdistributor returns resulting in a reduction of revenues and gross profit margin of  and  respectively  and accrued for the writedown to bmg purchase cost of the estimated inventory to be returned by the subdistributors representing an incremental charge to cost of sales of  during the fourth quarter ended march  the company s accounting will differ under the bmg agreement because it is a sublicense agreement  rather than the subdistribution agreements previously in place 
under its subdistribution agreements  image recorded net revenues based upon the selling price of its programming sold to its distribution network customers 
image recorded as cost of sales  the actual manufacturing packaging cost  shipping cost  royalties distribution fees and music publishing 
under the bmg agreement  image records royalty income as revenue based upon royalties it receives from bmg 
revenue will be recorded in the period in which the product is sold by bmg 
image will report as cost of goods sold  the royalties or distribution fees it will owe its licensors or program suppliers as calculated against the royalties image receives from bmg 
aviva international  llc our international wholesale distribution segment activities were previously handled by image s owned  joint venture  aviva international  llc aviva 
on december   aviva ceased operations 
see note aviva international  llc to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
change in international broadcast exploitation in january  the company entered into a five year sales agency agreement with london based nbd television ltd nbd 
nbd is the company s exclusive sales agent for worldwide broadcast television sales for the majority of image s current catalogue of broadcast programming in excess of programs and new release broadcast acquisitions 
nbd also represents the company for conventional television broadcast sales including cable  pay per view and video on demand  satellite television  and sales to non theatrical venues 
internet rights are excluded from the agreement including video on demand via the internet and digital downloading and streaming 
program broadcast rights that are currently licensed to other parties will be handled by nbd upon the expiration of the existing licenses 
nbd will retain a percentage based commission and other expenses from the sales it generates on the company s behalf and will remit the balance to the company on a quarterly basis 
change in the company s wholesale distribution of nonexclusive dvd programming over the past several years  the company has placed an increasing corporate focus and emphasis on the growth of image s exclusively licensed and distributed dvd programming  which provides the company with significantly higher margins as compared to the margins for nonexclusive programming 
nonexclusive dvd revenues  excluding sales made to dvdplanet  were approximately million  or  of the company s net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and million  or  of the company s net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  however  of the million in net revenues for fiscal  approximately million was derived from sales made to seven national accounts alliance entertainment  best buy  borders  musicland  tower  trans world  and virgin 
of the million in net revenues for fiscal  approximately million was derived from sales made to the seven national accounts 
these sales were of programming from approximately of the more than nonexclusive lines the company distributes 
these lines of programming come to image from smaller  independent suppliers generally unable to sell direct to these retailers 
image typically receives higher profit margins on these lines of programming in exchange for image s ability to place the programming at these retail accounts 
on june   columbia tristar home entertainment cthe implemented changes to its distribution policies that preclude the company s ability to offer cthe dvd products for resale to the company s customer base  excluding dvdplanet 
on october   warner home video whv implemented similar changes for its product 
the changes to cthe and whv policies were not solely directed at the company  many other wholesale distributors similarly situated as the company were also affected 
the company believes that the new policies implemented by cthe and whv were a result of wholesale consolidation trends within the video industry and that other major studios may adopt similar changes to their distribution policies 
in light of these changes and for the other reasons discussed below  the company stopped serving as a wholesale distributor for the majority of nonexclusive programming  effective at the end of the company s fiscal third quarter ended december  however  as a requested service to the seven national accounts noted above  the company currently continues to act as a distributor for about lines of smaller independent programming to these accounts 
management believes that ending wholesale distribution of nonexclusive programming with the exception of nonexclusive sales made to our seven national accounts  which accounted for approximately million in net revenues at an average gross profit margin for fiscal and accounted for approximately million in net revenues at an average gross profit margin in fiscal  will empower the company s sales team to focus on increasing sales of image s exclusive higher margin programming 
management believes that increased higher margin sales have the potential to offset the gross profit loss from the lost sales of lower margin nonexclusive product 
in an effort to maximize this potential  the company reorganized its sales department during the third quarter ended december  as a result of this new strategy the company will carry less lower margin producing inventory and will no longer distribute this programming to the company s customer base 
management believes it has the potential to realize reduced inventory carrying costs  cost efficiencies in its warehousing and distribution operations and other benefits in the future 
consumer fulfillment agreement on june   the company entered into a fulfillment and customer service services agreement with i serve direct commerce services  inc i serve  a wholly owned subsidiary of infinity resources  inc the term of the agreement is three years from the date of the first shipment which occurred in june prior to i serve  image fulfilled for dvdplanet out of its las vegas  nevada warehouse and distribution facility 
under the terms of the agreement  i serve will provide all consumer fulfillment for dvdplanet from its warehousing and distribution facility in illinois 
i serve will also manage all customer returns processing 
dvdplanet will continue to be the primary obligor on all transactions and continue to have the following responsibilities with respect to its internet operations dvdplanet 
com web site operations  sales to its internet customers through its dvdplanet 
com web site  consumer billing and collection credit card processing  and customer service responsibilities 
i serve will ship products out of its warehouse and distribution center pursuant to orders received by dvdplanet and bill dvdplanet per shipment on a cost of goods basis plus fees which cover product receiving and storage  pick  pack  sort and ship  packaging  labels and inventory management system expenses 
i serve will also charge dvdplanet a monthly product sourcing fulfillment administration services fee which cover product forecasts  product ordering  vendor records maintenance  sales and inventory monitoring etc under the terms of the agreement  i serve will purchase both image and dvdplanet s existing nonexclusive inventories up to a combined million at approximately the company s recorded actual cost 
i serve will pay for the purchase in six approximately equal monthly installments 
i serve will utilize the purchased inventory to fulfill sales first out of this inventory rather than their own inventory for dvdplanet 
com  i serve s own web sites  deepdiscountdvd 
com  criticschoicevideo 
com and digitaleyes 
net  and its own catalog business  critics choice video 
if inventory remains on january   i serve may require that the company repurchase it at the cost originally paid by i serve to acquire it from the company 
i serve also fulfills some of dvdplanet s retail store nonexclusive product needs 
should dvdplanet later choose  i serve has the ability to provide customer service services at an additional fee 
after this transaction and after image returns any remaining nonexclusive product back to its suppliers  neither image nor dvdplanet 
com will physically carry and offer for sale nonexclusive product inventory 
the only exceptions are the approximate lines of programming image will continue to carry as discussed above 
currently  i serve inventories music cds for its deepdiscountcd 
com web site 
this will allow dvdplanet to initiate selling cds from the dvdplanet 
com web site in the near future 
management believes the company  on a consolidated basis  should benefit from operational and space efficiencies from carrying approximately  titles rather than approximately  titles and lower labor costs 
image is currently leasing vacant land adjacent to its las vegas distribution facility for future expansion purposes at  per year 
for additional cost savings  management is exploring options to terminate the lease 
on a consolidated basis  management expects to save up to  in annual operational expenses including overtime  temporary labor and other distribution related expenses 
management further believes that expected gross profit margin from potential future cd sales could offset incremental fulfillment charges paid to i serve 
changes at dvdplanet personnel 
in november  dvdplanet terminated its employment agreement with general manager and vice president  ken crane  jr 
image accrued a charge of  for compensation  including estimated bonus  due over the remainder of the agreement term as of the date of termination 
the provision is classified as a component of selling expenses for fiscal effective july   image hired paul ramaker for the newly created position of president of dvdplanet 
prior to joining dvdplanet  mr 
ramaker served as vice president of merchandising for the wherehouse music chain  previously holding executive positions with dvdexpress 
com and the musicland group 
mr 
ramaker is overseeing all day to day activities of dvdplanet s internet and retail store operations 
operational initiatives 
in conjunction with image s management  mr 
ramaker has performed a detailed review of dvdplanet s operations in an effort to increase revenues  increase gross margins  increase operational efficiencies and reduce operating costs 
initiatives that were implemented during the fiscal third quarter ended december  included a reduction in personnel costs needed to effectively manage dvdplanet s retail store and customer service operations  a reduction in online advertising expenditures and the securing of co op and market development funds from dvdplanet s product suppliers 
management believes these initiatives should benefit dvdplanet s future operational results in the form of reduced operational costs and higher gross margins 
however  the current internet retailing trend of increased price discounting of pre ordered new dvd releases and free shipping offers may potentially offset the gross margin benefit of market development funds dvdplanet may receive from its product suppliers  should dvdplanet further reduce its internet pricing 
online promotion 
dvdplanet has an established internet affiliate program whereby other web sites refer customers to the dvdplanet site and in return receive a fee based on sales generated from to that referral 
dvdplanet partnered with be free  inc www 
befree 
com  in an effort to focus dvdplanet s program on targeted affiliates  to increase sales volume and to improve dvdplanet s share of affiliate business 
dvdplanet provides customers with weekly email updates on new product releases and sponsor promotions at other entertainment content web sites 
dvdplanet implemented a review of all internet marketing programs in the second half of fiscal it was determined that the advertising expenditures in this channel  excluding the affiliate program  did not generate an acceptable return on investment 
all programs have been either discontinued or restructured to provide both improved return on investment and greater ability to adapt to changes in the business climate 
radio advertising 
beginning in late november  dvdplanet began an ongoing radio advertising campaign 
the radio campaign utilizes los angeles based radio stations with a focus on driving sales at the dvdplanet retail store 
throughout the continuing period of radio advertising  revenues for the retail store have shown favorable growth as a result of the advertising 
the retail store has registered many new accounts and the online business has generated new accounts that customers attributed to dvdplanet s radio advertising 
print media 
dvdplanet purchased print advertising in the rd and th quarters of fiscal these purchases were funded in part with advertising support funds collected from dvdplanet s major studio partners 
eight page circulars were distributed to dvdplanet customers via direct mail and in sunday editions of the orange county register 
new retail location 
in september  dvdplanet entered into a lease for approximately  square feet located in a shopping center in huntington beach  california 
the new location benefits from a more efficient floor plan for a retail store than did our previous westminster  california retail location 
the term of the new lease is five years commencing january  with two five year options to extend the term 
minimum monthly rent is approximately  and image commenced monthly rent payments on the lease in january dvdplanet received a tenant improvement allowance of  from the landlord  which dvdplanet amortizes as a reduction to rent expense over the initial term of the lease 
dvdplanet is responsible for its pro rata share of common area insurance  property taxes and maintenance costs  currently estimated to be approximately  per month 
the new dvdplanet location was open and operational in february dvdplanet s westminster location was closed february   a day prior to the opening of the new huntington beach location

net revenues for our domestic wholesale distribution segment for the fiscal year increased to  from net revenues of  for the fiscal year 
management believes this segment s revenue performance was positively impacted by the growing popularity of the dvd format 
the growing dvd market coupled with wholesale and retail acceptance of our growing catalogue of exclusive dvd programming contributed to the increase in segment net revenues 
the segment experienced its growth primarily through sales of programming under exclusive distribution agreements 
revenues from exclusively distributed programming increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal management believes that future revenue growth will be primarily dependent upon image s ability to continue to acquire desirable new exclusive programming and to renew existing exclusive license and distribution agreements upon their expiration 
additionally  competition for retail shelf space could limit the levels of our future revenue growth 
see item business competition 
net revenues for dvdplanet  our retail distribution segment  for the fiscal year ended march  increased to  from net revenues of  for the prior fiscal year 
net revenues from internet distribution increased to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal management believes dvdplanet also benefited from the growing popularity of the dvd format 
management believes dvdplanet s competition  which continues to offer aggressive pre order pricing and free shipping in selected instances  has limited dvdplanet s growth 
shipping fees charged customers totaled  for fiscal  up from  for fiscal growing competition from a wide spectrum of dvd retailers  online retailers and rental retailers including a growing presence online has also limited dvdplanet s growth 
revenues generated by the retail store were up  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal  primarily as a result of its radio advertising campaign 
dvdplanet moved its retail location from westminster  california to huntington beach  california in february management believes that the larger location will be more efficient in terms of size  product layout and merchandising 
management expects the new location to ultimately provide for increased revenues from the store 
net revenues for our international wholesale distribution segment for the fiscal year ended march  were down to  from net revenues of  for the fiscal year ended march  for fiscal and  revenues of approximately  and  respectively  were derived from international wholesale distribution of image s licensed dvd and vhs programming  either through european subdistribution or international sublicenses 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  revenues of approximately  and  respectively  were derived from international and domestic broadcast exploitation of the image s licensed programming 
the reduction in comparative fiscal revenues was due to additional sales returns reserves recorded for estimated subdistributor returns totaling  as a result of the change in method of international distribution 
see change in international video distribution 
our transition from european subdistribution to sublicensed european distribution will initially result in reduced top line revenues 
under the new sublicense agreement with bmg  we will report as top line revenue  the royalty income we receive from bmg 
bmg will distribute our selected exclusive programming throughout europe 
prior to the bmg sublicense arrangement  we sold our exclusive programming directly to a network of european subdistributors 
revenue was recognized based on the selling price to our customers  net of market development funds provided to these customers 
management believes that the resources of bmg s european sales force should provide a more efficient and coordinated marketing effort throughout europe with respect to our exclusive dvd programming 
management further believes we are now better positioned for our exclusive dvd programming to benefit from the growth in popularity of dvd in europe  which we believe lags the us in growth by one to two years 
we continue to sublicense our exclusive programming internationally to other territories of the world 
we have also transitioned from distributing our broadcast rights through aviva and our own internal sales personnel to using nbd as its exclusive worldwide sales agent 
management s goal of this transition is to have the experienced and coordinated sales force of nbd maximize the revenue potential of our catalogue of broadcast rights

the following tables present consolidated cost of sales by reportable business segment and as a percentage of related segment net revenues for the fiscal years ended march   and fiscal years ended march  in thousands cost of sales domestic wholesale distribution retail distribution international wholesale distribution consolidated change as a percentage of segment net revenues domestic wholesale distribution retail distribution international wholesale distribution consolidated consolidated cost of sales for fiscal was  or of net revenues  compared to  or of net revenues  for fiscal accordingly  consolidated gross profit margins were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
several factors leading to the decrease in consolidated gross profit margin are addressed below 
in general  our cost of sales  as a percentage of net revenues  will vary from period to period depending on the mix of revenue recognized from various distribution formats and other factors 
revenues that typically generate the highest gross profit margins are from domestic distribution of exclusively licensed programming 
international distribution of exclusive programming has typically generated somewhat lower gross profit margins due to lower international selling prices for dvd and vhs programming as compared to the us revenues from non licensed exclusively distributed programming also generate lower gross profit margins than exclusively licensed programming 
revenues recognized from international sublicense of video programming and revenues recognized from domestic and international broadcast also generate lower gross profit margins than direct distribution of exclusive video programming due to normally higher royalty rates specific to those revenues 
revenues that generate the company s lowest gross profit margins are from nonexclusive distribution of video programming 
gross margins for the domestic wholesale distribution segment  as a percentage of segment revenues  decreased by to for fiscal  from for fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin was due to a higher percentage of segment revenues derived from exclusively distributed programming which generates comparatively lower gross profit margins than our distribution of exclusively licensed programming during fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  the segment s gross profit margins were lower due to increased charges to cost of sales accelerated amortization of royalty advances and distribution fee advances as a result of lower ultimate revenue forecasts for some of our exclusive dvd and vhs titles 
for comparative purposes  fiscal segment gross profit margin included a credit of  or a benefit to gross profit margin of for eliminated reserves related to the discontinuation of our domestic laserdisc distribution operations 
gross margins for the retail distribution segment slightly improved by to for fiscal  from for fiscal although dvdplanet s gross profit margin remained consistent  market pricing trends are placing downward pressure on internet revenue related gross profit margins 
dvdplanet has experienced a shift in sales mix toward higher discounted pre ordered new dvd releases 
offsetting these greater discounts  on a gross profit margin basis  are increased levels of market development funds provided by product suppliers which are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales to dvdplanet 
management believes the current internet retailing trend of increased price discounting of pre ordered new dvd releases and free shipping offers will continue for the foreseeable future 
to the extent dvdplanet further reduces its internet pricing to meet its competition  its gross profit margins on internet sales will be negatively impacted in the future  potentially offsetting the gross margin benefit of receiving market development funds from its product suppliers 
gross margins for the international wholesale distribution segment increased by to for fiscal  from for fiscal in fiscal  we recorded an impairment write down of  in advance royalties paid for the international distribution rights to a line of programming to the estimated fair value based on lower revised estimated ultimate revenues 
fiscal gross profit margins were negatively affected by adjustments resulting from the change in method of international video distribution 
we adjusted gross profit lower by approximately  associated with the additional sales returns reserves recorded for estimated subdistributor returns as well recorded inventory write downs of  see change in international video distribution 
also  contributing to lower fiscal gross profit margins were nonaccountable advertising and promotional allowances offered to our international subdistributors during fiscal we record these allowances as a reduction of net revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
during fiscal  advertising and promotional expenses were only deducted from purchases after review and approval by the company and  accordingly  were classified as selling expenses rather than a reduction of revenues 
although royalties payable to our exclusive program suppliers will be higher on bmg generated sublicense income  as compared to revenues generated from our direct european subdistribution of our exclusive programming  we will no longer be obligated to accrue and pay international music publishing fees on exclusive releases as a cost of sales 
the obligation to discharge music publishing to the international music publishing rights societies is now bmg s as part of their sublicense agreement with the company 
additionally  as a result of the bmg s responsibilities under the sublicense agreement  we will no longer manufacture and package the majority of our exclusive programming for european release and charge cost of sales upon sale of the programming

the regional sales managers were added to seek new customer accounts and more efficiently handle certain territories 
the exclusive brand managers were added to focus specifically on marketing specific brands we exclusively acquire and distribute 
the increase in selling expenses for fiscal was partially offset by a reduction in annual advertising expense lower by 
our advertising expenditures on a specific title and line of programming basis will depend on the titles in release and the programs created by the marketing department

liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary primarily with the level of our program acquisition  production and distribution activities 
recurring principal uses of working capital in the company s operations are for acquiring exclusive programming ie  royalty payments  including advance payment against future royalties to program suppliers  advance payments under exclusive distribution agreements  manufacturing and production costs  costs of acquiring finished programming for exclusive and nonexclusive distribution  selling  general and administrative expenses and debt service 
availability of working capital is a substantial factor in image s ability to acquire new programming 
therefore  maximizing available working capital is critical to our business operations 
our financial resources are limited and in the future we may need to raise additional funding to continue expanding operations and acquiring desirable programming 
should additional funds be raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of image s existing stockholders may be reduced 
should additional funds be raised through the issuance of debt  our interest expense would increase 
if adequate funds are not available or are unavailable on acceptable terms  the company may find it is unable to fund expansion of operations  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance programming or services  or respond to competitive pressures in the industry 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at march  and the effects of such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations licensing and exclusive distribution agreements total sources and uses of working capital for fiscal our cash balance increased to  at march   from  at march  the primary reasons for the increase are as follows net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  in march  we received a million royalty advance from bmg see royalty advance from bmg below 
accrued music publishing fees increased to million at march   from million at march  through our representatives  we are working with the respective domestic music publishers and international publishing rights societies to solidify rates on music programming released in the dvd and vhs formats 
the company has recorded the accruals based upon its best estimates of the liabilities utilizing supporting contractual rates  current industry trends and historical activity 
the company expects to ultimately finalize rates on the majority of its releases and schedule the pay down of accrual to date in the coming fiscal year 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was  we received approximately million from the sale of property in las vegas  nevada see sale and leaseback of las vegas  nevada property below

the company s liquidity position at march  at march   we had cash of  and borrowing availability of  and  respectively  under our revolving credit and term loan facilities with wells fargo foothill foothill 
our revolving credit obligation to foothill was  and we had one outstanding standby letter of credit for  issued by foothill to secure trade payables to a program supplier 
our future fiscal obligations for royalty advances  distribution fees  minimum guarantees and other fees totaled  due during fiscal   due in fiscal   due in fiscal   due in fiscal and  due in fiscal these advances and guarantees are recoupable against future royalties and distribution fees earned by our exclusive program suppliers in connection with revenues generated by those rights 
image faces competition in securing exclusive rights from independent distribution companies as well as major motion picture studios and music labels 
historically  we have paid significant up front advances against future royalties and distribution fees to secure exclusive dvd and other home entertainment format distribution rights 
continued availability of sufficient working capital is a substantial factor in our ability to license and produce new exclusive programming and acquire programming for exclusive distribution 
therefore  maximizing available working capital is critical to our business operations 
without sufficient working capital  we may not be able to remain competitive with advance offers from competitors who might be willing to pay larger advances or who have greater financial resources 
during the prior three fiscal quarters  we implemented steps to provide additional working capital and reduce debt including increasing the maximum borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility with foothill by million from million to million  receiving million from the sale and leaseback of our las vegas  nevada distribution facility and adjacent vacant land  raising million through a private placement sale of image s common stock  receiving a million initial advance from bmg and converting million of the remaining million due image investors co 
iic under the convertible subordinated note payable to common stock and repaying the remaining million due under the note 
we will continue to focus on effectively managing our capital resources and seeking appropriate financing when necessary in order to acquire rights to the programming we desire in order to fully execute on our business plans
