general we are an integrator and reseller of computer hardware  software and networking products  primarily for commercial customers  and a distributor of display technology solutions and plasma display monitors  primarily to dealers and system integrators 
we offer our customers single source solutions  customized to their information systems needs  by integrating analysis  design and implementation services with hardware  software  networking products and peripherals from leading vendors 
to date  most of our revenues have been derived from product sales 
we generally do not develop or sell software products 
however  certain computer hardware products sold by us are loaded with prepackaged software products 
certain trends and uncertainties general 
the technology industry is characterized by a number of potentially adverse business conditions  including pricing pressures  evolving distribution channels  market consolidation and a decline in the rate of growth in sales of personal computers 
heightened price competition among various manufacturers may result in reduced per unit revenue and declining gross profit margins 
as a result of the intense price competition within our industry  we have experienced increasing pressure on our gross profit and operating margins with respect to our sale of products 
our inability to compete successfully on the pricing of products sold  or a continuing decline in gross margins on products sold due to adverse industry conditions or competition  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
value added services 
an integral part of our strategy is to increase our value added services revenue 
these services generally provide higher gross margins than those associated with the sale of products 
this strategy requires us  among other things  to attract and retain highly skilled technical employees in a competitive labor market  provide additional training to our sales representatives and enhance our existing service management system 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in increasing our focus on providing value added services  and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
geographic considerations 
on september   the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in washington  dc were the subjects of terrorist attacks 
a significant part of our business is generated from our new york city and baltimore washington  dc offices 
we cannot predict the impact that potential future attacks may have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  given the concentration of our business in these geographic areas  our business could be materially affected by economic conditions and other significant events in the new york city and baltimore washington  dc areas 
management of growth 
our strategy  encompassing the expansion of service offerings  the expansion of existing offices  and the establishment of new regional offices  has challenged and will continue to challenge our senior management and infrastructure 
we cannot predict our ability to respond to these challenges 
if we fail to effectively manage our planned growth  there may be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
personnel issues 
the success of our strategy depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel and sales representatives  including independent sales representatives  in a very competitive labor market 
the loss of a significant number of our existing technical personnel or sales representatives  difficulty in hiring or retaining additional technical personnel or sales representatives  or reclassification of our sales representatives as employees may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition 
the technology industry is characterized by intense competition 
we directly compete with local  regional and national systems integrators  value added resellers and distributors as well as with certain technology manufacturers that market through direct sales forces and or the internet 
the technology industry has recently experienced  and may continue to experience  a significant amount of consolidation through mergers and acquisitions  and manufacturers of personal computers may increase competition by offering a range of services in addition to their current product and service offerings 
in the future  we may face further competition from new market entrants and possible alliances between existing competitors 
in addition  certain suppliers and manufacturers have been  and additional suppliers and manufacturers may choose  to market products directly to end users through a direct sales force and or the internet rather than or in addition to channel distribution  and may also choose to market services directly to end users 
some of our competitors have or may have  greater financial  marketing and other resources  and may offer a broader range of products and services  than us 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements  benefit from greater purchasing economies  offer more aggressive hardware and service pricing or devote greater resources to the promotion of their products and services 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with these or other current or potential competitors 
vendor relationships and product availability 
our business is dependent upon our relationships with major manufacturers and distributors in the technology industry 
many aspects of our business are affected by our relationships with major manufacturers  including product availability  pricing and related terms  and reseller authorizations 
the increasing demand for display technology solutions and ancillary equipment has resulted in significant product shortages from time to time  because manufacturers have been unable to produce sufficient quantities of certain products to meet demand 
in addition  many manufacturers have adopted just in time manufacturing principles that can reduce the immediate availability of a wide range of products at any one time 
we cannot predict that manufacturers will maintain an adequate supply of these products to satisfy all the orders of our customers or that  during periods of increased demand  manufacturers will provide products to us  even if available  or at discounts previously offered to us 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the pricing and related terms offered by major manufacturers will not adversely change in the future 
our failure to obtain an adequate supply of products  the loss of a major manufacturer  the deterioration of our relationship with a major manufacturer or our inability in the future to develop new relationships with other manufacturers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on may   the hewlett packard company and compaq computer corporation merged 
manchester sold the products of both companies and we believe that we had strong relationships with both companies and continue to have a strong relationship with the merged company 
while we do not believe that there will be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as a result of this merger  there can be no assurance that such a material adverse effect will not occur 
certain manufacturers offer market development funds  cooperative advertising and other promotional programs to systems integrators  distributors and computer resellers 
we rely on these funds for many of our advertising and promotional campaigns 
in recent years  manufacturers have generally reduced their level of support with respect to these programs  which has required us to increase spending of our own funds to obtain the same level of advertising and promotion 
if manufacturers continue to reduce their level of support for these programs  or discontinue them altogether  we would have to further increase our advertising and promotion spending  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability has been affected by our ability to obtain volume discounts from certain manufacturers  which has been dependent  in part  upon our ability to sell large quantities of products to computer resellers  including value added resellers 
our sales to resellers have been made at profit margins generally less favorable than our sales directly to commercial customers 
our inability to sell products to computer resellers and thereby obtain the desired volume discounts from manufacturers or to expand our sales to commercial customers sufficiently to offset our need to rely on sales to computer resellers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changing technology  inventory risk 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent introduction of new hardware and software products and services 
this may render many existing products and services noncompetitive  less profitable or obsolete 
our continued success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the technological developments of new products and services and to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
our success will also depend upon our abilities to address the technical requirements of our customers arising from new generations of computer technologies  to obtain these new products from present or future suppliers and vendors at reasonable costs  to educate and train our employees as well as our customers with respect to these new products or services and to integrate effectively and efficiently these new products into both our internal systems and systems developed for our customers 
we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing product and service developments or enhancements in response to these technological changes 
our failure to respond effectively to these technological changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid product improvement and technological change characterize the technology industry 
this results in relatively short product life cycles and rapid product obsolescence  which can place inventory at considerable valuation risk 
certain of our suppliers provide price protection to us  which is intended to reduce the risk of inventory devaluation due to price reductions on current products 
certain of our suppliers also provide stock balancing to us pursuant to which we are able to return unsold inventory to a supplier as a partial credit against payment for new products 
there are often restrictions on the dollar amount of inventory that we can return at any one time 
price protection and stock balancing may not be available to us in the future  and  even if available  these measures may not provide complete protection against the risk of excess or obsolete inventories 
certain manufacturers have reduced the period for which they provide price protection and stock balancing rights 
although we maintain a sophisticated proprietary inventory management system  we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully manage our existing and future inventory 
our failure to successfully manage our current or future inventory may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the rapid changes that are taking place in computer  networking and display technologies  product life cycles are short 
accordingly  our product offerings change constantly 
prices of products change frequently  with generally higher prices early in the life cycle of the product and lower prices near the end of the product s life cycle 
the technology industry has experienced rapid declines in average selling prices of personal computers  peripherals and display technology 
in some instances  we have been able to offset these price declines with increases in units shipped 
there can be no assurance that average selling prices will not continue to decline or that we will be able to offset declines in average selling prices with increases in units shipped 
management 
the company is highly dependent upon the services of the members of its senior management team  particularly barry r 
steinberg  the company s founder  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of any member of the company s senior management team may have a material adverse effect on its business 
acquisitions 
the company envisions that part of our future growth will come from acquisitions consistent with our strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and  once identified  to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us  or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with our operations 
certain of these acquisitions may be of significant size and may include assets that are outside our geographic territories or are ancillary to our core business strategy 
quarterly variations 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
quarterly revenue and operating results generally fluctuate as a result of the demand for our products and services  the introduction of new hardware and software technologies with improved features  the introduction of new services by us and our competitors  changes in the level of our operating expenses  competitive conditions and economic conditions 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
microsoft litigation 
most of the personal computers we sell utilize operating systems developed by microsoft corporation 
the united states department of justice has brought a successful antitrust action against microsoft 
on november   the united states district court for the district of columbia issued an order entering a final judgment in the action 
we believe that the final judgment  if implemented  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
however  the final judgment has been appealed  and we cannot predict the outcome of the appeal or the effect that any modifications to the final judgment would have on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
information technology systems 
our success is dependent in part on the accuracy  proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems  including our business application systems  internet servers and telephony system 
the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems affects  among other things  our ability to conduct business with our customers  manage our inventory and accounts receivable  purchase  sell  ship and invoice our products efficiently and on a timely basis and maintain cost efficient operations 
while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats  including computer viruses and malicious hackers  we cannot guarantee that such steps will be effective 
if there is a disruption to or an infiltration of our information technology systems  it could significantly harm our business and results of operations 
stock repurchase program 
the company s board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock  which authorization is effective until the first board of directors meeting following the close of our fiscal year expected to be at the end of october  unless earlier terminated by the board 
the extent to which the company repurchases its stock and the timing of such purchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations to be evaluated by the executive committee of the board 
the repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific number of shares  and repurchases pursuant to the program may be suspended or resumed at any time or from time to time without further notice or announcement 
there can be no assurance as to the effect  if any  that the adoption of the repurchase program or the making of repurchases thereunder will have on the market price of our common stock 
this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive  but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the company s outlook and results 
e commerce we utilize two websites each incorporating an electronic commerce system 
the sites  located at www 
e manchester 
com and www 
electrograph 
com allow both existing customers  corporate shoppers and others to find product specifications  compare products  check price and availability and place and track orders quickly and easily hours a day seven days a week 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  significant investments and improvements in our e commerce capabilities 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enhancing and increasing our business through our expanded internet presence

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the securities and exchange commission  encourages all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment to the customer 
revenue from services is recognized when the related services are performed 
when product sales and services are bundled  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of the product and completion of the installation 
service contract fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the period of the applicable contract 
deferred service contract revenue represents the unearned portion of service contract fees 
the company generally does not develop or sell software products 
however  certain computer hardware products sold by the company are loaded with prepackaged software products 
the net impact on the company s financial statements of product returns  primarily for defective products  has been insignificant 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  the company must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to the company s results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information derived from the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of related revenue or total revenue

revenue increased by million or to million for the year ended july  or fiscal from million for the year ended july  or fiscal revenue from the sale of products increased by million or while revenue from service offerings increased by million or 
the increase in product revenue is primarily a result of increased sales of display technology solutions  primarily sales of large screen flat panel displays  by our electrograph subsidiary 
the increase in service revenue is primarily attributable to the company s continued focus on growing its sales of services and solutions to its existing customer base and to new customers  as well as the growth in the sales of services that are delivered by manufacturers or vendors

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is principally due to lower salaries and personnel costs of approximately  reflecting the cost reduction measures that have been instituted by the company  decreased rent expense of approximately  as a result of the capital leases entered into by the company in march and decreased sales commissions of approximately  due to the lower gross margins earned on revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by higher telephone expenses of approximately  and increased bad debt expense of approximately  primarily due to the bankruptcy of one customer

income tax provision benefit 
our effective tax expense rate was in fiscal and our effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal the change in the rates is primarily due to the effect permanent differences have on the income or loss in the periods 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenue 
revenue decreased by million or to million for fiscal from million for the year ended july  or fiscal revenue from the sale of products decreased by million or while revenue from service offerings increased by million or 
the decrease in product revenue is primarily a result of lower sales of personal computers and peripherals as a result of the overall slowdown in economic activity in general as well as the decline in corporate spending in the technology industry in particular in fiscal this was partially offset by increased sales of display monitors  primarily large screen flat panel displays by our electrograph subsidiary

provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate increased from of pre tax income in fiscal to of pre tax income in fiscal this increase in fiscal is primarily the result of the company not having the benefit of the nontaxable life insurance proceeds received in fiscal as discussed in interest and other income above

at july   no amounts were outstanding under this line 
at july   the company was not in compliance with all the financial ratios and covenants that it is required to maintain in connection with its line of credit 
the company received a waiver waiving its requirements from its banks for the period ended july  we believe that our current balances in cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the line of credit will be adequate to support current operating levels for the foreseeable future  specifically through at least the end of fiscal we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures  other than operating and capital leases that the company has committed to for its facilities and certain tangible property 
future capital requirements of the company include those for the growth of working capital items such as accounts receivable and inventory  the purchase of equipment  expansion of facilities  as well as the possible opening of new offices  potential acquisitions and expansion of the company s service and e commerce capabilities 
in addition  there are no transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity or the availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
the company leased its warehouse and distribution center as well as its corporate offices and certain sales facilities from entities owned or controlled by shareholders  officers or directors of the company 
in march  the owners sold the properties leased by the company to an unaffiliated company 
in connection with the sale  the company entered into three fifteen year leases  each expiring on march   with the new owner 
lease terms include a lower base rent in the first year  annual rent increases of two percent and four five year renewal options 
the company recorded the new leases as capital leases and accordingly recorded an asset of approximately million 
the asset is classified in the balance sheet as property and equipment  net  and is amortized using the straight line method over the lease terms and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities 
the following represents the company s commitment under capital leases for each of the next five years ended july and thereafter in thousands and thereafter  total payments  amount representing interest  obligations under capital leases  obligations due within one year long term obligations under capital leases  the following represents the company s commitment under operating leases for each of the next five years ended july and thereafter in thousands thereafter the company regularly examines opportunities for strategic acquisitions of other companies or lines of business and anticipates that it may issue debt and or equity securities either as direct consideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be used in whole or in part in payment for acquired securities or assets 
the issuance of such securities could be expected to have a dilutive impact on the company s shareholders  and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any acquired business would contribute positive operating results commensurate with the associated investment

in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus opinion on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement should be allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with different provisions if the fair value of all deliverables is not known or if the fair value is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting
