item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
as a result of this transition  we expect flat to relatively modest revenue growth in 
table of contents we expect to leverage this modest revenue growth through continued efforts to control our operating costs 
total operating costs  including direct costs  selling and marketing costs  product development costs and general and administrative costs  declined slightly to million in from in  despite the inclusion of operating costs of approximately million from the sdi  regency and point acquisitions 
we believe that the combination of new enterprise revenue and our continuing focus on rationalizing costs will result in the generation of continued positive cash flow from operations and profits for continue to enhance our technological architecture to realize the full potential of our enterprise solutions due to rapid growth and numerous acquisitions  s products encompassed several overlapping technologies and applications 
in order to realize the full potential of our solution  and make the most effective use of our development resources  it was imperative to re write the technological architecture underlying many of our products 
our initial focus was on converging our internet based products to a single platform as delivered in early from that point  we began to focus on integrating products serving other channels into the single platform so we can leverage their functionality and deliver true multi channel integration 
a key component of the s enterprise family of products is the s enterprise platform  which not only provides integration across all of a financial institution s channels  but enables the financial institution to leverage the interfaces built to their back end systems  share customer data across the organization  and deliver comprehensive  integrated marketing programs 
s enterprise platform technology features an open  flexible and operable architecture that incorporates existing legacy and third party applications  while also helping the financial institution move toward a standard platform that unifies its channel strategy 
this platform provides the most robust transactional and crm capabilities for both end user customers and internal users alike 
an n tier  component based architecture  the s enterprise platform utilizes common industry standards such as jee and xml for integrating third party solutions  existing systems and evolving technology standards 
in addition  the s enterprise platform facilitates a common customer experience by supporting multiple delivery channels  such as web  call centers  wireless  branch and advisors 
the s enterprise platform serves as a common base for s product deployments 
its layered framework ensures that all applications are consistent in their interpretation and presentation of all data and that they can be extended  upgraded  maintained and operated 
increase revenues by cross selling our products and services to existing customers we intend to generate revenues by selling additional s products and services to our existing customer base of over  financial institutions 
we believe that opportunities for cross selling our products and services will increase as we deliver more of our applications on the s enterprise platform  and as we continue to add and enhance products through acquisition and internal development 
in addition to the sale of new products  the migration of our customer base from single channel solutions to the integrated enterprise applications will offer further revenue growth opportunities 
increase emphasis on selling packaged products we are increasing our emphasis on selling packaged solutions instead of highly customized  tool kit oriented solutions 
the market is moving from early adopters to the mainstream majority 
our customers are increasingly focused on implementing packages that can be extended and customized as opposed to buying tool kits that require a high degree of customization and result in more expensive ongoing maintenance and issues with other vendors software upgrades 
grow our sales channel program through strategic alliances with key partners in  we continued to expand our relationship with international business machines corporation 
we ported some internet based products to the ibm p series platform aix and have been working jointly with ibm to implement this solution for one of our customers

formerly kpmg consulting  inc and anticipate strengthening those relationships in in  we began working with viecore  inc we also signed with numerous resellers globally to increase our sales presence in areas where we do not have extensive direct sales coverage including south america  the middle east region  italy and the asia pacific region

in the americas region our sales force is a mix of named account support  geographic support and inside sales support depending on the size of the financial institution 
the named accounts sales force focuses on developing long term relationships with senior management of financial institutions

competition the market for financial software is competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to technological change 
we currently perceive our primary competition as coming from three areas in house development organizations of financial institutions  best of breed solution providers and core processing vendors 
we believe that these strategies are inefficient for financial organizations  particularly during a time when many financial institutions are seeking to integrate their offerings across their multiple delivery channels 
in house development organizations we believe financial organizations may encounter the following challenges when building financial software in house building  maintaining and upgrading an in house solution can be very costly  attracting and retaining the necessary technical personnel can be difficult and costly  and technological development may be too far outside the financial organization s core competencies to be effective or successful 

table of contents best of breed solution providers these vendors offer solutions for a specific line of business and or channel for the financial institution 
in the retail internet banking space  we compete with digital insight corporation  financial fusion a division of sybase  inc and corillian corporation 
in branch banking  we compete with argo data resource  inc and webtone technologies  inc 
in business banking  we compete with fundtech ltd  politzer haney and metavante corporation 
in crm we compete with siebel systems  inc  peoplesoft  inc 
and onyx software corporation 
we believe the disadvantages associated with a best of breed solution approach include integrating additional applications and channels with multiple vendors greatly lengthens a financial organization s time to market  operating and upgrading solutions from multiple vendors is very costly  and a combination of best of breed solutions across different channels does not provide an integrated view of the customer 
core processing vendors these vendors offer data processing services and outsourcing for financial institutions systems of record 
in this space we compete with companies such as metavante  fiserv  inc and jack henry and associates  inc many of these companies offer front office products at a sharp discount to augment their back office capabilities 
we believe the primary disadvantage of this approach is that these front office applications will lag behind the market to some degree in terms of functions and features and are of secondary focus to the vendor behind their back office products and services 
business held for sale through our edify corporation subsidiary  we provide a variety of crm applications that allow organizations in various industries to automate  integrate  personalize and analyze interactions with customers across touch points such as phone  web  wireless  email  fax and kiosk 
in july  we announced our plan to sell this business together with the non financial institutions business of point information systems  a leading european crm application provider that we acquired in march the addition of point s product suite provides edify with a full crm suite  including marketing  sales and service automation  and will enhance edify s up sell and cross sell functionality within its multi channel customer service solutions 
as of march   edify employed people worldwide 
edify s business is based in santa clara  california with offices located in dallas  texas  london  united kingdom  edinburgh  united kingdom and dublin  ireland 
following the planned divestiture of this combined business  which we expect to occur before july   all of our remaining businesses will be focused on the financial institutions market 
government regulation we are subject to examination  and are indirectly regulated by  the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the office of thrift supervision and the various state financial regulatory agencies that supervise and regulate the banks and thrift institutions for which we provide data processing services 
matters subject to review and examination by federal and state financial institution regulatory agencies include our internal controls in connection with our performance of data processing services and the agreements giving rise to those processing activities 
laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
currently  there are internet laws regarding copyrights  taxation and the transmission of specified types of material 
congress also adopted legislation imposing obligations on financial institutions to notify their customers of the institution s privacy practices  restrict the sharing of non public customer data with non affiliated parties at the customer s request  and establish procedures and practices to protect and secure customer data 
these privacy provisions are implemented by regulations with which compliance is now required 
additionally  there are many legislative and regulatory actions pending at the state and federal level with respect to privacy 
further  our customers and we may be faced with state and federal requirements that differ drastically  and in some cases conflict 
in addition  the european union enacted its own privacy regulations and is currently considering other internet related legislation 
the law of the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and 
table of contents development of the market for online financial services  including online banking  may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
we are also subject to encryption and security export laws which  depending on future developments  could adversely affect our business 
employees as of march   we had approximately  employees in our continuing operations  including in customer support  hosting services and professional services  in sales and marketing and in product development 
in addition to full time employees  we have used the services of various independent contractors for professional services projects and product development 
we have contractors in our pune facility working on product development activities

risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks before you decide to buy our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or a part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and any fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common stock our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly to date 
if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors as a result of any future fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
we may experience fluctuations in future quarters because we cannot accurately predict the number and timing of contracts we will sign in a period  in part because the budget constraints and internal review processes of existing and potential customers are not within our control  the length of our sales cycle to large financial organizations generally lasts from to months  which adds an element of uncertainty to our ability to forecast revenues  if we fail to introduce new or enhanced products  or if our competitors introduce new or enhanced products  sales of our products and services may not achieve expected levels and or may decline  our ability to expand the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold may be limited  our products may not achieve widespread consumer acceptance  which could cause our revenues to be lower than expected  we have significant contracts with legacy customers that are winding down and we may not be able to replace this revenue and or the gross margins associated with this revenue  our sales may be constrained by the timing of releases of third party software that works with our products  and a significant percentage of our expenses is relatively fixed  and we may be unable to reduce expenses in the short term if revenues decrease 
acquisitions and divestitures may be costly and difficult to integrate divest  divert management resources or dilute stockholder value we acquired three companies in  one company in and two companies in the first quarter of the integration of these companies and any future acquisitions into our existing operations is a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business 
we have encountered substantial difficulties  costs and delays in integrating the acquired operations with our own and may continue to do so in the future 
among the issues related to integration are potential incompatibility of business cultures  potential delays in rationalizing diverse technology platforms  potential difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations  potential difficulties in re training sales forces to market all of our products across all of our intended markets  potential difficulties implementing common internal business systems and processes  potential conflicts in third party relationships  and the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns 

table of contents we sold one company in january we are currently holding a business unit for sale 
we anticipate the completion of this sale by june  we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue and if any of those customers terminates its contract our revenues and financial performance would decline we derive significant revenues from two customers 
we had one customer that accounted for  and of our total revenue from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
we expect revenues from this customer to decline to approximately of our revenues from continuing operations in in  we had one customer that accounted for of our total revenues from continuing operations 
revenues from this customer are derived from a subscription license  professional services and a hosting agreement all of which end in there is no assurance that we will be able to replace the declining revenues from these two customers 
a substantial number of our customer contracts require payment of liquidated damages upon early termination 
these damages are usually insufficient to replace the ongoing revenue we would have otherwise earned 
we have experienced substantial losses and may not maintain profitable operations in the future although we incurred losses in fiscal years  and  we were profitable in the fourth quarter of in the past  we approved restructuring plans related to the streamlining of our worldwide operations 
we continue to review our cost structure on a worldwide basis and look for additional ways to streamline our operations 
we believe our efforts to streamline operations  including headcount reductions and consolidation of our operating facilities  have resulted in costs savings that have improved our margins and our cash flows from operating activities during and we cannot ensure that our efforts to streamline our operations will improve our financial performance  or that we will be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we generally are unable to reduce our expenses significantly in the short term to compensate for any unexpected delay or decrease in anticipated revenues 
as a result  we may experience losses  which could negatively impact the value of our common stock 
market volatility may affect the price of our common stock the trading prices of technology stocks in general  and ours in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
our stock price has declined significantly since reaching a high in any further negative change in the public s perception of the prospects of technology based companies  particularly those which are associated with the internet or e commerce such as ours  could further depress our stock price regardless of our results of operations 
other broad market and industry factors may decrease the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  also may decrease the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of new products  product enhancements  technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the computer software  electronic commerce and internet industries  changes in the market valuations of other technology companies  developments in internet regulations  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  unscheduled system downtime of our products in either a hosted or in house environment  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could negatively affect our stock price if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued when options and warrants are exercised or shares of our preferred stock are converted into common stock  the market price of our common stock could fall 
as of march   we had million shares of common stock outstanding  assuming no exercise of outstanding 
table of contents options or warrants or conversion of preferred stock 
as of march   there were outstanding employee stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock  options and warrants to acquire million shares of our common stock  and million shares of preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
the common stock issuable after vesting and upon exercise of these options and warrants and upon conversion of this preferred stock will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time 
the possible sale of a significant number of these shares may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
some of the holders of restricted shares of our common stock  our preferred stock and vested options or warrants have rights that may require us to register shares of common stock with the securities and exchange commission 
by exercising their registration rights and causing a large number of shares to be sold in the public market  these stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
a significant portion of our customers are in the rapidly consolidating financial services industry  which is subject to economic changes that could reduce demand for our products and services for the foreseeable future  we expect to derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the banking industry and other financial services firms such as insurance and securities brokerage companies 
changes in economic conditions and unforeseen events  like recession or inflation  could occur and reduce consumers use of banking services 
any event of this kind  or implementation for any reason by banks of cost reduction measures  could result in significant decreases in demand for our products and services 
mergers and acquisitions are pervasive in today s banking industry 
our existing customers may be acquired by or merged into other financial institutions that have their own financial software solution or decide to terminate their relationships with us for other reasons 
as a result  our sales could decline if an existing customer is merged into or acquired by another company 
network or internet security problems could damage our reputation and business despite our security measures  the core of our network infrastructure could be vulnerable to unforeseen technology problems 
although we have taken steps to mitigate much of the risk  we may in the future experience interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of internet users  current and former employees or others 
unknown security risks may result in liability to us and also may deter financial organizations from licensing our software and services 
although we intend to continue to implement and establish security measures  there can be no assurance that measures we have implemented will not be circumvented in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the occurrence of any of these problems could reduce product demand from potential customers and cause existing customers to terminate their license or data center contracts with us 
these problems could also require us to spend significant capital to remedy any failure and could subject us to costly litigation with customers or their end users 
our market is highly competitive and  if we are unable to keep pace with evolving technology  our revenue and future prospects may decline the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  intense competition and evolving industry standards 
we have many competitors who offer various components of our suite of applications or who use a different technology platform to accomplish similar tasks 
in some cases  our existing customers also use some of our competitors products 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop  sell and support enhancements of current products and new software products in response to changing customer needs 
if the completion of the next version of any of our products is delayed  our revenue and future prospects could be harmed 
in addition  competitors may develop products or technologies that the industry considers more attractive than those we offer or that render our technology obsolete 
we are engaged in offshore software development activities  which may not be successful and which may put our intellectual property at risk in order to optimize available research and development resources and meet development timeframes  we established a relationship with an indian based development organization in to outsource portions of our product development 
we expanded this relationship in to a newly created development center in india 
while our experience to date with these activities has been positive  there is no assurance that this will continue 
specifically  there are a number of risks associated with this activity  including but not limited to the following communications and information flow may be less efficient and accurate as a consequence of the time  distance and language differences between our primary development organization and the indian based activities  resulting in delays in development or errors in the software developed  
table of contents potential disruption from the involvement of the united states in the conflicts in the middle east region  ramp up time for our indian based development efforts may adversely impact the ability to meet anticipated schedules  the quality of the development efforts undertaken off shore do not meet our requirements because of language  cultural and experiential differences  resulting in potential product errors and or delays  and there is the potential for misappropriation of our intellectual property that might not be readily discoverable 
we are involved in litigation over proprietary rights  which may be costly and time consuming we have received a claim that our products  trademarks or other proprietary rights require a license of intellectual property rights or infringe  or may infringe  on the intellectual property rights of others 
those claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  or result in an injunction being issued against the use of our products 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks  whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor 
in the event of an adverse ruling  we may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or obtain licenses to infringing technology 
our failure to develop or license a substitute technology could significantly harm our business 
we expect software to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties may have  or may eventually be issued  patents that would be infringed by our products or technology 
any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products or technology 
in addition  we may become involved in costly and time consuming litigation to protect the validity of our intellectual property rights 
infringement of our proprietary technology could hurt our competitive position and income potential our success depends upon our proprietary technology and information 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary technology and information 
because it is difficult to police unauthorized use of software  the steps we have taken to protect our services and products may not prevent misappropriation of our technology 
any misappropriation of our proprietary technology or information could reduce any competitive advantages we may have or result in costly litigation 
we now also have a significant international presence 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary technology as well as the laws of the united states 
our ability to protect our proprietary technology abroad may not be adequate 
international operations and currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us we conduct our business worldwide and may be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  governmental currency controls  changes in various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  difficulties in enforcing our contracts in foreign jurisdictions  export import controls  tariff regulations  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and support operations  
table of contents greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection  and possible adverse tax consequences 
in addition  we maintain our international executive offices and a significant portion of our maintenance  consulting  and research and development operations in europe 
therefore  our operations may also be affected by economic conditions in europe 
these risks associated with international operations may harm our business 
if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled technical employees  we may not be able to compete based on the significant growth in our operations and the need for highly skilled technical employees  we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel 
because the development of our software requires knowledge of computer hardware  as well as a variety of software applications  we need to attract and retain technical personnel who are proficient in all these disciplines 
there is substantial competition for employees with the technical skills we require 
if we cannot hire and retain talented technical personnel  this could adversely affect our growth prospects and future success 
we are subject to government regulation we are subject to examination  and are indirectly regulated  by the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the office of thrift supervision and the various state financial regulatory agencies that supervise and regulate the banks and thrift institutions for which we provide data processing services 
matters subject to review and examination by federal and state financial institution regulatory agencies include our internal controls in connection with our performance of data processing services and the agreements giving rise to those processing activities 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet  or interpretations of existing law  could adversely affect our business laws and regulations which apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
currently  there are internet laws regarding copyrights  taxation and the transmission of specified types of material 
congress also adopted legislation imposing obligations on financial institutions to notify their customers of the institution s privacy practices  restrict the sharing of non public customer data with non affiliated parties at the customer s request  and establish procedures and practices to protect and secure customer data 
these privacy provisions are implemented by regulations with which compliance is now required 
additionally  there are many legislative and regulatory actions pending at the state and federal level with respect to privacy 
further  our customers and we may be faced with state and federal requirements that differ drastically  and in some cases conflict 
in addition  the european union enacted its own privacy regulations and is currently considering other internet related legislation 
the law of the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online financial services  including online banking  may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
restrictions on our export of encrypted technology could cause us to incur delays in international sales our solutions use encrypted technology  the export of which is regulated by the united states government 
if the united states government were to adopt new legislation restricting the export of software or encryption technology  we could experience delays or reductions in our shipments of products internationally 
in addition  existing or future export regulations could limit our ability to distribute our solutions outside of the united states 
system failures or performance problems with our products could cause demand for these products to decrease  require us to make significant capital expenditures or impair customer relations there are many factors that could adversely affect the performance  quality and desirability of our products and could delay or prevent these products from gaining market acceptance 
these factors include  but are not limited to the following extraordinary end user volumes or other events could cause systems to fail  
table of contents our products could contain errors  or bugs  which could impair the services we provide  during the initial implementation of some products  we have experienced significant delays in implementing and integrating software  and we may experience similar difficulties or delays in connection with future implementations and upgrades to new versions  and many of our products require integration with third party products and systems  and we may not be able to integrate these products with new or existing products

item legal proceedings 
s and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the normal course of business 
included among these are the following s corporation and its subsidiary davidge data systems are involved in litigation with scottrade  inc and an affiliate company  computer research  inc  relating to a software development project

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licensing our solutions and providing professional services 
we generate recurring data center revenues by charging our data center customers a monthly fixed fee or a fee based on the number of their end users who use the solutions we provide  subject to a minimum charge 
we also generate recurring revenues by charging our customers a periodic fee for maintenance 
we generate revenues from two principal product groups s enterprise or multi channel financial solutions and legacy or single channel financial solutions 
we define s enterprise revenue as those fees that we earn from sales of our recently released s enterprise applications  such as s personal banking or s business banking  as well as fees that we earn from customers who have signed an s enterprise agreement 
revenues from non s enterprise single channel financial solutions represent fees that we earn from customers who only use our legacy channel solutions 
our strategy is to transition from a business model of providing single channel applications to providing integrated multi channel enterprise solutions 
we intend to upgrade a significant number of our customers to the s enterprise platform and cross sell and or up sell additional channel applications to our installed base as they migrate to an s enterprise solution 
we believe customers will migrate to an s enterprise solution because it is an integrated suite of products that lowers the cost of ownership versus separate point solutions and provides one view of the customer  which leads to higher customer satisfaction 
customers who purchase an s enterprise solution provide us with the economic benefit of higher average selling prices and it builds longer term customer relationships 
during the year ended december   we recorded revenue of million from our s enterprise solutions 
in future periods  we expect revenues from our s enterprise solutions to increase as a percentage of our total revenues 
our s enterprise solutions target large and mid market and regional financial institutions 
we earned a significant portion of our revenues in and from a few large financial institution customers 
in connection with our acquisitions of sdi  regency and point  we have significantly increased the number of our financial institution customers to over  most of these financial institution customers are mid sized and regional financial institutions 
as a result  we expect that a greater percentage of our future revenues will be earned from mid sized and regional financial institutions 
while we expect to generate a considerably higher number of contracts each year from mid sized and regional financial institutions  the average contract value and  therefore  margin contribution from each contract is significantly lower than the legacy contracts from large financial institution customers 
in  we had two major customers defined as those who individually contribute more than of total revenues 
revenues from state farm mutual automobile insurance company were  and of our revenues from continuing operations during the year ended december   and  respectively 
the revenue from this customer for the year ended december  decreased million from due to a decrease in professional services projects performed for that customer in we expect that professional services revenues from this major customer will continue to decrease in our other major customer  zurich insurance company and certain of its affiliates or subsidiaries  accounted for of our revenues from continuing operations during the year ended december  this customer contributed less than of our total revenues for the same period in effective april   we amended the terms of our arrangement with this customer 
under the terms of the revised agreement  we agreed to provide a subscription license until december  previously the contract expired in  data center services through december  and professional services 

table of contents in september  this customer announced its plan to discontinue operations running in our uk data center 
in march  we amended the terms of our arrangement the amendment such that zurich will pay million in two installments through july to accelerate the remaining services of the data center arrangement from december  to june  we will report those accelerated payments as data center revenue during the six months ending june   after which time we will have no further obligation to provide data center services to zurich 
the license and professional services components of the arrangement were not affected by the amendment 
in  we expect to record license and professional services revenue of million from zurich 
in march  we made the decision to consolidate our uk data center operations into our global hosting center in atlanta 
we expect to record restructuring charges during the six months ending june  for accelerated depreciation on the data center equipment  severance and benefits for terminated employees and various payments to terminate arrangements with vendors that provide services to support our uk data center operations 
our results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  were affected by the results of operations from acquired businesses  including software dynamics  inc september  regency systems  inc february and the assets and subsidiaries of point holdings  ltd 
march 
revenues and expenses from the operations of these acquired businesses were included in our operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
during the year ended december   we recorded total revenues of million in these acquired businesses 
we believe that the results achieved in the acquired businesses significantly exceeded those which they would have achieved on a stand alone basis 
we made these acquisitions because the acquired products and technologies are integral to our s enterprise suite of applications 
we have been able to cross sell existing s offerings into the acquired customer base and acquired product offerings into our existing customer base 
furthermore  we believe that we have been able to leverage our combined resources to increase the sales opportunities for these acquired products  especially those of sdi  whose revenues increased approximately during the nine months ended september  over the same period in  respectively 
you should also read our discussion of acquisitions below and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our results of operations were positively affected by the adoption of a new accounting principle  statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective january   we stopped amortizing goodwill and assembled workforce  which was reclassified to goodwill 
retroactive application of this new accounting treatment is prohibited by sfas pro forma results for and are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements giving effect to the accounting change as if it were applicable to those prior periods 
throughout  we continued to invest in the development of our new integrated s enterprise platform as the technology foundation for the s enterprise family of products 
the s enterprise platform provides financial institutions and their customers with a single integrated view of a customer s relationships  which increases customer satisfaction  enables financial services providers to leverage the interfaces built to their back end systems  share customer data across their enterprise and deliver comprehensive  integrated marketing programs  provides an open  flexible  and scalable architecture that leverages existing legacy and third party applications  allows financial services providers to move toward a standard platform to unify their channel strategy and provide transactional and crm capabilities to both their external and internal customers  and lowers the costs of ownership for financial institutions versus single channel applications 
in the first quarter of  we released for general availability the first two applications to be deployed on the s enterprise platform s personal banking and s business banking 
during the third quarter of  we announced the successful implementation for our first s enterprise customer and their transition into live production 
as of the date of this report  twenty financial institutions are in production mode with a hosted or on premise s enterprise solution 
during july  we realigned our product development organization to be more efficient 
the realignment effort included creating eight centers of development excellence throughout the world six in the united states  one in europe and one in india 
we will continue to consolidate domain expertise in these locations taking into consideration the skills of the local development organization and the local workforce 
historically have not capitalized software development costs because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between technological feasibility and general customer release 
if technological feasibility is reached earlier in the development cycle  we may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 

table of contents we are continually reviewing our cost structure on a worldwide basis and looking for additional ways to streamline our operations and reduce our operating costs 
in  we realigned our resources domestically and internationally to match costs with expected revenues 
before additional personnel from acquisitions  we reduced our headcount by approximately people in all areas of our continuing business operations during we will continue to rationalize our operating cost structure and may execute similar cost reductions in the future 
in july  we announced our intent to pursue the sale of our contact center automation assets  composed of our edify corporation subsidiary and the non financial assets of our acquired point business 
beginning in the third quarter of  we accounted for these combined businesses as held for sale and presented their combined results under discontinued operations 
you should read note and note to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of the accounting treatment that has been applied to the contact center automation business in acquisitions in march  we acquired the assets and subsidiaries of point holdings  ltd  a dublin  ireland based crm application provider 
in february  we acquired regency systems  inc  a dallas  texas based provider of telephone and internet banking applications and web design services for community and mid market banks 
regency is part of our continuing operations 
point operations related to financial institution customers are included in continuing operations 
the point operations not associated with financial institution customers are now included in discontinued operations 
in september  we acquired software dynamics  inc  a west hills  california based provider of branch automation  teller  call center and crm solutions for financial institutions 
in april  we acquired davidge data systems  inc  a new york  new york based provider of order routing services to brokerage firms and q up systems  inc  an austin  texas based provider of internet financial services solutions to community banks 
in november  we acquired level next  inc  a provider of global trade banking systems 
these acquired businesses are all part of our continuing operations 
we accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets liabilities recorded as goodwill 
other intangible assets include developed technology and customer base 
additionally  for certain of these acquisitions  we allocated a portion of the purchase price to in process research and development  which was expensed immediately upon closing the acquisition 
the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for the acquired companies from the date of acquisition 
restructuring plans in november  we approved a restructuring plan to streamline our operations and to discontinue development on the edify retail banking platform 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees and closed several of our facilities worldwide 
during  we determined that  as a result of a softening in the domestic real estate markets  our original estimate of the costs to dispose of unused real estate was below the currently anticipated costs and the restructuring accrual was adjusted 
during the second quarter of  we approved a restructuring plan to streamline our european operations 
in connection with this plan  we reduced our european workforce by people and consolidated the majority of our european operations into two locations 
further adjustments to the restructuring accrual may be recorded in the future due to changes in estimates of lease termination reserves arising from changing real estate market conditions 
we continue to review our cost structure on a worldwide basis and look for additional ways to streamline our operations 
merger related costs during  we incurred merger related costs in connection with the acquisition of point 
these costs  incurred in connection with our plan to reorganize certain of our european operations  included headcount reduction  consolidation of s and acquired point office facilities and disposal of redundant or obsolete computer equipment 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
table of contents of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
generally  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under other assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition  estimation of our allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments  valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  discontinued operations  determination of technological feasibility and capitalization of software development costs  recognition of costs in connection with restructuring plans and merger related activities  and accounting for our equity method investment in yodlee 
revenue recognition 
revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is a key metric used by management  securities analysts and investors to evaluate our performance 
our revenue arrangements generally include multiple elements such as license fees for software products  installation services  customization services  training services  post contract customer support  data center services and  in some cases  hardware or other third party products 
software license revenue 
we recognize software license sales in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
for software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software provided there is evidence of an arrangement  collection of our fee is considered probable and the fee is fixed or determinable 
in certain of these arrangements  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to all elements of the arrangement 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element and exists for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method under sop no 
when the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we record revenue for the license and professional services over the implementation period using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract 
for software licenses where the license term does not begin until installation is complete  we recognize license and professional services revenue when we complete the installation of the software 
for subscription license arrangements where we allow customers the rights to unspecified products as well as unspecified upgrades and enhancements during a specified term  the license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
for license arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the license revenue is recognized as payments become due 
support and maintenance revenue 
revenues for post contract customer support and maintenance are recognized ratably over the contract period 
professional services revenue 
revenues derived from arrangements to provide professional services on a time and materials basis are recognized as the related services are performed 
revenues from professional services provided on a fixed fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for the contract 
data center revenue 
we recognize data center revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we also consider the applicability of emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to our data center arrangements on a contract by contract basis 
if it is determined that a software element covered by sop no 
is present in a hosting arrangement  the license  professional services and data center revenue is recognized pursuant to sop no 
if it is determined that a software element covered by sop no 
is not present in a 
table of contents hosting arrangement  we recognize revenue for the arrangement pursuant to sab no 
see a full discussion of our revenue recognition policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue on certain of our data center arrangements is allocated to the implementation and transaction processing elements using the residual method 
we have determined that our transaction processing services can be separated from the installation services as they represent separate earnings processes  evidence of fair value exists for the transaction processing services  and the transaction processing services are not essential to the functionality of any other element in the arrangement 
if it was determined that the implementation services cannot be separated from the transaction processing services in an arrangement  we would recognize the professional services revenue over the term of the data center arrangement or the expected period of performance  whichever is longer 
our contractual arrangements are evaluated on a contract by contract basis and often require our judgment and estimates that affect the classification and timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our products and services are fixed or determinable  whether or not collection of our fees is reasonably assured  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software product  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our products and services 
additionally  we may be required to make the following estimates the period that we expect to provide post contract support when the agreement does not contain a specific term  percentage of labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours for each contract  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  and the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts or billing adjustments 
if other judgments or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
for instance  many of our revenue arrangements are accounted for using the percentage completion of method since the services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
if it was determined that those services were not essential to the functionality of the software  we may have recognized the license revenue upon delivery of the license  provided other required criteria were satisfied 
further  if we determined that we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  we would defer all revenue and recognize it upon completion of the contract 
estimation of allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments 
we are required to report accounts receivable at the amount we expect to collect from our customers 
as a result  we are required to use our judgment to estimate the likelihood that certain receivables may not be collected or that we might offer future discounts or concessions for previously billed amounts 
as a result  we have established a discount allowance for estimated billing adjustments and a bad debt allowance for estimated amounts that we will not collect 
we report provisions for billing adjustments as a reduction of revenue and provisions for bad debts as a component of selling expense 
we review specific accounts for collectibility based on circumstances known to us at the date of our financial statements 
in addition  we maintain general reserves based on historical billing adjustments and write offs 
these estimates are based on historical discounts  concessions and bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
accordingly  our judgments and estimates about the collectibility of our accounts receivable affect revenue  selling expense and the carrying value of our accounts receivable 

table of contents valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets 
if such evaluation indicates a potential impairment  we use discounted cash flows to measure fair value in determining the amount of the long lived assets that should be written off 
for long term cost and equity investments  we write down their carrying values if it is determined that an impairment is other than temporary 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge on goodwill and other intangible assets that we deemed were impaired 
see further discussion of this charge in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we recorded impairment charges in the aggregate amount of million for cost basis investments that we deemed were impaired 
additionally  we recorded a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of on our investment in yodlee 
see further discussion of our equity investment in yodlee in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the aforementioned impairment charges required considerable analysis and judgment in determining the timing and amount of the charges 
if other assumptions and estimates were used in our evaluations  the timing and amount of the charges may have been significantly different 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which required us to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill at that date and will require us to perform impairment reviews thereafter  at least once annually 
the transitional impairment test required us to identify our reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
based on the results of our initial and annual tests  the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their carrying value 
while we no longer record amortization expense for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in any given period 
discontinued operations 
in july  we announced our plan to sell our contact center automation business  comprised of our edify subsidiary and the non financial institution business of point 
we are accounting for the planned divestiture as a business held for sale 
as a result we have presented the total assets of the contact center automation business on one line as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   presented the total liabilities of the contact center automation business on one line as liabilities of business held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   presented the results of operations for the contact center automation business as discontinued operations on one line in our consolidated statements of operations for all years presented  and ceased depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets associated with the contact center automation business from july  forward 
the classification of the contact center automation business assets and liabilities as held for sale will continue until such time that we sell the business  which we anticipate will happen no later than june  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets establishes criteria for determining when a business to be sold can be classified as held for sale 
the criteria  all of which must be met  are authorized management has committed to a plan to sell the business  the business is available for immediate sale in its present condition  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated  the sale of the business is probable and expected to be complete within one year  
table of contents the business is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
although there is no certainty that we will sell the customer contact center business prior to july  or at a price which we believe represents the business fair value  we believe we met these criteria as of december  and as of the filing date of this document 
if subsequently  we determined that we did not meet these criteria  we would be required to include the revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities of this business together with those that comprise our continuing operations 
in some cases  the separation of the assets and liabilities and results of operations from our continuing operations requires us to make estimates and or assumptions about the classification of accounts and transactions between continuing and discontinued operations 
accordingly  the results of operations of the continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of what they would have been if the contact center automation business had been sold prior to those periods  nor are the results of operations of the continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented in this report representative of what they will be in future periods on a stand alone basis 
we are also required to present the net assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value 
accordingly  if we believed that the net proceeds from the sale of the business would be less than the net book value of the business held for sale  we would be required to record a charge to reflect the business at a carrying value equal to its estimated fair value 
the completion of this analysis required us  among other things  to classify goodwill and other intangible assets recorded upon the acquisition of point between the financial institutions business of point which is in continuing operations and the non financial institutions business of point which is in discontinued operations 
to support our analysis  we obtained an independent appraisal of the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the financial institution and non financial institutions businesses of point 
determination of technological feasibility and capitalization of software development costs 
we are required to assess when technological feasibility occurs for products that we develop 
based on our judgment  we have determined that technological feasibility for our products generally occurs when we complete beta testing 
because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between completion of beta testing and general customer release  we have not capitalized any software development costs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if we determined that technological feasibility had occurred at an earlier point in the development cycle and that subsequent production costs incurred before general availability of the product were significant  we would have capitalized those costs and recognized them over future periods 
we continue to monitor changes in the software development cycle and may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
recognition of costs in connection with restructuring plans and merger related activities 
during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  we recorded charges in connection with restructurings 
additionally  we recorded merger related charges related to a reorganization of our european operations in connection with the acquisition of point in the second quarter of see further discussion of the terms of these charges in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at the date we approve a restructuring plan  we establish a liability for the estimated costs associated with that restructuring plan 
at that time  and thereafter until the plan activities are complete  the actual costs associated with the plan may differ from our estimates 
we use our judgment and information available to us at the date of the financial statements to reevaluate our initial estimates of the plan costs 
if we believe that our previous estimates are no longer accurate in light of current conditions  we adjust the reserve with a corresponding increase or decrease to current period earnings 
accrued restructuring costs at december  reflect our estimate of future rental obligations and other costs associated with office space that we do not plan to use in our operations as a result of the restructuring plans  offset by our estimate of sublease income for this space 
while we know the terms of our contractual lease obligations and related future commitments  we must estimate when and under what terms we will be able to sublet the space  if at all 
such estimates require a substantial amount of judgment  especially given current real estate market conditions 
actual sublease terms may differ substantially from our estimates 
any future changes in our estimates of lease termination reserves could materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses  we established reserves for certain contingencies that existed at the date of acquisition 
at that time  we believed that the resolution of the contingency would result in future cash expenditures that we estimated based on the information available at the date of acquisition 
as those contingencies are resolved  we reduce 
table of contents the related liabilities for any related cash disbursements or if we determine that the contingency is no longer likely to result in a loss 
if the settlement occurs beyond one year after the date of the acquisition  any difference in the actual settlement amount is reflected as an adjustment to income or expense in the period of resolution 
these adjustments are included in the merger related and restructuring costs line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
if the settlement occurs within one year of the date of acquisition  we record the difference as an adjustment to goodwill 
accounting for our equity method investment in yodlee 
on january   we sold our verticalone subsidiary to yodlee  inc in a stock for stock transaction in which we received an ownership interest of approximately in yodlee 
during  as a result of the issuance of additional equity by yodlee  our ownership percentage decreased to 
the chairman of our board of directors is also a director of yodlee 
additionally  in connection with the sale  we entered into the following agreements with yodlee a sales representation agreement  a data center agreement  and a facilities sublease 
we are a non exclusive reseller of yodlee s aggregation services under the sales representation agreement 
we evaluated the terms of our investment in and relationships with yodlee  and concluded that we exert significant influence over yodlee 
accordingly  we are accounting for our investment in yodlee under the equity method 
the equity method of accounting requires us to record our share of the net losses of yodlee in our consolidated statement of operations 
our equity in the net loss of yodlee for the year ended december  was million  including the amortization of our excess investment over our share of yodlee s net assets and an impairment charge to write down our investment in yodlee 
since our share of yodlee s underlying net assets was at december  and and we have not made any commitments to provide additional funding  we did not record our share of yodlee s operating results in  and we will not record our share of any future operating results until our basis in yodlee increases above  if ever 
if we determined that we did not exercise significant influence over yodlee  we would have accounted for this investment under the cost method 
under the cost method  we would have recorded the initial fair value of our investment in yodlee in our balance sheet 
however  we would not have recorded any share of yodlee s net losses during we would have evaluated the carrying value of the cost investment for recoverability and would write down the balance for any other than temporary impairments

revenues 
total revenues from continuing operations increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of

table of contents to provide a substantial amount of implementation  hosting and product enhancement services to state farm 
we derived and of our total revenues in and  respectively  from this customer 
additionally  in  we provided a subscription license  hosting and professional services to zurich 
we derived of our total revenues from this customer in software license revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from although most of our license revenue has to be replaced each period  license revenue earned from zurich comprised million of our license revenue in  an increase of million over this revenue comes from a subscription license arrangement that will terminate as of december  after that  we do not expect to earn future license revenues from zurich 
we recorded million of license revenues from our s enterprise products in single channel solutions  which comprise the remainder of our license revenues  decreased from license revenues generated from products of the acquired businesses  which are included in both s enterprise and single channel solutions  totaled million 
we expect s enterprise license revenues to grow as a percentage of our total revenues as we transition from a business model based on single channel solutions to an integrated multi channel enterprise solution 
support and maintenance revenues were million for  an increase of million or from this increase is primarily attributable to support and maintenance fees of million recorded in the acquired businesses 
professional services revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from million for this decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in professional services revenue from our major domestic customer and from other large projects  partially offset by professional service fees from the acquired businesses of approximately million 
in future periods  we expect revenues from professional services to become a smaller percentage of total revenues as large customization projects are completed and as we move towards a more packaged s enterprise solution and increased use of channel partners to perform services associated with our products 
data center revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the decrease in data center revenue was primarily due to the loss of several large data center customers  offset by an increase in the number of community and mid sized financial institutions utilizing s solutions in our data centers 
several large financial institution customers have moved their internet banking solutions in house either on our s enterprise platform or on a competitor s platform 
in addition  one large european bank shutdown its internet banking application during and zurich announced the shutdown of its application in as some of our customers transferred their s applications in house  we were able to replace a portion of these data center revenue streams with software license fees and support and maintenance fees 
we believe this transition will continue in as we expect a number of existing legacy customers  including zurich  to leave the data center during we expect data center revenues to increase to approximately million for the first half of as we recognize the accelerate payments from zurich  then stabilize at approximately million per quarter for the third and fourth quarters 
we believe the larger financial institutions will continue to move to in house solutions and mid sized and smaller financial institutions are moving towards our hosted environment 
it is unclear whether or not the revenues lost from large customers leaving the data center will be replaced by smaller customers coming into the data center 
none of the acquired businesses have a data center solution  accordingly  there was no incremental data center revenue from the acquired businesses during other revenues are primarily related to the sale of third party hardware and software that is used in connection with our products 
other revenue fluctuates based on the mix of products and services sold 
direct costs and gross margins 
direct costs decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for overall gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall decrease in direct costs and corresponding increase in gross margins resulted from reductions in employee headcount and higher cost outside contractors  and reduced facilities costs resulting from the consolidation of offices  offset by the added costs of the acquired businesses 
direct costs exclude charges for depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of purchased technology 
costs of software licenses for our financial institution software products are generally minimal because we internally develop most of the software components  the cost of which is reflected in product development expense as it is incurred 
we anticipate that costs of software licenses will increase in future periods as we license and install more of our new s enterprise products because these products include some software components that we license from third parties  however  the costs of software licenses will continue to vary with the mix of products sold 

table of contents costs of professional services  support and maintenance consist primarily of personnel and related infrastructure costs 
direct costs associated with professional services  support and maintenance were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from this decrease resulted from reductions in professional services headcount  outside contractors and associated facilities costs to a level that is more closely aligned with the projects and services under contract  offset by the added costs of the acquired businesses 
gross margins for professional services and customer support and maintenance increased due to the cost reductions and the revenue mix between lower margin professional services and higher margin support revenues 
costs of data center consist of personnel costs  facility costs and related infrastructure costs to support our data center business 
direct data center costs decreased million to million for from million for the decrease resulted from reductions in personnel  outside contractors and purchases of non capital equipment 
for  the gross margin for data center was  a decrease from for this decrease is attributable to declining revenues against the fixed costs of the data center 
significant portions of the data center costs are fixed and are difficult to reduce or eliminate proportionally with declining revenues 
we will be consolidating our uk data center operations into our global hosting center in atlanta in during the third and fourth quarters of  we expect data center costs to decrease as a result of the consolidation 
selling and marketing 
for the year ended december   selling and marketing expenses were million  an increase of million or over this increase is primarily attributable to the added costs of the acquired businesses approximately million plus costs associated with the strengthening of our internal sales force 
these additional costs were offset by a million reduction in spending on marketing programs and a million reduction in bad debt expense 
during  we invested in sales and marketing activities to increase our market share and promote our s enterprise products 
our marketing efforts include participating in and exhibiting at industry conferences and trade shows  maintaining memberships in key industry organizations and maintaining close relationships with industry analysts to help guide product development and marketing efforts 
product development 
total product development expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for added product development costs from the acquired businesses were offset by cost savings achieved through reductions of product development personnel  from replacing outside contractors in our domestic operations with lower cost offshore contractors and from the consolidation of multiple development organizations into eight centers of development excellence 
in the second half of  we significantly reorganized our development organization 
we streamlined development activities to eliminate redundancies and we established centers of development excellence that focus on development and delivery of specific components of our product offerings 
overall  product development head count including employees and offshore contractors remained constant over the and our product development efforts are focused on enhancing the s enterprise suite of products 
in spring of  we delivered the initial release of the s enterprise applications 
throughout the rest of the year we have continued with enhancements and subsequent releases 
additionally  we are enhancing existing products and services by developing new functions and features across our entire product line 
during  we established a relationship with an indian based development organization to outsource portions of our product development 
in  we expanded this relationship and established a development center in india 
we believe this has optimized available research and development resources 
historically we have not capitalized software development costs because of the insignificant amount of costs incurred between technological feasibility and general customer release 
however  if we reach technological feasibility earlier in the development cycle  we may be required to capitalize certain software development costs in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the decrease in general and administrative expenses resulted principally from a decrease in compensation and benefits relative to lower headcount  recruiting fees and professional fees  offset by the added costs of the acquired businesses approximately million and costs incurred to improve our internal systems 
during  we reduced our general and administrative headcount and our use of external resources 

table of contents depreciation 
depreciation decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease was due to reductions in capital expenditures during and as compared with those made in and a significant portion of those items that we bought in and  especially those related to the build out of our global data centers  became fully depreciated by the end of this decrease was offset partially by the added depreciation expense of the acquired businesses of approximately million 
merger related and restructuring costs 
during  we recorded merger related costs of million  a decrease of million from million for during  we incurred merger related costs of million in connection with the acquisition of point 
these costs  incurred in connection with our plan to reorganize certain of our european operations  include headcount reduction  consolidation of s and acquired point office facilities and disposal of redundant or obsolete computer equipment 
this merger related charge was partially offset by a million decrease in a reserve for legal claims  which was established in connection with our acquisition of fics group  nv in november we were able to resolve this legal matter during the first quarter of for less than previously estimated amounts 
our restructuring and merger related reserves include provisions for obligations for unused office space less estimates for sub lease income 
when we secure sub tenants  we adjust our reserves accordingly 
during the second quarter of  we approved a restructuring plan to streamline our european operations 
in connection with this plan  we reduced our european workforce by people and consolidated most of our european operations into two locations 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million for the estimated costs associated with the restructuring plan 
also in  we recorded a charge of million to increase our restructuring reserves that initially were established during the fourth quarter of as a result of a softening in the domestic real estate markets  we determined our original estimate of costs to dispose of or sublet our unused real estate was below the currently anticipated costs 
additionally  during  in connection with the closing of certain office facilities  we wrote off leasehold improvements of million  which were not previously anticipated in the initial restructuring accrual 
during  we released merger related accruals of million related to changes in estimates relative to pending or threatened litigation 
we expect to record costs during related to various restructuring activities including the closing of our uk data center as previously discussed 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the purchase price allocation for the regency and point acquisitions during the year ended december   we allocated million to acquired in process research and development  which we expensed immediately in accordance with the applicable accounting rules 
amortization of acquisition intangible assets 
amortization of acquisition intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we stopped recording amortization expense on goodwill and assembled workforce 
this reduced our amortization expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  certain intangibles related to the acquisition of fics in became fully amortized 
the additional amortization of other intangible assets from the acquired businesses of million more than offset the reduction in amortization expense from the fully amortized intangibles 
during the first quarter of  we will fully amortize the other intangible assets of q up systems 
the completion of the amortization periods of fics and q up systems will reduce our amortization expense for by approximately million 
interest  investment and other income 
interest  investment and other income  net was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from this decrease resulted from the following a non cash charge of million we recorded during to write down our basis in certain equity investments accounted for on a cost basis as a result of impairment in the value of these assets which we believe is other than temporary  offset by a gain of million on the sale of investment securities available for sale we recorded during  a million decrease in interest income during the year ended december  due to a decrease in average cash to invest and a decrease in interest rates from the prior year period  and a decrease in other items totalling approximately million 
loss on sale of subsidiaries and equity in net loss of affiliate 
on january   we sold our verticalone subsidiary to yodlee in a stock for stock transaction in which we received an ownership interest of approximately in yodlee 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a loss on sale of million  which represented the difference between the 
table of contents carrying value of verticalone and the appraised value of our interest in yodlee 
during the year ended december   we recorded non cash charges of million based on our equity interest in the net loss of the affiliate  amortization of the underlying goodwill and other intangible assets  and a write down in the basis of our investment in yodlee 
see further discussion of our investment in yodlee in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since our share of yodlee s underlying net assets was at december  and we have not made any commitments to yodlee to provide additional funding  we did not record our share of yodlee s operating results in  and we will not record our share of any future operating results until our basis in yodlee increases above  if ever 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately million in connection with the sale of a small european subsidiary 
income tax benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million during the year ended december  compared to million for the income tax benefit resulted from a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of fics offset by foreign income tax expense incurred in certain european countries 
the decrease in the benefit is principally attributable to the decrease in the amortization of the fics intangible assets as described above as well as increases in taxable income in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
because the fics intangible assets are fully amortized  we do not expect to record an income tax benefit in although we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards  we may be required to record an income tax provision for certain foreign subsidiaries which do not have net operating loss carryforwards to utilize 
loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of from a loss of million for this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense recorded in the year ended december  this decrease was a combination of ceasing depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of other intangible assets on june  as a result of the accounting treatment for assets held for sale  and ceasing amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce under the provisions of sfas no 
which we adopted on january  revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for revenues decreased as a result of poor economic conditions in the primary markets served by edify telecommunications  retail and travel 
this was partially offset by the revenue from non financial customers of the acquired point business 
direct costs and operating expenses increased as a result of the inclusion of the point non financial institution business and a change in the mix of products sold  offset by decreases in selling and marketing and product development expenses as a result of cost alignment actions taken in the second and third quarters of during the third and fourth quarters of  we identified and corrected two accounting matters from that occurred in our discontinued operations which reduced net income for by approximately million 
one of the matters resulted in the improper recognition of million in revenue during the other matter resulted in the understatement of certain operating expenses totaling million during these matters were in our discontinued operations and had the effect of increasing our loss per share from discontinued operations and our net loss per share by per share during the year ended december  these matters did not affect our revenues  expenses or loss from continuing operations 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
total revenues from continuing operations increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for  an increase of 
the increase in revenues resulted principally from increases in our software licenses  support and maintenance and data center fees 
during the year ended december   software license revenue increased million  or  support and maintenance revenue increased million  or  and data center revenue increased million  or 
a portion of this growth is related to the inclusion of a full year of activity for davidge and q up  both of which were acquired in april and the inclusion of sdi for the fourth quarter of additionally  our revenues increased as a result of the inclusion of the frs business unit during  which was previously classified as available for sale during these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our professional services revenues  which during the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million 
although professional services revenue from our major domestic customer declined during  we continued to provide a substantial amount of implementation  hosting and product enhancement services to this customer 
we derived and of our revenues from continuing operations in and  respectively  from this customer

acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of q up  regency and point  we allocated a portion of the respective purchase prices to acquired in process research and development based on appraisals prepared by independent valuation consultants 
we determined the fair value of in process research and development for each of the above acquisitions using an income approach 
this involved estimating the present value of the after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates and revenue forecasts as appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows related to the in process research and development were made for each project based on our estimates of revenue  operating expenses and income taxes from the project 
these estimates were consistent with historical pricing  margins and expense levels for similar products 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
estimated operating expenses include cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the research and development expenses include estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market 
the selection of the discount rate was based on consideration of our weighted average cost of capital  as well as factors including the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances that were known at the time  and the stage of completion of each technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts represent fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would have paid for the projects 
at the date of acquisition  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the values allocated to these projects were immediately expensed upon acquisition 
where appropriate  we deducted an amount reflecting the contribution of developed technology to the anticipated cash flows of in process research and development projects 
the acquisitions and related in process research and development expenses are detailed in the table below in process costs to company acquisition date purchase price r d expense complete in millions q up april  regency systems february  point march  at the date of acquisition  regency was working on an ivr system for the nt platform  known as v although this technology includes all of the same features of the developed system  it is based on an entirely new code  and includes additional features 
we released this new product at the end of within the estimated costs and timeline used in the valuation 
as of the acquisition date  point had two projects under development e point version for windows nt and e point version for unix 
e point version incorporates additional functionalities to the existing platform 
at the time of acquisition  conceptualization for version was complete  however it had not progressed through the development cycle 
e point unix has the same features as existing point technology  but for use an interconnectivity with unix operating systems 
at the time of acquisition  the coding  prototyping and stabilization of the e point unix project was not complete 
both of these projects were completed during the first quarter of within the anticipated costs and timelines

through december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million under this program 
we completed this repurchase program in the first quarter of in and  we received million and million from the sale of common stock under our employee stock plans  respectively 
we paid million and million for capital lease obligations in and in  we repaid borrowings of million 
in  we entered into an arrangement for a million secured line of credit with a bank 
during  the secured line of credit expired 
as of december   we do not have any borrowing arrangements 
in  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of preferred stock and million from the sale of our common stock under employee stock plans 
this was partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations of million and million payment on notes payable 
commitments 
in connection with the lease of certain offices  we issued to our landlord a standby letter of credit in the amount of million to guarantee certain obligations under the lease agreement 
the amount of the letter of credit reduces as our rent obligation declines 
at december   there were no drawings outstanding under the letter of credit 
we lease office space and computer equipment under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through we also lease certain computer equipment under capital lease arrangements 
future minimum payments under 
table of contents operating and capital leases  net of operating sublease income  are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
we believe that our expected cash flows from operations together with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if cash generated from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or issue debt securities or establish an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the addition of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the foreign currency financial statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates  except revenues and expenses  which are translated at average exchange rates during each reporting period 
net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of our international operations to us dollars in consolidation 
at this time  we do not use financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure because the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations would not be material 
the net assets of our foreign operations at december  were approximately million 
for our operations located in countries participating in the european union  we adopted the euro as our common legal currency effective january  on january   all countries participating in the european union began using the euro as their currency 
we have not experienced any significant problems related to the euro conversion and the euro conversion did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
our capital lease obligations include only fixed rates of interest 
therefore  we do not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates relating to our capital lease obligations
