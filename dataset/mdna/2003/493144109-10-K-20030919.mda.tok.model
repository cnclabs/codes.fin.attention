item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue primarily when products are shipped 
staff accounting bulletin states that revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured the company believes that it meets the above criteria for the following reasons customer purchase orders confirming the price and shipping terms are required prior to shipment 
the terms of the company s sales are generally fob shipping point  meaning that the customer takes ownership of the goods and assumes the risk of loss when the goods leave the company s premises 
the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable as noted  we require a customer purchase order  which confirms the price and shipping terms 
collectibility is reasonably assured the credit terms for customers are pre established so that collection of the account can be reasonably assured 
inactive  obsolete and surplus inventory reserve the company reserves for inventories that it deems inactive  obsolete or surplus 
this reserve is calculated based upon the demand for the products that the company produces 
demand is determined by expected sales or customer forecasts 
if expected sales do not materialize  then the company would have inventory in excess of their reserves and would have to charge the excess against future earnings 
in the case where the company has purchased material based upon a customer s forecast  the company is usually covered by lead time assurance agreements with each customer 
these contracts state that the financial liability for material purchased within lead time and based upon the customer s forecasts  lies with the customer 
if the company purchases material outside the lead time assurance agreement and the customer s forecasts do not materialize  the company would have the financial liability and would have to charge the excess against future earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company values its accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is based on estimates of the portion of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future  and the amount of this allowance is disclosed in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the estimates used are based primarily on specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
such accounts are identified using publicly available information in conjunction with evaluations of current payment activity 
however  if any of the company s customers were to develop unexpected and immediate financial problems that would prevent payment of open invoices  the company could incur additional and possibly material expenses that would negatively impact earnings 
accrued warranty an accrual is made for expected warranty costs  with the related expense recognized in cost of good sold 
management reviews the adequacy of this accrual quarterly based on historical analysis and anticipated product returns 
over the course of the past three years  the company s warranty expense has decreased 
the declines in warranty expense and the related accrual account are directly related to the change in the composition of the company s revenue from keyboards to ems 
as the company has made the transition from manufacturing only keyboards to ems  its exposure to warranty issues has declined significantly 
the company s warranty period for keyboards is generally longer than that for ems products 
also the company does not warrant design defects for ems customers 
results of operations fiscal year fiscal year sales decreased from fiscal year the decrease is due primarily to a slowdown in shipments to some of the company s larger ems customers for a variety of reasons 
keyboard sales decreased approximately million or 
ems sales also decreased by million or 
during fiscal years and  the company was involved in litigation that resulted in a judgment in which negatively affected the ability to acquire new business 
the company has seen an increase in new business upon the elimination of this uncertainty in and expects this trend to continue

revenue from keyboard sales decreased million or from fiscal while revenue from ems sales increased million or 
even though keyboard sales continue to decline  the margins on these sales usually exceed those that can be realized on ems sales  so the company will continue to service this industry until such time that it is no longer feasible or profitable to do so

ems sales were of total revenue in fiscal compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
keyboard sales were of sales in fiscal compared to and of total sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
cost of sales in fiscal year  cost of sales was of revenues compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease in was due primarily to improvements in operating efficiencies and lower material costs

the decline in warranty expense is attributable primarily to the decline in keyboard sales 
the company s warranty period for keyboards is generally longer than that for ems products 
also the company does not warrant design defects for ems customers 
cost of sales also includes shipping and handling costs of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the company s freight costs for inbound shipments of production materials fluctuate from year to year depending on negotiated freight rates and the necessity for expedited shipping methods

as a percentage of sales  these expenses were   and  respectively 
in fiscal years   and  the company focused most of its rd e efforts on ems programs

selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were   and  respectively 
the decreases in fiscal year compared to fiscal year were due primarily to a reduction in promotional programs and marketing expenses related to keyboard sales 
the significant decrease in selling expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to a large drop in keyboard sales 
sales of keyboards through distribution require greater promotional and marketing programs than sales of ems products 
in addition  the company did not employ outside sales representatives for its keyboard products in fiscal year  so commission expense was significantly decreased 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to a year over year decline in legal expenses as a result of the termination of the f g litigation 
other contributing factors were a decreased provision for doubtful accounts  lower telephone expenses  decreased staffing in ireland  and the adoption of sfas  which ceased the amortization of goodwill 
the decrease between fiscal years and was due primarily to a significant decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts and decreased compensation and fringe benefits as a result of attrition and a reduction in salaries 
interest expense the company had interest expenses of million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year was due to a significant decrease in the company s interest rates applied to its revolving debt 
the major factor in the interest rates was the decrease in bank prime rates

other income  net the company had net other income of   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
other income in fiscal year is primarily proceeds from the sale of an equity security 
the net other income for fiscal year is primarily the result of recognizing gains on the sale of two of the company s buildings

in december of  the company sold its headquarters building in spokane  washington  under a sale lease back transaction 
the company did not recognize the gain on the sale of the headquarters building during the time period that it had guaranteed the rent on the second floor of the building 
at the end of december  the one year of guaranteed rent payments was fulfilled  and the company recognized a gain of  note from the sale of this building 
the difference between these gains and the reported amount of  is due to miscellaneous non operating expenses 
the other income in was primarily due to gains from the sale of fixed assets 
income taxes the company had income tax expense of  in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the current year s expense is primarily the result of tax provisions on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the large increase in income tax expense in fiscal year was due primarily to establishing a valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax assets after a litigation judgment was awarded to f g scrolling mouse 
these assets totaled million 
prior to the award of this judgment  key tronic had almost million in tax loss carry forwards 
financial accounting standard no 
requires that management assess the sources of future taxable income  which may be available to recognize the deductible differences that comprise deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
because the litigation judgment was considered evidence of the company s possible inability to utilize the balance of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance was increased to the full value 
the company s tax loss carry forwards begin expiring in the remaining  of the company s income tax provision was due to income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the income tax expense in fiscal year was also due to income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries

this subsidiary is primarily used to support the company s us operations 
the company s mexican subsidiary  key tronic reynosa sa de cv  leases a manufacturing facility in reynosa  mexico 
this subsidiary is used exclusively to manufacture products for one ems customer 

table of contents key tronic europe  ltd 
ktel  the company s operation in dundalk  ireland  is primarily used to solicit sales and support customers within europe 
the keyboards previously manufactured in dundalk  ireland to support the european market are now assembled at the shanghai  china facility

foreign sales were of net sales in fiscal compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales from key tronic europe  ltd 
represented approximately of consolidated sales to external customers in fiscal year compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in foreign sales for fiscal year is primarily the result of declining sales to the foreign subsidiaries of one ems customer and the continuing decline of keyboard sales from the company s subsidiary in ireland 
although the company hopes to expand its ems business to include the european market  sales within europe currently are primarily for electronic keyboards 
key tronic computer peripheral co  ltd  the company s subsidiary in shanghai  china  did not have any sales to local customers during fiscal year in fiscal years and  sales to local customers were  and million  respectively 
the decrease in sales to local chinese customers is also the result of lower purchases from the same ems customer as previously discussed 
capital resources and liquidity the company used 
million of cash from operating activities in fiscal year versus 
million and million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years and  respectively 
the cash used in fiscal year was due primarily to a significant increase in inventory levels 
the increase in inventories was from a ramp up for new ems programs  and from an increase in the company s printed circuit board business 
printed circuit board production requires higher material content than most other ems programs currently in production 
also contributing to the use of cash was the amount paid to f g under the settlement agreement signed during fiscal year offsetting the uses in cash was a reduction in accounts receivable due to reduced sales in fiscal year the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due primarily to the reduction of accounts payable 
the significant increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was due primarily to the collection of trade receivables 
capital expenditures were million  million  and 
million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures for fiscal year was primarily due to the purchase of new production equipment in the las cruces  new mexico facility 
the company s cash position decreased by

on november  a third amendment to the financing agreement was signed 
the amendment contains financial covenants that relate to total equity  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and a minimum fixed charge ratio 
the amendment also extended the term of the agreement by one year 
the agreement became effective on august   and will now terminate on august  as of june   the company was in compliance with all loan covenants 
at june   the outstanding revolving loan balance was  compared to  at fiscal year end june  the increase in the loan balance was due primarily to required payments to f g in compliance with the settlement of the legal judgment in the second quarter of fiscal in addition to the company s revolving credit facility payment obligations and normal operating expenses  at june   the company had a million litigation settlement payment obligation  and operating lease commitments of approximately  per month for the remainder of the fiscal year 
the company believes that funds available under the revolving credit facility and internally generated funds can satisfy cash requirements for a period in excess of months 

table of contents contractual obligations in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts  which obligate the company to make payments in the future 
the table below sets forth the company s significant future obligations by time period 
payments due by fiscal years long term contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt operating leases litigation total risks and uncertainties that could affect future results the following risks and uncertainties could affect the company s actual results and could cause results to differ materially from past results or those contemplated by the company s forward looking statements 
when used herein  the words expects  believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future due to a variety of factors  including changes in overall demand for customers products  success of customers programs  timing of new programs  new product introductions or technological advances by the company  its customers and its competitors and changes in pricing policies by the company  its customers  its suppliers and its competitors 
for example  the company relies on customers forecasts to plan its business 
if those forecasts are overly optimistic  the company s revenues and profits may fall short of expectations 
conversely  if those forecasts are too conservative  the company could have an unexpected increase in revenues and profits 
the products which the company manufactures for its customers have relatively short product lifecycles  therefore the company s business  operating results and financial condition are dependent in significant part on the company s ability to obtain orders from new customers and new product programs from existing customers 
competition the ems industry is intensely competitive 
competitors may offer customers lower prices on certain high volume programs 
this could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s inability to provide comparable or better manufacturing services at a lower cost than its competitors could cause sales to decline 
in addition  competitors can copy the company s non proprietary designs after the company has invested in development of products for customers  thereby enabling such competitors to offer lower prices on such products due to savings in development costs 
concentration of major customers at present  the company s customer base is highly concentrated and could become even more concentrated 
the company s largest ems customer accounted for of net sales in fiscal year this same customer accounted for of sales in three other of the company s ems customers accounted for   and of net sales during fiscal year these same customers accounted for   and of net sales in fiscal year and   and in fiscal year there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products from the company at current levels 
moreover  the company typically does not enter into long term volume purchase contracts with its customers  and the company s customers have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders 
the loss of one or more of the company s major customers  or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from such customers  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on suppliers the company is dependent on many suppliers  including sole source suppliers  to provide key components and raw materials used in manufacturing customers products 
delays in deliveries from suppliers or the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and raw materials could cause delays or reductions in shipment of products to our customers which could adversely affect the company s operating results and damage customer relationships 

table of contents dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
the competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
foreign manufacturing operations virtually all products manufactured by the company are produced at the company s facilities located in mexico and china 
accordingly the company s operations are subject to a variety of risks unique to international operations including import and export duties and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws and foreign economic and political risk 
technological change and new product risk the markets for the company s customers products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life cycles 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company s success will depend upon its customers ability to enhance existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address evolving and increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
failure of the company s customers to do so could substantially harm the company s customers competitive positions 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing products that respond to technological change  emerging industry standards or evolving customer requirements 
dilution and stock price volatility as of june   there were outstanding options for the purchase of approximately  shares of common stock of the company common stock  of which options for approximately  shares were vested and exercisable 
holders of the common stock will suffer immediate and substantial dilution to the extent outstanding options to purchase the common stock are exercised 
the stock price of the company may be subject to wide fluctuations and possible rapid increases or declines over a short time period 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company such as variations in quarterly operating results or changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors relating to the ems and computer industries or to the securities markets in general  which  in recent years  have experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded
