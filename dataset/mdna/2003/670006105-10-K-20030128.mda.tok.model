critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires the company to make an accounting estimate based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially change the financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition 
the company s it consulting business derives a portion of its revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope  and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method  using time to completion to measure the percent complete with revisions to estimates novell annual report 
table of contents reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  future consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations 
the company records a provision against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
the company also records a provision to other expenses for bad debts resulting from customers inability to pay for the products or services they have received  due to such factors as bankruptcy 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and bad debt data  analysis of credit memo data  and other known factors 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns or bad debts  revenue or net income could be over or understated 
long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include fixed assets  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
at october   the company s long lived assets included million of net fixed assets  million of long term investments  million of goodwill  million of identifiable intangible assets  and million of current and non current net deferred tax assets 
property  plant and equipment 
the company periodically reviews its property  plant and equipment for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  the company must make assumptions regarding recoverability of costs  estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that its facilities in san jose  california and a small building in provo  utah had become impaired due to changes in the intended use of the facilities  as well as changes in the local commercial real estate market 
this resulted in a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million 
depending upon relevant factors  such as the continuing decline in real estate market conditions  or the company s decision to change its intentions for the facilities and place them for sale  the company could be required to record further impairment charges 
long term investments 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependant on the actual financial performance of the companies or venture funds in which the company has invested  the investee s market value  and the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these private equity investments  the company considers these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of its investees  liquidation preference value of the stock novell holds  and estimated potential for investment recovery based on all these factors 
if any of these factors indicate that the investment has become other than temporarily impaired  the company may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
during fiscal  the company recognized million of impairment losses related to its long term investments 
if general market conditions do not improve  or if any of the companies or venture funds included in long term investments do not meet performance goals  the company s investments could become other than temporarily impaired as their values decline  causing the company to record further investment impairment charges 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and was  therefore  required to perform an novell annual report 
table of contents impairment test on its goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
the company s initial goodwill impairment analysis was completed during the second quarter of fiscal  and was based on november  balances 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge of million related to goodwill in its it consulting reporting unit 
subsequently  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed its annual impairment review based on august  balances and determined that there was no impairment as of that date 
however  changes in the assumptions used in the analysis could have changed the resulting outcome 
for example  to estimate the fair value of the company s reporting units  management made estimates and judgments about future cash flows based on the company s fiscal forecast and current long range plans used to manage the business 
these long range estimates could change in the future depending on internal changes in the company as well as external factors 
future changes in estimates could possibly result in a non cash goodwill impairment that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as a part of the silverstream acquisition  the company determined that it had acquired developed technology related to silverstream s extend products that were currently shipping and could be combined with novell products and services 
the value of this intangible asset was determined using expected future cash flows for the extend products as well as the combined products  and an estimated discount factor to account for risks associated with the product business and future versions of the extend products 
the company also periodically reviews its identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of sfas in determining whether an intangible asset is impaired  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if the estimates or the related assumptions used to determine the value of the intangible assets change  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for example  if the company were to abandon its products which integrate the extend web based technology that was acquired from silverstream  or if the sales forecasts for these secure web services products were to change  the company could be required to record an impairment charge in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  including the company s financial performance and general market conditions 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
during fiscal  the company increased the valuation allowance by million against various deferred tax assets  including assets from the silver stream acquisition  capital losses resulting from investment impairments  and foreign tax credits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets  resulting in additional income tax expense recorded in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations acquisitions silverstream software  inc pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of june  by and among novell  delaware planet  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of novell delaware planet  and silverstream  delaware planet commenced a cash tender offer on june  to acquire all of the outstanding shares of silverstream common stock at a price of per share 
on july   delaware planet announced the completion of its cash tender offer  pursuant to which it purchased almost all of the outstanding shares of silverstream common stock at a price of per share 
on july   novell completed its acquisition of silverstream by merging delaware planet into silverstream 
novell annual report 
table of contents at the closing date of the merger  there were  shares of silverstream common stock outstanding  resulting in a total cash acquisition price of million 
direct transaction costs were estimated to be million and the fair value of silverstream stock options assumed  both vested and unvested  totaled million 
with respect to stock options assumed as a part of the merger  all silverstream options  vested and unvested  were exchanged for novell options with the same terms and vesting characteristics 
the fair value of these options was included in the acquisition purchase price 
the portion of the intrinsic value related to unvested options that will be earned over the remaining vesting period of those options has been deducted from the fair value of the unvested options and recorded as deferred compensation 
this deferred compensation will be amortized over the remaining vesting period of approximately two years  in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no

in total  options to purchase approximately million shares of silverstream common stock were converted into options to purchase approximately million shares of novell common stock using a conversion ratio of

sfas  business combinations 
there are no other outstanding contingencies that could affect the allocation 
goodwill from the acquisition resulted from the company s belief that the technology silverstream had developed is valuable to the company s secure web services product offerings 
the company also believed it was more beneficial to acquire such technology rather than to develop it in house 
the goodwill from the silverstream acquisition has been allocated to the company s product segment as the extend product suite will be included with the net directory services group of products 
in accordance with sfas  the company does not amortize goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives resulting from this acquisition  and reviews these assets periodically for potential impairment issues 
goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
novell annual report 
table of contents net tangible assets of silverstream consisted mainly of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  fixed assets  accounts payable  and other liabilities 
the value of deferred compensation of approximately million represents the intrinsic value of the unvested options assumed by novell as determined under the guidance of fin the million of in process research and development pertains to replacement and enhancement technology that will be included in the next versions of the extend product suite and is not currently technologically feasible  meaning it has not reached the working model stage  does not contain all of the major functions planned for the product  and is not ready for initial customer testing 
shortly before the acquisition  silverstream released its latest version of each of its products in the extend suite  thus there was minimal in process research and development at the acquisition date 
in process research and development was valued based on discounting forecasted cash flows directly from the related products 
completion of development of the future upgrades of these products is dependant upon the company delivering its secure web services products and successfully integrating silverstream 
the in process research and development does not have any alternative future use and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
developed technology relates to silverstream s extend products that are currently shipping and can be combined with current novell products and services 
to determine the value of developed technology  the expected future cash flow attributable to the extend products was discounted taking into account risk associated with these assets relative to the in process research and development 
the analysis resulted in a valuation of approximately million for developed technology  which had reached technological feasibility 
the value of trademarks and trade names was determined based on assigning a royalty rate to the revenue streams that were expected from the products using the extend trade names 
the royalty rate was determined based on trade name recognition  marketing support  and contribution of the trade name s value relative to the revenue drivers 
the pre tax royalty rates of percent were applied to the product revenues and discounted to a present value  resulting in a valuation of approximately million 
cambridge technology partners on july   the stockholders of cambridge approved the acquisition of cambridge by novell 
the company issued shares of its common stock for each share of cambridge common stock outstanding on july  the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the fair value of the consideration was approximately million  of which million related to the number of shares exchanged at a per share value of the average closing price of a share of novell common stock for the seven trading day period beginning three days before the announcement date of the acquisition  and million related to direct transaction costs 
the value of the acquisition was allocated as follows in millions adjusted net assets acquired goodwill results of operations for cambridge are included in novell s results of operations beginning july  in accordance with sfas  the company did not amortize the goodwill associated with this acquisition 
in addition  sfas required the company to perform an initial impairment analysis within the first six months following november   the date of adoption 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal and recognized a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million as of november   which was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of operations

the company s chief decision makers  the president and chief executive officer and members of the company s worldwide management committee  evaluate the performance of the company based on operating segment revenue  expenses  and profitability 
separate financial information is not available by segment in regards to asset allocation 
prior to fiscal  the company operated in one operating segment 
product product segment revenue was million of total revenues in fiscal compared to million of total revenues in fiscal  and  million of total revenues in fiscal within the product segment  revenue from net management services products decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in sales of netware  which is a result of declining sales of versions   and that more than offset increased sales of version  a decrease in sales of management and collaboration products  and lower unix royalty revenue from expiring royalty contracts 
revenue from net directory services products increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased revenue from dirxml and single sign on secure login  which have both grown over in fiscal compared to fiscal as these newer products gain traction  and the addition of silverstream revenue for the period of july  through october   which amounted to novell annual report 
table of contents million 
product related service  support  and training remained relatively flat during in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in product revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of the decline in sales of the older netware versions  and  lower management and collaboration product revenue  and lower unix and other royalties  partially offset by sales of netware version and higher net directory services revenue due to a full year of dirxml and ichain sales 
the net management services products represented of total revenue in fiscal compared to of total revenue in fiscal prior to fiscal  the company recognized revenue related to product sales to distribution channel partners upon shipment to the partner and provided a reserve for contractual return obligations and other estimated product returns 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for revenue related to these product sales to recognize such revenues upon the sell through of the respective product from the distribution channel partner to the reseller or end user 
the company believes this change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin the million per share cumulative effect of the change after reduction for income taxes of million was reflected in net income in the first quarter of fiscal also  during the three months ended january   the company recognized million in revenue that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment at november  the effect of that revenue on the first quarter was to increase net income by million per share 
had the company reported under its previous method of accounting for revenue recognition  the effect on earnings  without consideration of the cumulative effect of the change  would be a decrease in earnings of approximately million  or per share  during fiscal volera during fiscal  novell completed the formation of volera  inc as majority owned joint venture among novell  inc  nortel networks corp  and accenture ltd 
prior to  volera was a product group within novell 
revenue from volera was relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal revenue from volera was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal revenue was due primarily to improved sales and marketing efforts 
volera revenues were less than of total revenues in fiscal   and volera s performance did not our meet the growth expectations and thus management determined that the best strategy for volera was to integrate its products and operations back into novell 
on october   the company acquired the outstanding shares of volera held by nortel for million and in november  it acquired the outstanding shares of volera held by accenture for million 
as a result of the acquisition of the minority shares  beginning in fiscal the volera segment has been integrated into the products segment 
consulting consulting revenue was million higher in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the acquisition of cambridge at the end of the third quarter of fiscal cambridge operations were included in the company s operating results for approximately four months in fiscal compared to a full year in fiscal consulting revenue from it consulting services decreased each quarter during the first three quarters of fiscal and remained flat in the last quarter of fiscal compared to the prior quarter due to a weakened services market and decreased demand for the company s systems integration and net business solutions

consulting revenue was of total revenue in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  the company adopted fasb emerging issues task force eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
eitf requires companies to account for reimbursements received for incurred out of pocket expenses as revenue and the related expenses as cost of revenue 
previously they were not included in the statement of operations 
reimbursable expense revenue is now included in consulting revenue in all periods presented 
the company restated the prior periods  thereby increasing consulting revenue and cost of revenue sold million in fiscal prior to fiscal  reimbursed out of pocket expenses were immaterial and included in revenue and cost of revenue 
geographic information international revenue  comprised of revenue to international customers in europe  the middle east  africa  canada  south america  australia  and asia pacific  represented of total revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal during fiscal  international revenue increased while domestic revenue decreased compared to fiscal internationally  revenue increases during the year were due to the addition of cambridge in fiscal  favorable foreign exchange rates  and recovering european market conditions  which resulted in greater demand for the company s products and services 
the slight decrease in domestic revenue during fiscal was largely due to lower revenue in the product segment offset somewhat by higher revenue in the consulting segment due to a full year of cambridge revenue in fiscal international revenue represented of total revenue in fiscal compared to of total revenue in fiscal domestic revenue represented of total revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in international revenue in fiscal was due primarily to the addition of cambridge for a four month period 
the decrease in domestic revenue as a percentage of total revenue was due to increased international sales  declining netware revenue and lower unix royalties  offset somewhat by to the addition of cambridge for a four month period 
forward looking revenue trends although netware revenue improved somewhat in the second half of fiscal due to growth in netware revenue  netware revenue for fiscal was down compared to fiscal the company is working to address the long term growth potential of the netware product line 
in addition  the company is addressing declining revenue in the consulting segment in an effort to improve results in future periods 
as part of these efforts  the company completed its integration of cambridge during the first half of fiscal  and has reorganized its sales force to provide better coverage and resources for its customers and partners  focusing on solving business issues with net business solutions and services 
in addition  the company is continuing to integrate the silverstream products into its offerings and integrating silverstream s operations as deemed appropriate 
the company anticipates that it will take several quarters to fully realize the benefits from these actions 
the company believes the product segment revenues for fiscal will increase approximately over fiscal levels  partially as a result of having a full year of silverstream product revenue  and partially due to increases in management and collaboration products and net directory services revenue  offset somewhat by continued decreases in overall netware revenue 
the company does not expect to see an increase in the demand for it consulting services over the next few quarters as the economy stabilizes and companies slowly start to increase investments in technology solutions 
celerant management consulting is expected to grow approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal at october   the company had million of deferred revenue representing revenue that will be recognized in future periods 
the majority of this deferred revenue relates to maintenance contracts  which novell annual report 
table of contents are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
the company has either received payment or recorded a receivable for the deferred revenue  and has determined collectability to be reasonably certain 
direct costs incurred to fulfill these maintenance obligations are relatively small and are recognized as work is performed 
gross profit change change gross profit millions percentage of revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal compared to  and in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the effects of a higher mix of lower margin consulting business along with decreased product revenue levels 
the mix between product revenue and consulting revenue has shifted due to the acquisition of cambridge in july  causing product revenue to become a smaller percentage of total revenue 
during fiscal  gross margin for the consulting segment was compared to for the product segment 
the low consulting margins are primarily due to increased consulting competition  reduced billing rates  and increased costs related to excess consultants who were not fully utilized on consulting engagements 
product margins increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal this increase is due primarily to better inventory management and lower royalty costs 
the company does not expect overall gross profit margins to return to fiscal levels in the future due to the increase in the consulting business as a percentage of total revenue 
margins in the consulting industry  in general  are lower than those in the software industry 
the company does believe that the current overall gross profit margin of is too low and should be at least in the to range or better and management is currently exploring alternatives to improve the gross margin percentage in future periods  such as improving utilization and increasing consulting billing rates 
as described above  the company adopted eitf  which requires companies to account for reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue and the related expenses as cost of revenue 
this change did not have a significant effect on gross margin

at the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that there were indicators of impairment related to its facility in san jose  california and a small building in provo  utah due to changes in the intended novell annual report 
table of contents use of the facilities  as well as changes in the local real estate market 
the company then performed an analysis of each of the property s future undiscounted cash flows and determined that their estimated future cost recovery was lower than the recorded net book value of the assets recorded by the company 
based on the results of this analysis  the company obtained an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of these locations 
based on the fair value of these facilities as determined by the independent appraisals  the company recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million 
both of the impaired facilities are classified as held and used as the company does not have immediate plans to sell them 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million 
the charge was a result of the company s continued move towards its business strategy of improving the company s status as a net business solutions provider  addressing changes in the market due to technology changes  and becoming more customer focused

at the end of fiscal  the company recorded million of pre tax  restructuring charges resulting from changes in general market conditions  changing customer demands  and the company s evolution of its business strategy  all of which required the company to restructure its operations 
this business strategy focuses on net business solutions designed to secure and power the networked world across leading operating systems 
the execution of this strategy included refining the company s consulting initiatives  refocusing research and development efforts  defining sales and marketing efforts to be more customer and solutions oriented  and adjusting the overall cost structure given current revenue levels and the company s direction

the company also considered its market capitalization as of august   the date of our testing 
based on the results of its analysis  the company determined that there was no goodwill impairment in any of its reporting units 
changes to the estimates used in the analysis  including estimated future cash flows  could cause one or more of the reporting units to be valued differently in future periods 
future analysis could possibly result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of up to million  depending on the estimated value of the segments and the value of the net assets attributable to those segments at that time 
any further impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations

the company also invests excess cash in long term investments through the novell venture account  cambridge technology capital fund i lp ctc i  and direct investments in long term private equity securities 
investments made through the novell venture account and ctc i generally are in private companies  including small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  and expansion stage private companies 
within the novell venture account there are also investments in venture capital funds that are managed largely by external venture capitalists 
ctc i is managed internally 
the value of the investments made through the novell venture account and ctc i is dependent on the performance  successful acquisition  and or initial public offering of the investees

during fiscal  the company generated million of cash flow from operations  and anticipates generating positive cash flows from operations in addition to investment income in fiscal sufficient to fund operations 
the company anticipates being able to fund its current operations  any future acquisitions  any further integration  restructuring or any merger related costs  and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future with existing cash and short term investments together with cash generated from operations and investment income 
the company believes that borrowings under the company s credit facilities or offerings of equity or debt securities are possible if the need arises  although such offerings may not be available to the company on acceptable terms  given current market conditions 
investments will continue in product development and in new and existing areas of technology 
cash may also be used to acquire technology through purchases and strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures in fiscal are anticipated to be approximately million  but could be reduced if the growth of the company is less than presently anticipated 
during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors extended the company s stock repurchase program through june  and authorized the use of up to million for the repurchase of additional outstanding shares of the company s common stock

this statement also established that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of the sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the company adopted this statement in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in no effect on its results of operations 
novell annual report 
table of contents factors affecting future results of operations novell s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
a number of these risks and uncertainties are discussed below 
the current economic climate and outlook in the technology and information technology services sector is very weak  causing our business to suffer the weakened global economic climate  particularly in the technology sector  has had an adverse effect on novell s stock price and ability to sell products and services 
future economic projections for this sector do not anticipate a quick recovery 
a continuation of the weakened global economy could have further negative effects on novell s stock price and ability to sell products and services in the future 
our financial and operating results may vary  negatively affecting our ability to detect trends novell often experiences a higher volume of revenue at the end of each quarter and during novell s fourth quarter 
because of this  fixed costs that are out of line with revenue levels may not be detected until late in any given quarter and results of operations could be adversely affected 
operating results have been  and may also be  affected by other factors including  but not limited to timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers  product mix  including a shift from higher margin to lower margin products or services  delays or problems with our fulfillment agents  impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the price of our products in international locations  inability to respond to the decline in revenue through the distribution channel  inability to derive benefits from the restructurings and our corporate strategy  and inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers and systems integration partners 
we may not be able to successfully compete in a challenging market for computer software and consulting services the market for networking applications and solutions as well as it consulting is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to continue to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants 
we believe that competitive factors common to all of our operating segments include our ability to sell both products and services as part of an overall solution  the breadth of our offerings  the pricing of our products and services  and the timing and market acceptance of new solutions developed by us and our competitors 
product and volera segments in addition to the factors listed above  key competitive factors in the product and volera segments include brand and product awareness  the performance  reliability and security of our products  the ability to preserve our legacy customer base  the completeness of our suite of product and solutions offerings  our ability to establish and maintain key strategic relationships with distributors  resellers and other partners  and the pricing strategies of our competitors 
our key competitors in the product and volera segments include microsoft  ibm  bea systems  sun microsystems  altiris  netegrity  computer associates and critical path 
novell annual report 
table of contents consulting segments the key competitive factors faced by the consulting segment are attracting and retaining the highest quality consultants  the depth of our skills and expertise  the breadth of consulting capabilities  and having expertise in key functional areas 
the market for consulting services is highly competitive due to the existence of several large consulting firms specializing in the information systems area such as ibm  accenture  eds and microsoft 
many of these companies have greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the consulting area  which could inhibit the company s ability to grow its consulting business 
additionally  the worldwide marketplace for consulting services is highly fragmented 
in different regions of the world  there may be multiple competitors  many with niche consultancies 
general we do not have the product breadth and market power of microsoft 
microsoft s ability to ship networking products with features and functionality that compete with ours  together with its ability to offer incentives to customers to purchase certain products in order to obtain favorable sales terms or necessary compatibility or information with respect to other products  may significantly inhibit our ability to grow our business 
microsoft has significant financial resources  which could allow it to aggressively price its products and services for long periods of time to the potential detriment of competitors 
we believe  and the courts have agreed  that microsoft exploits its desktop operating monopoly in anticompetitive ways designed to maintain that monopoly and  in our view  to extend its market power to quash competitive alternatives to microsoft products 
for example  in the past  microsoft has employed tactics that limit or block effective and efficient interoperability with our products 
we will ensure  to the best of our ability  that our products will interoperate with those of microsoft as they enhance new operating systems and applications 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel because of the intense competition for qualified personnel in the computer and consulting industries the ability of novell to maintain its competitive technological position will depend  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified development  consulting  and managerial personnel 
even in light of the current economic downturn  competition for personnel of the highest caliber is intense in the software and consulting industries 
the loss of a significant group of key personnel would adversely affect novell s performance 
the failure to successfully promote and hire suitable replacements in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on novell s business 
if we are not successful in developing a strong business with our extend products and services  our revenues will not grow at the rates we have projected one key element of novell s strategy is to be a leading force in the development of solutions that make the process of developing open standards  web based applications fast  simple  and cost effective 
novell s extend solution set leverages the power of standards such as java and xml to unify relevant information and services while enabling customers to leverage prior technology investments and help them rapidly deliver web based applications that are scalable  reliable and secure 
the acquisition of silverstream helped further novell s development of secure web services products and enhanced its net business solutions product offerings 
novell s ability to achieve success with its extend products and services is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following the growth of the web based applications industry  the acceptance of the extend solution set by clients  development of key extend product solutions and upgrades  and the acceptance of those products by large industry partners and major accounts 
if we are unable to grow the extend products and services to become a major component of our business  our long term growth will be negatively impacted 
novell annual report 
table of contents if we are unable to unify our diverse cultures  the benefits of our solutions strategy may not be fully realized we have a talented  energetic  and exciting group of employees 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  a number of these employees come from diverse corporate cultural backgrounds 
we are in the process of a culture initiative to bring our whole company together towards a new common culture that revolves around our solutions offerings 
if we are not successful in forging a new  vibrant culture with unified goals and a common vision that is solutions based  employee energies may be diverted or diluted and we may not achieve the full benefits of our solutions strategy 
our existing product revenue may deteriorate more rapidly than any increase in sales of our new products novell has several existing products  which it has been selling and upgrading for many years 
sales of these existing products are declining at a faster rate than novell is able to increase sales of new products or technologies 
overall  the products segment revenues declined by million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in revenues from net management services products of million  and only partially offset by an increase in revenues from net directory services products of million 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales of new products or technologies  particularly in our extend solution set and net directory services product line  our long term growth will be negatively impacted 
if we do not generate new customers  our ability to grow our business will be negatively impacted a significant percentage of our revenue is generated from existing customers 
in order to achieve our growth objectives  we must accelerate the rate at which we generate new business 
we have initiated several new sales and marketing initiatives in order to accomplish this goal 
if those initiatives are not successful  our ability to cultivate new customers may be adversely affected 
we have experienced delays in the introduction and acceptance of new products due to various factors as is common in the computer software industry  novell has in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products due to a number of factors  including the complexity of software products  the need for extensive testing of software to ensure compatibility of new releases with a wide variety of application software and hardware devices  and the need to debug products prior to extensive distribution 
significant delays in developing  completing  or shipping new or enhanced products would adversely affect novell 
moreover  novell may experience delays in market acceptance of new releases of its products as novell engages in marketing and education of the user base regarding the advantages of and system requirements for new products and as customers evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of upgrading 
novell has encountered these issues on each major new release of its products  and expects that it will encounter such issues in the future 
novell s ability to achieve desired levels of revenue growth depends at least in part on the successful completion  introduction and sale of new versions of its products 
there can be no assurance that novell will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others  or that novell s research and development efforts will be successful 
should novell experience material delays or revenue shortfalls with respect to new product releases  novell s revenue and net income could be adversely affected 
if third parties claim that we infringed upon their intellectual property  our ability to use some technologies and products could be limited and we may incur significant costs to resolve these claims litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and software industries 
novell has in the past received letters or been the subject of claims suggesting that it is infringing upon the novell annual report 
table of contents intellectual rights of others 
for example  in may a suit was filed by france telecom sa and us philips corporation against novell alleging infringement and seeking unspecified damages and an injunction 
in addition  novell has faced and expects to continue to face from time to time disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
novell expects third party infringement claims involving internet technologies and software products and services to increase because it has become more common for such agencies to be able to find attorneys who are willing to represent them or their clients on a contingency basis 
while novell has no reason to think it would not have strong defenses to such claims  the cost and time of defending itself can be significant 
in addition  novell has agreed  and may agree in the future  to indemnify customers against claims that its products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
novell could incur substantial costs in defending itself and its customers against infringement claims 
if an infringement claim is successful  novell and its customers may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties  and novell may be obligated to pay or reimburse its customers for monetary damages 
in such instances  novell or its customers may not be able to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or at all  and may face delays in product shipment while developing or arranging for alternative technologies 
we may not be able to protect our confidential information  which may adversely affect our business novell generally enters into contractual relationships with its employees that protect its confidential information 
in the event that novell s trade secrets or other proprietary information are misappropriated  novell s business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  novell may not be able to timely detect unauthorized use of its intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce its rights 
in the event novell is unable to enforce these contractual obligations and its intellectual property rights  its business could be adversely affected 
we face increased risks in conducting a global business  which may damage business results novell is a multi national corporation with offices and subsidiaries around the world and  as such  it faces risks in doing business abroad that it does not face domestically 
certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact the operating results of novell  including costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  longer payment cycles  local political and economic conditions  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which can affect demand and increase novell s costs 
some of our short term  long term  and venture capital fund investments have become impaired and additional investments could become impaired novell s investment portfolio includes investments in public equity securities  small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  private companies  and funds managed by venture capitalists 
many of these investments might become other than temporarily impaired 
during its fiscal year  novell recorded an impairment charge of million related to some of the investments in its portfolio whose market value had experienced an other than temporary decline 
as of october   novell had net unrealized gains  novell annual report 
table of contents net of taxes  on investments totaling approximately million  however  there can be no assurances that these gains will be realized and that losses will not occur 
if the companies and funds in which novell has invested suffer poor financial performance  or if the private companies in which novell has invested are not successfully acquired or experience initial public offerings  the value of our investments will decrease 
our existing relationships with other information technology services organizations may be impaired and we could lose business novell maintains relationships with it services organizations that recommend  design and implement solutions for their customers ebusiness that include novell net services products 
at the same time  novell s service offerings compete with those of these same organizations 
although many companies in high technology industries co exist in a similar state of competition  any of these organizations could decide at any time to not continue to do business with us or to recommend our products 
a change in the willingness of these information technology service organizations to do business with novell could adversely affect our business 
our business may be negatively affected if we do not continue to adapt to rapid technological change  evolving business practices and changing consumer requirements the software industry and internet professional services market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving business practices and changing client needs 
accordingly  novell s future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to adapt and meet these challenges 
among the most important challenges facing novell are the need to continue to effectively identify and use leading technologies  develop strategic and technical expertise  influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technology changes and to orient management teams to capitalize on these changes  recruit and retain qualified project personnel  enhance current services  develop new services that meet changing customer needs  and effectively advertise and market net business solutions 
our consulting services contracts contain pricing risks and  if our estimates prove inaccurate  we could lose money novell s it consulting business derives a portion of its revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts 
because of the complex nature of the services provided  it is sometimes difficult to accurately estimate the cost  scope  and duration of particular client engagements 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required for a project  do not accurately assess the scope of work associated with a project  do not manage the project properly  or do not satisfy our obligations in a manner consistent with the contract  then our costs to complete the project could increase substantially 
novell has occasionally had to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  and it may have to take similar action in the future 
novell may not be compensated for these additional costs or the commitment of these additional resources 
additionally  novell s celerant management consulting business derives revenues from projects priced on a contingency basis 
if results are not met  or if a dispute arises  potentially large revenues may not be realized 
novell annual report 
table of contents our it consulting clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with us on short notice if novell s clients cancel or reduce the scope of an engagement with the it consulting business or the celerant management consulting business  novell may be unable to reassign its professionals to new engagements without delay 
personnel and related costs constitute a substantial portion of novell s operating expenses 
because these expenses are relatively fixed  and because novell establishes the levels of these expenses well in advance of any particular quarter  cancellations or reductions in the scope of client engagements could result in the under utilization of novell s professional services employees  causing significant reductions in operating results for a particular quarter 
our stock price will fluctuate novell s future earnings and stock price could be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
due to analysts expectations of continued growth  any shortfall in anticipated earnings can be expected to have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of novell s common stock in any given period 
revenue fluctuations may also contribute to the volatility of the trading price of novell common stock in any given period 
in addition  the market prices for securities of software companies have been  and continues to be  very volatile 
the market price of novell common stock  in particular  has been subject to wide fluctuations in the past 
as a result of the foregoing factors and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of novell s common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations within a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to novell  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer industry or the securities markets in general

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and marketable equity security prices 
to mitigate some of these risks  the company utilizes currency forward contracts and currency options 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  interest rate risk the primary objective of the company s short term investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
the strategy used by the company to achieve this is to invest in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately million decrease less than in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
market risk the company also holds available for sale equity securities in its short term investment portfolio 
as of october   gross unrealized losses  before tax effect on the short term public equity securities totaled million 
a reduction in prices of of these short term equity securities would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of the company s short term investments 
in addition  the company invests in private equity securities  included in its long term portfolio of investments  primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector or venture capital funds 
because of the nature of these investments  the company is exposed to equity price risks 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices of long term equity securities would result in an approximately million decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale long term securities 
foreign currency risk the company uses derivatives to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when remeasured or settled according to accounting principles generally accepted in the us  impact the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs 
all forward contracts entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
gains and losses on these currency forward contracts would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge  resulting in negligible net gain or loss overall on the hedged exposures 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income and expense in the same period as when the gains and losses on remeasurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 
the company s hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if the company did not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement  an increase or decrease of in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this number represents the exposure related to balance sheet remeasurement only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
