this discussion should be read in conjunction with a warning about forward looking statements on page of this annual report 
overview we commenced our operations in and launched our first products  dipstick based pregnancy tests  in the product base and technology platforms have expanded through internal development and acquisitions of other products and technologies 
our primary product areas are currently pregnancy and ovulation  infectious disease  autoimmune diseases  osteoporosis and urinalysis 
we discover  develop  manufacture and market rapid diagnostic products for poc detection 
these products provide simple  accurate and cost effective diagnoses for acute and chronic conditions 
products are sold worldwide to professionals for use in physician offices and clinical laboratories  and to consumers through organizations that provide private label  store brand products 
acquisitions we accounted for each of our acquisitions as a purchase and  as a result  our consolidated statements of operations include the operating results of the acquired businesses from their respective dates of acquisition 
in  we acquired all of the capital stock of litmus for million  based upon the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock  valued at per share 
of the million shares   shares were subject to an escrow agreement for certain representations and warranties  as defined in the merger agreement 
of these escrowed shares   were released to us  due to a cash payment to a third party made on behalf of litmus for financial advisory fees  and the  shares previously in escrow were issued in june in addition  we paid a million license fee to a preferred shareholder of litmus for the co exclusive right to sell litmus products in the us we incurred approximately million in acquisition related costs in and an additional million in in  we also acquired the assets of dade s urine test strip business for million 
of that amount  million was paid in  million was paid in december and million was paid in december in addition to the purchase price for the assets  we agreed to pay dade a royalty on the combined global sales of rapignost for five years after the closing  up to a maximum of million 
as of december   we have accrued approximately million for royalties on the sale of urine test strips 
the funds used to complete the purchase came from a bank line of credit 
the acquired assets include dade s inventory of rapignost urine test strips  product manufacturing equipment  information and know how  trademarks  vendor and customer contracts  distributor agreements  and assignments of certain license agreements 
dade continued to manufacture urine test strips for us through november on a contract basis  and starting in december  we began manufacturing these products ourselves in marburg  germany 
in  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of metra for approximately million in an all cash tender offer 
the total cost of the transaction was approximately million  net of cash acquired from metra of approximately million 
the tender offer was financed from cash reserves  proceeds from a short term bank loan and proceeds from a revolving line of credit 
the short term bank loan was repaid with the cash acquired from metra 
sale and leaseback of facility during  we completed a sale and leaseback transaction for one of our facilities 
the facility was sold for million 
we are leasing the  square foot facility for fifteen years  with options to extend the lease for up to two additional five year periods 
the sale was a cash transaction  netting us approximately million 
we are a limited partner holding approximately interest in the limited partnership that acquired the facility 
the transaction was deemed a financing transaction under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for sales of real estate 
as such  the assets sold remain on our records and will continue to be depreciated over the estimated useful life 
we recorded million as the present value of the net lease payments during the nine months ended december  as a capital lease obligation 
product announcements in july  we launched our quickvue advance ph and amines and quickvue advance g 
vaginalis tests 
this launch represents the first commercial application of quidel s patented ltf technology 
infectious vaginitis is the number one reason why women visit a physician  and accounts for approximately ten million office visits per year 
in september  we announced that our quickvue dipstick strep a test received regulatory approval and a reimbursement code from the japanese ministry of health and welfare  allowing for this test to be sold in japan 
these tests are sold through our japanese distributor  sumitomo seiyaku biomedical co  ltd 
in november  we announced the availability of our urinquick instrument 
this instrument will be used in automating the reading of our quickvue urinchek test strips  thereby enabling the practioner to make timely patient management decisions as an aid in the diagnosis of diabetes  liver and kidney disease  urinary tract infections and other health parameters 
iso certification in december  our san diego facility became iso certified for our quality management systems 
these systems contribute to ensuring that the development  manufacture and supply of products and services are consistent  reliable and valuable in meeting the quality demands of customers 
iso certification is officially recognized by european and north american authorities and is accepted worldwide  and is a requirement for doing business in the european union 
additionally  our santa clara facility was iso certified prior to our acquisition of litmus and both the san diego and santa clara facilities were successfully recertified during and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we changed our accounting policies to implement the effects of sab  which resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million during fiscal year we implemented sab in the fourth quarter of by restating our first three quarters of see accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we changed our method of accounting for product sales and certain milestone payments under joint development agreements 
in an effort to ensure compliance with sab  we reviewed our product sales to ensure that the risks and rewards of ownership passed to our customers 
as a result  we recorded a cumulative adjustment of million related to ensuring the conformity with sab also  we changed our accounting for certain milestone payments under joint development agreements to not recognize revenue until the collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
our milestone payments are considered to be payments received for the accomplishment of a discrete  substantive event 
the non refundable payment arising from the achievement of a defined milestone is recognized as revenue when the performance criteria for that milestone have been met since substantive effort was required to achieve the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment appears reasonable  commensurate with the effort expended and collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
restatement of financial statements we have has restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  as described below 
the restatement adjustment was required to reflect the appropriate accounting treatment for a lease obligation 
in january  we entered into a nine year lease agreement for our manufacturing facility in santa clara  california  whereby the agreement included scheduled rent increases in each succeeding year 
we had originally accounted for the lease payments based on cash paid 
sfas no 
 accounting for leases  requires that operating leases which include scheduled rent increases be accounted for on a straight line basis 
the impact to our net earnings and earnings per share for the year ended december  was a decrease of million or per fully diluted share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements additionally  we have restated the unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the three quarters to the period ended september  and each quarter in the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data year ended december  revenues net sales research contracts  license fees and royalty income total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring acquired in process research and development amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses operating earnings loss other income expense other income interest and other expense total other income expense earnings loss before benefit provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes earnings loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net earnings loss the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year have been restated 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for same period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in demand for our influenza products  offset by decreases in our pregnancy  group a strep and h 
pylori products

pylori product sales decreased approximately million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for same period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in demand for our core products and the launching of new products 
our core products  primarily pregnancy and group a strep tests  increased approximately million and new product sales from influenza a b products increased approximately million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  these increases were offset by a decrease in bone markers  urinalysis  ovulation  and veterinary products in the amounts of million  million  million and million  respectively 
research contracts  license fees and royalty income research contracts  license fees and royalty income remained constant at approximately million for both the years ended december  and the research contracts  license fees and royalty income primarily relates to royalties received on a patented technology of ours utilized by a third party 
the agreement covering the royalty payments extends through november  the expiration date of the patent 
research contracts  license fees and royalty income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was principally related to royalties received on our patented technology utilized by a third party 
cost of sales and gross profit from net sales gross profit from net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit from net sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decreases were primarily due to under utilization of manufacturing capacity at our marburg  germany facility due to the delayed shipment of our urinquick instrument and its related effect on urine test strip sales as well as pricing pressures on our core products  partially offset by increased sales of our higher margin influenza products 
gross profit from net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit from net sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies from increased sales volume as well as product mix changes from sales of higher margin products  such as influenza a b products 
research and development expense research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of net sales remained constant at for both the years ended december  and the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to increased spending for the development of new products on our ltf technology platform related to personnel and laboratory supplies 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote a significant amount of financial resources to research and development for the foreseeable future 
research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decreases are primarily attributable to a decrease in clinical trials in and costs associated with the development of hsv in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increases relate primarily to costs associated with the launch of our infectious vaginitis products  bone ultrasonometer and urinalysis instrument  including infrastructure  public relations  marketing and consulting fees 
sales and marketing decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decreases are primarily due to costs associated with the launch of the urinalysis product and the contract sales force employed to assist with the launch of the influenza a b products during general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decreases were primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with corporate merger and acquisition activity in  partially offset by increased legal and professional fees in general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales remained constant at for the years ended december  and the dollar increase was primarily related to costs associated with corporate merger and acquisition activity in restructuring in the first quarter of  we implemented an expense reduction plan the reduction plan 
the reduction plan included a workforce reduction of approximately employees and closure of our facilities in the united kingdom 
in the first quarter of  we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million related to the reduction plan 
the significant components of the reduction plan were million for employee severance costs and million in closing costs related to the united kingdom facility 
the reduction plan was completed as of the end of the first quarter march  and no amounts were accrued as of december  acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of litmus in december  we acquired research and development projects that had not reached technical feasibility and had no probable alternative future uses 
the amounts allocated to purchased in process research and development for the acquisition were based on independent third party valuations  and were expensed as of the date of the acquisition 
purchased in process research and development expense related to our acquisition of litmus was million for the year ended december  amortization of intangibles on january   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
upon adoption  we reclassified the net book value of our assembled workforce intangible at january   which totaled million  to goodwill 
amortization expense for goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible for the years ended december  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
sfas no 
required a transitional evaluation for impairment of goodwill balances upon adoption of the new accounting pronouncement 
we completed our transitional review for potential impairment of goodwill that existed at january   and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date 
sfas no 
also requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill in december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of december  a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows  a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  and any significant change in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets are among many factors that could result in an impairment charge that could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
amortization of intangibles decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the adoption of sfas no 
in january and the resulting elimination of goodwill amortization 
amortization of intangibles increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in intangible assets related to the acquisition of litmus in december other income other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a gain of million recognized in related to recovery of business interruption insurance proceeds on a freezer malfunction in may the million gain is net of million of insurance proceeds  offset by a million loss for damaged inventory and million of expenses for certain business remedies 
other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the gain of million related to recovery of business interruption insurance proceeds on a freezer malfunction in may as discussed above  along with a million gain on the disposal of assets during the year 
the amounts in primarily related to interest income generated on our average cash balances 
interest and other expense interest and other expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in our average borrowings outstanding under our line of credit during interest and other expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in our average revolving line of credit balance in related to the acquisition of litmus in which was partially offset by a lower average interest rate in income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates differed from the applicable statutory rates due primarily to the foreign operations for both periods and goodwill amortization during no income tax provision or benefit was recorded during the year ended december  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we changed our accounting policies to implement the effects of sab which resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million during fiscal year we implemented sab in the fourth quarter of by restating our first three quarters of see accompanying consolidating financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have historically been cash flow from operations and borrowings under our line of credit 
our principal requirements for cash currently are for the funding of operations and capital expenditures 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million compared to million at december  the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was million  the components of which are discussed below 
the cash generated from operating activities of million is largely comprised of our net earnings of million  non cash expenses of million related to depreciation and amortization and decreases in our deferred tax asset of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million 
another source of cash during the period was million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock option plans 
our primary uses of cash for the year ended december  were acquisitions of manufacturing equipment and assets related to information technology of million  as well as payments on our line of credit and obligations under capital leases totaling million 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was million  the components of which are discussed below 
the cash generated from operating activities of million is principally our net earnings of million  non cash expenses of million related to depreciation and amortization and decreases in our deferred tax asset of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million 
additionally  we received cash during the period of million for proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock option plans 
our primary uses of cash for the year ended december  were acquisitions of manufacturing equipment  facilities improvements and assets related to information technology of million  as well as a net reduction on our line of credit and obligations under capital leases totaling million 
we have a million term loan facility which matures in july and which bears interest at a rate equal to the lender s base rate minus one quarter of one percent 
we also have a million line of credit facility which matures in july and  at our option  bears interest at a rate equal to the lender s base rate minus one quarter of one percent or at the london interbank offering rate plus two and one quarter percent 
the agreement governing our line of credit and term loan facilities contains certain customary covenants restricting our ability to  among other matters  incur additional indebtedness  create liens or other encumbrances  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  make investments  loans and guarantees or sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets to  or merge or consolidate with  another entity 
as of december  there were no borrowings outstanding under either the line of credit or the term loan 
as of december   we had million of availability both under the line of credit and term loan  and we were in compliance with all covenants 
we plan approximately million in capital expenditures during the primary purpose for our capital expenditures is manufacturing equipment and information technology 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
we have no material commitments with respect to such planned expenditures as of the date of this filing 
we also intend to continue evaluation of acquisition and technology licensing candidates 
as such  we may need to incur additional debt  or sell additional equity  to successfully complete these acquisitions 
cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  such as the extent to which we generate cash from operations  progress in research and development projects  competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products 
based on the current cash position and the current assessment of future operating results  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet operating needs during the next twelve months 
at december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
while we have maintained customer incentive programs during  if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to further increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we record revenues from product sales  net of related rebates and discounts which are estimated at the time the sale is recognized 
revenue from product sales are recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
title to the product and recognition of revenue passes upon delivery to the customer when sales terms are fob destination and at the time of shipment when the sales terms are fob shipping point 
we also earn income for performing services under joint development agreements and licensing of technology 
milestone payments are considered to be payments received for the accomplishment of a discrete  substantive earnings event 
the non refundable payment arising from the achievement of a defined milestone is recognized as revenue when the performance criteria for that milestone have been met since substantive effort is required to achieve the milestone  the amount of the milestone payments appears reasonable  commensurate with the effort expended and collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
income from the grant of license rights is recorded when the event triggering payment to us has occurred as specified by the terms of the related license agreements and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we reclassified the net book value of our assembled workforce intangible  which totaled million  to goodwill 
amortization expense for goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible for the years ended december  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the elimination of amortization relating to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles had a positive impact on net earnings for the year ended december  of approximately million 
sfas no 
requires a transitional evaluation for impairment of goodwill balances upon adoption of the new accounting pronouncement 
we completed our transitional review for potential impairment of goodwill that existed at january   and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date 
sfas no 
also requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill in december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of december  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination were made 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
is an amendment to sfas no 
providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also provides additional disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
amendments are effective for our financial statements ended december  we have currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
if we should choose to adopt such a method  its implementation pursuant to sfas no 
could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  this statement nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement generally requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  other than those associated with a business combination  be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of recognizing the liability at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan as was required in issue the adoption of this statement is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  effective for fiscal years beginning or transactions occurring after may  this statement clarifies several accounting issues including the classification of gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt and lease modifications that should be accounted for in a manner similar to a sales leaseback transaction 
we have adopted this statement  and the adoption had no impact on periods presented in the financial statements included herein 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement addresses the diverse accounting practices for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the adoption of this statement is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the risk of future currency exchange rate fluctuations  which is accounted for as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in operations and have historically not been material 
nonetheless  changes from reporting period to reporting period in the exchange rates between various foreign currencies and the us dollar have had and will continue to have an impact on the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity reported by us  and such effect may be material in any individual reporting period 
the fair market value of floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december  and  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates
