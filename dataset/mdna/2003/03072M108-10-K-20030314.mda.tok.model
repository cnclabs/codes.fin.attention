item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
protection products segment products our protection products segment consists of individual fixed life insurance premiums from traditional life insurance products  universal life insurance products and equity indexed life insurance products as set forth in the following table sales activity by product for the years ended december  in thousands traditional life insurance whole life interest sensitive whole life term life universal life equity indexed life direct first year annualized premiums private label term life premiums total traditional life insurance products 
traditional life insurance products include whole life  interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance products 
whole life insurance is designed to provide benefits for the life of the insured 
this product generally provides for level premiums and a level death benefit and requires payments in excess of the mortality cost in earlier years to offset increasing mortality costs in later years 
sales of whole life insurance decreased in and  as compared to each prior year  due in part to our increased marketing focus on equity indexed life products which has resulted in a shift in sales from whole life to equity indexed 
in addition  there has been an overall general industry decline in sales of whole life products 
we ceased taking new applications for sales of whole life insurance on december  interest sensitive whole life insurance also provides benefits for the life of the insured 
however  this product has flexible premium and benefit patterns not available with traditional whole life plans 
cash value accumulation is interest sensitive and responds to current interest and mortality rates 
sales of interest sensitive whole life insurance are all attributable to ilico 
term life insurance provides life insurance protection for a specific time period which generally can be renewed at an increased premium 
such policies are mortality based and offer no cash accumulation feature 
term life insurance is a highly competitive and quickly changing market 
term life insurance sales increased in and  as compared to each prior year  due to the acquisition of ilico 
we also distribute term products of ilico through strategic alliances with private label partners 
under private label arrangements  ilico designs and issues products that are distributed through other life insurance companies  our private label partners 
ilico reinsures a portion of the risks on those products which we refer to as our private label sales 
we have three private label partners that are actively writing new business 
during the second quarter of  we ceased recruiting new private label partners 
for the year ended december   sales of whole life  interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance products represented  and  respectively  of direct first year annualized premiums for individual life insurance products sold 
universal life insurance products 
we offer universal life insurance products  which provide flexible benefits for the insured 
within product limits and state regulations  policyowners may vary the amount and timing of premiums and the amount of the death benefit of their policies and keep the policies in force  as long as there are sufficient policy funds available to cover all policy charges for the next coverage period 
premiums  net of specified expenses  are credited to the policy  as is interest  generally at a rate determined from time to time by us 
specific charges are made against the policy for the cost of insurance and for expenses 
we invest the premiums we receive from the sale of universal life insurance products in our investment portfolio 
our gross margin from these products is the yield we earn on our investment portfolio plus the internal product charges less interest credited to policies and less mortality and other expenses 
sales of universal life increased in and primarily as a result of the acquisition of ilico 
excluding ilico  universal life sales decreased million and million in and  respectively  due to the introduction and growth in sales of equity indexed life products in the weighted average crediting rate for universal life insurance liabilities was for the year  for the year and for the year the crediting rate has been lowered as a result of reduced investment yields associated with the declining interest rate environment 
for the year ended december   sales of universal life insurance products represented of direct first year annualized premiums for individual life insurance products sold 
equity indexed life products 
we also offer equity indexed life insurance products which are similar in structure to universal life products but allow the policyowner to elect an interest earnings strategy for a portion of the account value earnings 
earnings are credited based in part on increases in the appropriate indices  primarily the standard poor s composite stock index r s p index  excluding dividends 
the earnings credit is subject to a participation rate and an annual cap 
our gross margin on our equity indexed life products is similar to that of our universal life insurance products 
however  due to the equity indexed earnings strategies  we invest a portion of the premiums we receive from the sale of these products in call options 
we may affect the cost of the call options by adjusting interest crediting parameters that are provided for in the policy 
our return on the call options is generally expected  in a growing equity market  to correspond to the earnings we are contractually bound to credit on the equity indexed strategies 
the remainder of the premium is invested in our investment portfolio to support the contractual minimum guarantees that may come into effect if the equity index declines 
the structure of our product  together with the allocation of our equity indexed life product premiums between call options and our investment portfolio  are intended to provide for a positive gross margin in both increasing and decreasing equity markets 
equity indexed life insurance sales increased in and following our focus on product marketing beginning in we are a leading writer of equity indexed life products in the united states 
sales of the equity indexed life product as a percentage of direct first year individual life insurance annualized premiums was approximately in the following table sets forth our collected life insurance premiums  including collected premiums associated with the closed block  for the periods indicated collected premiums by product for the years ended december  in thousands individual life premiums collected traditional life first year and single renewal total universal life first year and single renewal total equity indexed life first year and single renewal total total individual life reinsurance assumed reinsurance ceded total individual life  net of reinsurance individual life insurance premiums collected increased in and due to the additional premiums from the acquisition of ilico and increased equity indexed life sales 
reinsurance assumed increased in and the entire amount of the increase is from the ilico acquisition 
ilico private labels various term life products and previously private labeled second to die products which are no longer being sold but which continue to have renewal premiums 
the products are designed by ilico  issued by ilico s private label partners and then assumed in whole or in part by ilico 
we have three private label partners that are actively writing new business 
during the second quarter of  we ceased recruiting new private label partners 
beginning january   alic entered into a new reinsurance arrangement that reduced its retention to of the net amount of risk on any one policy not to exceed company retention limits for the majority of policies issued since july  and for the majority of new business going forward 
alic s retention limits on any one life vary by age and rating table and are generally between  and  in addition  effective july   alic entered into a reinsurance agreement covering its closed block policies 
under this agreement  alic has reinsured approximately of the closed block net amount at risk not previously reinsured 
alic also entered into an indemnity reinsurance agreement effective december  covering universal life policies of the open block issued prior to july   that was subsequently replaced by another indemnity reinsurance agreement effective october  covering of the net amount at risk not previously reinsured of any one policy 
as a result of these new agreements  ceded reinsurance premium for alic was million in  million in and million in the remainder of the ceded premium was from ilico and amounted to million in and million in ilico s reinsurance agreements effectively reduce ilico s retention limit to between  and  we also entered into new reinsurance agreements effective december   which did not impact collected premiums in but will affect collected premiums beginning january  alic entered into an modified coinsurance quota share and coinsurance agreement covering certain individual life policies of the closed block with a related reinsurance premium of million accrued as of december  also  ilic entered into a reinsurance agreement to cover quota share of retained net amounts at risk for certain open block and closed block policies in force at december   for which a reinsurance premium of million was accrued at december  the following table sets forth information regarding our life insurance in force for each date presented individual life insurance in force as of december  in thousands traditional life number of policies gaap life reserves face amounts universal life number of policies gaap life reserves face amounts equity indexed life number of policies gaap life reserves face amounts total life insurance number of policies gaap life reserves face amounts the acquisition of ilico in increased the number of policies in force by  gaap life reserves by billion and face amounts by billion at december  distribution systems our subsidiaries sell life insurance in all states  the district of columbia and the us virgin islands 
the states with the highest geographic concentration of sales  based on statutory premiums  are california  illinois  iowa  minnesota  new york and texas in these states account for approximately of our statutory premiums 
our target customers are individuals in the middle and upper income brackets and small businesses 
we market our life insurance products on a national basis primarily through a preferred producer agency system  a personal producing general agent ppga distribution system and through independent marketing organizations imos 
we currently employ regional vice presidents who are responsible for supervising these distribution systems within their assigned geographic regions 
under the preferred producer agency system  a contractual arrangement is entered into with the preferred producer general agent for the sale of insurance products by the preferred producer agents and brokers assigned to the preferred producer general agent s agency 
the preferred producer general agents are primarily compensated by receiving a percentage of the first year commissions paid to preferred producer agents and brokers in the preferred producer general agent s agency and by renewal commissions on premiums subsequently collected on that business 
in addition  the preferred producers receive certain fringe benefits and other allowances 
the preferred producer general agents are independent contractors and are generally responsible for the expenses of operating their agencies  including office and overhead expenses and the recruiting  selection  contracting  training and development of preferred producer agents and brokers in their agency 
as of december   we had preferred producer general agents in states  through which approximately  preferred producer agents sell our products 
while preferred producer agents in the preferred producer agency system are non exclusive  most agents use our products for a majority of their new business for the type of products offered by us 
no single preferred producer general agency accounts for more than of the total first year life commissions paid by us 
preferred producer agents are also independent contractors and are primarily compensated by commissions on first year and renewal premiums collected on business written by them plus certain fringe benefits and other allowances 
in addition  preferred producer agents can earn bonus commissions  graded by production and persistency on their business 
under the ppga system  we contract primarily with individuals who are experienced individual agents or head a small group of experienced individual agents 
these individuals are independent contractors and are responsible for all of their own expenses 
these individuals often sell products for other insurance companies  and may offer selected products we offer rather than our full line of insurance products 
the ppga system is comprised of approximately  ppgas  with approximately  agents 
ppgas are compensated by commissions on first year and renewal premiums collected on business written by themselves and the agents in their units 
in addition to a base commission  ppgas may earn bonus commissions on their business  graded by production and persistency 
we have also developed programs to sell life insurance through select imos 
the customers targeted and the products sold are similar to those of the preferred producer agency system and the ppga system 
under the imo system  a contractual arrangement is entered into with an imo to promote our insurance products to their network of agents and brokers 
the imo receives a commission and override commission on the business produced 
we currently have approximately imos under contract 
we also distribute term products of ilico through strategic alliances with private label partners 
under private label arrangements  ilico designs and manufactures products that are distributed through the field forces of other life insurance companies  our private label partners 
we currently have three private label partners actively writing new business 
accumulation products segment products our accumulation products segment offerings consist of individual deferred fixed annuities comprised of traditional deferred fixed annuities and equity indexed fixed annuities  variable annuities and funding agreements 
annuities provide for the payment of periodic benefits over a specified time period 
benefits may commence immediately or may be deferred to a future date 
fixed annuities generally are backed by a general investment account and credited with a rate of return that is periodically reset 
variable annuities provide for the policyholder to direct all or a portion of his or her account balance into an investment that effectively passes the market risks and rewards of holding that investment to the policyholders 
funding agreements are arrangements for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
our annuity deposits consisted of approximately from deferred fixed annuity products  approximately from equity indexed annuity products and approximately from variable annuity products in funding agreement deposits totaled million in the following table sets forth deposits for the periods indicated deposits by product for the years ended december  in thousands annuities fixed annuities deferred fixed annuities equity indexed annuities variable annuities total annuities funding agreements total reinsurance assumed reinsurance ceded total deposits  net of reinsurance deferred fixed annuity products 
we offer a variety of interest rate crediting strategies on our traditional deferred fixed annuity products 
these strategies include initial interest crediting rates with guarantees for periods of one to five years 
following the initial guarantee period  we may adjust the credited interest rate annually  subject to the minimum interest rates specified in the contracts 
such minimum guarantee rates currently range from to 
we also offer an interest rate crediting strategy that credits the policy with a return generally based upon the interest rates it earns on assets supporting the respective policies less management fees 
we invest the deposits we receive from deferred fixed annuity product sales in our investment portfolio 
we call the difference between the yield we earn on our investment portfolio and the interest we credit on our deferred fixed annuities our investment spread 
the investment spread is a major driver of the profitability of our deferred fixed annuity products 
deferred fixed annuity deposits decreased million in compared to as a result of deploying capital to funding agreements which are intended to provide a higher return on equity 
in  deferred fixed annuity deposits increased million compared to which was primarily attributable to product repricing  increased marketing efforts and the acquisition of ilico 
effective october   we entered into a reinsurance agreement to cede of certain fixed annuity production on a modified coinsurance basis 
fixed annuity production ceded under this agreement totaled approximately million in and million in in the fourth quarter of  the agreement was cancelled and the previously ceded premiums were recaptured amounting to million 
ilico reinsures approximately of its fixed annuities on a modified coinsurance basis which increased reinsurance ceded by approximately million in and million in equity indexed annuities 
we offer equity indexed annuity products that provide various interest crediting strategies  including strategies linked to equity and investment grade bond indices 
for deposits allocated to indexed crediting strategies  interest is credited to these products based in part on the increases in the applicable indices  less any applicable fees and subject to any applicable caps 
similar to our deferred fixed annuity products  we invest the deposits we receive from equity indexed annuity product sales in our investment portfolio 
in addition  for deposits allocated to equity indexed crediting strategies  we use a portion of the deposits to purchase call options 
we may affect the cost of the call options by adjusting interest crediting parameters that are provided for in the policy 
our return on the call options is generally expected  in a growing equity market  to correspond to the earnings we are contractually bound to credit on the equity indexed strategies 
the remainder of the deposit is invested in our investment portfolio to support the contractual minimum guarantees that may come into effect if the equity index declines 
the gross spread on deposits allocated to our equity indexed strategy is the yield we earn on our investment portfolio  less the cost of the call options  less any interest credited to policyholders due to minimum guarantees in effect 
the gross spread  similar to the investment spread on deferred fixed annuity products  is a major driver of profitability of our equity indexed annuity products 
the structure of our product  together with the allocation of our equity indexed strategy deposits between call options and our investment portfolio  are intended to provide for a positive gross spread in both increasing and decreasing equity markets 
equity indexed annuity sales increased in and as compared to the prior year periods due to its popularity with consumers and agents following the introduction of new products in in the third quarter of  we entered into a new modified coinsurance reinsurance agreement to cede of certain equity indexed annuity products which amounted to million of ceded premium in variable annuities 
through our acquisition of ilico  we obtained a variable annuity product line 
in the first quarter of  we ceased new sales of these products  except for new policies issued as part of existing employer sponsored qualified plan contracts 
all sales were discontinued effective september  our agents are encouraged to make new sales of variable annuities through the ameritas joint venture 
as these sales are through the joint venture  they do not appear in our direct sales amounts 
see ameritas joint venture below 
the assets and liabilities related to the direct variable annuities are shown on the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and separate account liabilities 
funding agreements 
we placed primarily fixed rate funding agreements totaling million in funding agreements are arrangements for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
total funding agreements as of december   amounted to billion compared to million at december  the following table sets forth information regarding fixed annuities in force for each date presented annuities in force as of december  in thousands deferred fixed and immediate annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves equity indexed annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves total fixed annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves the acquisition of ilico in increased the total number of annuity policies by  and gaap annuity reserves by billion at december  distribution systems we sell annuities in all states  the district of columbia and the us virgin islands 
the states with the highest geographic concentration of sales  based on statutory premiums  are arizona  california  florida  iowa  ohio  pennsylvania and texas in these states account for approximately of our statutory premiums 
we direct our marketing efforts towards the asset accumulation  conservative savings and retirement markets 
we market our annuity products on a national basis primarily through networks of independent agents 
the independent agents are supervised by regional vice presidents and regional directors or imos 
at december   we had approximately  independent agents licensed to sell our annuity products 
in addition  the preferred producer agency and ppga systems discussed previously are utilized to market certain annuity products 
our imos consist of approximately contracted organizations and five wholly owned organizations 
the imos are responsible for recruiting  servicing and educating agents in an effort to promote our products 
the imos receive an override commission based on the business produced by their agents 
our wholly owned organizations accounted for approximately of our annuity sales in no single agent accounted for more than of total annuity sales in we do not have exclusive agency agreements with our agents and we believe most of these agents sell products similar to ours for other insurance companies 
we also sell annuities through a bank distribution system 
the customers targeted and the products sold are similar to those sold by the independent agent networks 
we own an independent marketing organization that is associated with over community banks in the southeast region of the united states 
fixed annuity products are the primary product focus of this organization 
under the bank distribution system  we contract with banks and marketing organizations for the sale of annuities by agents who are employees of the banks 
commissions are paid to the banks 
at december   we had approximately banks and marketing organizations under contract through which approximately agents sell our products 
we provide training and servicing support to the banks and marketing organizations 
ameritas joint venture we participate in a joint venture  the ameritas joint venture  with ameritas life insurance corp 
or ameritas through alic s ownership interest in amal corporation  a nebraska corporation 
amal corporation s operations are conducted through ameritas variable life insurance company  or avlic  ameritas investment corp 
or aic  and the advisors group  inc or tag  its three wholly owned subsidiaries 
avlic is licensed to conduct business in states and the district of columbia 
aic and tag are registered broker dealers 
our partner in the ameritas joint venture  ameritas  is a nebraska mutual life insurance company which has been in existence for more than years 
our investment in the ameritas joint venture provides access to a line of existing variable life insurance and annuity products while providing a lower cost entry into an established business  helping to eliminate significant start up costs and allowing for immediate potential earnings 
the ameritas joint venture offers through avlic fixed annuity products  flexible premium and single premium variable universal life insurance products and variable annuities 
variable products provide for allocation of funds to a general account or to one or more separate accounts under which the owner bears the investment risk 
through avlic s fund managers  owners of variable annuities and life insurance policies are able to choose from a range of investment funds offered by each manager 
under the current terms of the joint venture agreement  alic and ameritas direct their new variable annuities and variable life insurance through the ameritas joint venture 
the variable life insurance products and the fixed and variable annuities offered by the ameritas joint venture are distributed through our preferred producer general agency  ppga and bank distribution systems  as well as through the distribution systems of ameritas and avlic 
under the current terms of the joint venture agreement  we purchased an additional of amal corporation in march  for million as certain premium growth targets were met which brought our total ownership in amal corporation to 
during  ameritas contributed additional investments  certain in force business and other assets to the ameritas joint venture which resulted in the reduction of our ownership from to 
in addition  in december  both ameritas and alic contributed additional cash which amounted to million by alic to maintain our interest

as of december   amal corporation had total consolidated assets of  million and total consolidated shareholder s equity of million on a gaap basis 
avlic had  million of insurance in force and million in surplus as of december   on a statutory basis 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete with numerous life insurance companies and other entities including banks and other financial institutions  many of which have greater financial and other resources 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the sale of insurance products are product features  price  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  financial strength ratings  value added service and name recognition 
many other companies are capable of competing for sales in our target markets including companies that do not presently compete in such markets 
our ability to compete for sales is dependent upon our ability to successfully address the competitive factors 
in addition to competing for sales  we compete for qualified agents and brokers to distribute products 
strong competition exists among insurance companies for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability 
we believe that the bases of competition for the services of such agents and brokers are commission structure  support services  prior relationships and the strength of an insurer s products 
although we believe that we have good relationships with our agents and brokers  our ability to compete will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified persons 
ratings ratings with respect to financial strength are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
the following are the ratings as of march  for our major insurance subsidiaries currently writing new business company rating service rating type rating american standard poor s insurer financial strength a strong american a

il annuity has a standard poor s rating of bb marginal and an am best rating of a excellent 
on september   moody s investor services changed the rating outlook for all of our insurance subsidiaries to negative from stable 
the change occurred as part of moody s assessment of its current life insurers ratings given the current operating environment 
a negative outlook indicates that if certain trends continue or worsen  moody s believes the insurance subsidiaries ratings may have to be adjusted downward 
insurance underwriting we follow detailed  uniform underwriting practices and procedures in our insurance business which are designed to assess risks before issuing coverage to qualified applicants 
we have professional underwriters who evaluate policy applications on the basis of information provided by applicants and others 
reinsurance in accordance with industry practices  we reinsure portions of our life insurance exposure with unaffiliated insurance companies under traditional indemnity reinsurance arrangements 
such reinsurance arrangements are in accordance with standard reinsurance practices within the industry 
we enter into these arrangements to assist in diversifying risks and to limit the maximum loss on risks that exceed policy retention limits 
indemnity reinsurance does not fully discharge our obligation to pay claims on business we reinsure 
as the ceding company  we remain responsible for policy claims to the extent the reinsurer fails to pay such claims 
we annually monitor the creditworthiness of our primary reinsurers  and have experienced no material reinsurance recoverability problems in recent years 
for accounting purposes  premiums and expenses in the income statement are reported net of reinsurance ceded 
policy reserves  policyowner funds and other related assets and liabilities are not reduced for reinsurance ceded in the balance sheet  rather a reinsurance receivable is established for such balance sheet items 
due to the ilico acquisition  reinsurance receivables increased as shown on our balance sheet to million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  we reinsure mortality risk on individual life insurance policies 
our retention is generally between  and  on any single life depending on the type of policy reinsured 
we also reinsure certain annuity business primarily on a modified coinsurance basis 
at december  and  we ceded life insurance with a face amount of billion with unaffiliated reinsurers and life insurance with a face amount of billion with unaffiliated reinsurers  respectively 
the following is a summary of our principal life reinsurers as of december  of total face am best face amount reinsurer amount ceded rating reinsured in billions rga reinsurance company a reassure america life insurance company a a employers reassurance corporation a swiss re life health america inc a a lincoln national life insurance company a a transamerica occidental life insurance company a a affiliated companies at december  and  we ceded fixed and equity indexed annuities having reserves of billion and billion  respectively 
the following is a summary of our principal annuity reinsurers as of december  of total am best face amount reinsurer reserves ceded rating reinsured in billions transamerica occidental life insurance company a rga reinsurance company a employees as of december   we had  full time employees 
none of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
government regulation we are subject to regulation by the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and or transact business 
state insurance laws generally establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers related to granting and revoking licenses  transacting business  regulating the payment of dividends to stockholders  establishing guaranty fund associations  licensing agents  approving policy forms  regulating sales practices  regulating premium rates for some lines of business  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted 
every state in which our insurance companies are licensed administers a guaranty fund  which provides for assessments of licensed insurers for the protection of policyowners of insolvent insurance companies 
assessments can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states 
risk based capital  or rbc  standards for life insurance companies were adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners  known as the naic and require insurance companies to calculate and report for statutory basis financial statements information under a risk based capital formula 
the rbc requirements are intended to allow insurance regulators to identify at an early stage inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in such companies operations 
the formula includes components for asset risk  liability risk  interest rate exposure and other factors 
as of december   each of our life insurance companies rbc levels were in excess of authorized control level rbc thresholds established by insurance regulators 
although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives and changes in federal law can often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
current and proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements  changes to the tax advantages of life insurance and annuity products or the programs with which they are used 
such changes may affect the level of sales and the financial impact of the policies on policyowners and the company 
the effect of these changes cannot currently be evaluated but they could potentially be adverse 
new savings and dividend proposals and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business could also have an adverse impact on the company

item legal proceedings in recent years  the life insurance industry  including the company and its subsidiaries  have been subject to an increase in litigation pursued on behalf of purported classes of insurance purchasers  questioning the conduct of insurers in the marketing of their products 
the company is involved in litigation  including class actions  reinsurance claims and regulatory proceedings  arising in the ordinary course of its business 
some of these claims and legal actions are in jurisdictions where juries are given substantial latitude in assessing damages  including punitive damages 
although no assurances can be given and no determinations can be made at this time  the company believes that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these claims and legal actions  would have no material effect on its results of operations and financial position 
as previously disclosed  one of the company s subsidiaries  il annuity  has had a dispute with the reinsurer of a block of its annuity business 
in december of  the reinsurer began arbitration proceedings against il annuity claiming approximately million and other appropriate relief related to investment charges in connection with a reinsurance agreement between the reinsurer and il annuity 
the arbitration process is in its preliminary stages 
although predicting the outcome is not feasible  the company believes it has strong defenses against the claims  and based upon currently available information  that any liability arising from these claims would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of amerus group co 
should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes 
nature of operations we are a holding company whose subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the business of marketing  underwriting and distributing a broad range of individual life  annuity and insurance deposit products to individuals and businesses in states  the district of columbia and the us virgin islands 
we have two reportable operating segments protection products and accumulation products 
the protection products segment was formerly known as the life insurance segment and the accumulation products segment was formerly known as the annuity segment 
the primary offerings of the protection products segment are interest sensitive whole life  term life  universal life and equity indexed life insurance policies 
the primary offerings of the accumulation products segment are individual fixed annuities and funding agreements 
we acquired ilico which had assets of approximately billion on may  its operations have been included with ours since that date 
financial highlights our financial highlights are as follows for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share data adjusted pre tax operating income a protection products accumulation products other operations total adjusted pre tax operating income adjusted net operating income a net income diluted earnings per share adjusted net operating income a net income total assets stockholders equity without aoci a adjusted operating income does not constitute net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
see adjusted net operating income section for additional information 
adjusted pre tax operating income in both of our operating segments increased in and as compared to each of the prior years 
growth in our protection products adjusted pre tax operating income in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ilico combined with a slight growth in product margins and a decline in operating expenses 
the increase in the protection products adjusted pre tax operating income in was primarily due to the acquisition of ilico together with decreased insurance expenses and level gross margins 
our accumulation products pre tax operating income also increased in and due to the acquisition of ilico 
in addition  increased independent marketing organizations imos operating income and the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in also contributed to the growth in accumulation products earnings 
adjusted pre tax operating income from other operations primarily consists of holding company revenues and expenses and operations of our real estate management subsidiary 
adjusted pre tax operating income from other operations has declined each year as compared to the prior year as we reduce our investments in real estate management 
in addition  we had more revenues at our holding company in from cash equivalents we were holding to fund the demutualization payments to our former members in october of net income increased in compared to primarily as a result of the growth in our protection products and accumulation products segments 
in addition  net income was reduced for amounts applicable to minority interest shareholders through september  when we acquired such interest 
partially offsetting these additions to net income were increased realized losses on investments and increased net unrealized losses from sfas related market value adjustments on trading securities  derivatives and certain annuity contracts 
net income decreased in compared to primarily as a result of realized losses on investments  unrealized losses from sfas and increased restructuring charges 
the reductions in net income were partially offset by the growth in our protection and accumulation products segments 
see the adjusted net operating income section for a further discussion of the items included in net income but excluded from operating income 
total assets increased billion during primarily as a result of the placement of funding agreements totaling million  growth in annuity sales  net of surrenders  and increased investment market values 
total assets increased billion during primarily due to the acquisition of ilico 
stockholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  declined million in as a result of treasury stock purchases of million and dividends of million 
the stock repurchases and dividends were partially offset by an increase in equity for net income of million 
stockholders equity  excluding aoci  increased million in  primarily due to the issuance of million worth of stock in connection with the acquisition of ilico  the issuance of million of stock in connection with the conversion of capital securities  and net income 
treasury stock purchases in were million 
adjusted net operating income the following table reflects net income adjusted to eliminate certain items which management believes do not necessarily indicate overall operating trends 
adjusted net operating income is the basis we use to assess our overall performance 
adjusted net operating income as described by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies  including insurance companies 
the adjusted net operating income shown below does not constitute net income computed in accordance with gaap 
the adjustments are presented net of income taxes 
in addition  the adjustments for and prior years are also presented after minority interest

non core realized gains or losses may vary widely between periods 
such amounts are determined by management s timing of individual transactions or current market conditions and do not necessarily correspond to the underlying operating trends 
b represents amortization of dac and value of business acquired voba on the non core realized gains or losses that are included in our product margins 
c represents the net effect of statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  related accounting entries 
the accounting entries consist of cash flow hedge amortization  market value adjustments on trading securities  derivatives  certain annuity contracts  and the associated change in amortization of dac and voba resulting from such adjustments 
d represents costs directly related to our demutualizations 
the costs consist primarily of legal  actuarial and consulting expenses 
e represents costs of restructuring our operations to eliminate duplicative functions 
the costs consist primarily of relocation of employees  severance and termination benefits  and system conversions 
f represents the net income from our residential financing and property operations which is not part of our insurance operations 
g represents the cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives  as of january   resulting from our adoption of sfas h our predecessor  amhc  was originally formed in as a mutual holding company and  therefore  had no shares of common stock outstanding until the demutualization of our group on september  on september   we distributed million shares of our common stock to our former members and exchanged our common stock for the million shares of common stock held by the public in alhi  our former subsidiary and another of our predecessor entities  on a one for one basis 
our operating income primarily reflects the operating income of alhi 
therefore  adjusted net operating income per share was calculated based on the number of shares of stock we owned of alhi through september  since then  adjusted net operating income per share has been calculated based on the shares of our common shares actually outstanding 
the increase in adjusted net operating income in compared to was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ilico which operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since may  and the growth in our protection products and accumulation products segments as explained in the next two sections 
the increase in adjusted net operating income in compared to was primarily due to the acquisition of ilico and the reduction in income applicable to the minority interests 
segment income we use the same accounting policies and procedures to measure operating segment income as we use to measure consolidated income from operations with the exception of the elimination of certain items which management believes are not necessarily indicative of overall operating trends 
these items are shown between adjusted pre tax operating income and income from continuing operations on the following operating segment tables and are as follows realized gains and losses on non core investments 
market value changes and amortization of assets and liabilities associated with the application of sfas  such as unrealized gains and losses on securities held for trading 
change in option value of equity indexed products and market value adjustments on total return strategy annuities 
cash flow hedge amortization 
amortization of dac and voba related to the realized gains and losses on the non core investments and the sfas adjustments 
demutualization costs 
restructuring costs 
other income from non insurance operations 
these items will fluctuate from period to period depending on the prevailing interest rate and economic environment  are not continuing in nature  or are not part of the core insurance operations 
as a result  management believes they do not reflect the ongoing earnings capacity of our operating segments 
protection products our protection products segment consists of whole life  interest sensitive whole life  term life  universal life and equity indexed life insurance policies 
these products are marketed on a national basis primarily through a preferred producer agency system  ppga distribution system and imos 
included in protection products is the closed block of alic and the closed block of ilic established when the companies reorganized from mutual forms to stock forms of ownership 
when protection products are sold  we invest the premiums we receive in our investment portfolio and establish a liability representing our commitment to the policyholder 
we manage investment spread by seeking to maximize the return on these invested assets  consistent with our asset liability and credit quality needs 
protection products in force totaled billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  a summary of our protection products segment operations follows for the years ended december  in thousands revenues insurance premiums universal life product charges net investment income core realized gains losses on investments other income total revenues benefits and expenses policyowner benefits underwriting  acquisition and other expenses amortization of dac and voba  net of non core gain loss adjustment dividends to policyowners total benefits and expenses adjusted pre tax operating income protection products segment adjusted pre tax operating income from our protection products increased in and in compared to the respective prior years 
the increase in was due to a slight growth in product margins  a decline in operating expenses and the acquisition of ilico 
the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of ilico together with decreased insurance expenses and level gross margins 
the key drivers of our protection products business include sales  persistency  net investment income  mortality and expenses 
sales  premiums and product charges 
annualized premium for new products issued represents sales for protection products 
as illustrated in the sales activity product table presented in item business protection products segment  direct first year annualized premiums increased in compared to and in compared to the increases were primarily due to the acquisition of ilico during the second quarter of excluding the sales from ilico  life insurance sales increased in and in we experienced growth in almost all our protection product lines with significant increases coming from our interest sensitive whole life and equity indexed life products 
interest sensitive whole life insurance has flexible premium and benefit patterns and its cash value accumulation changes with current interest and mortality rates 
the equity indexed life product allows the policyowner to elect an earnings strategy for a portion of the account value whereby earnings are credited based primarily on increases in the s p index  excluding dividends 
the earnings credit is subject to a participation rate and an annual cap 
sales of interest sensitive whole life and equity indexed life products were million in as compared to million in and million in we are a leading writer of equity indexed life products in the united states 
we also distribute term products of ilico through strategic alliances with private label partners 
under private label arrangements  ilico designs and issues products that are distributed through other life insurance companies  our private label partners 
ilico reinsures a portion of the risks on those products which we refer to as our private label sales 
we have three private label partners that are actively writing new business 
during the second quarter of  we ceased recruiting new private label partners 
we recognize premiums on traditional life insurance policies as revenues when the premiums are due 
amounts received as payments for universal life and equity indexed life insurance policies are not recorded as premium revenue  but are instead recorded as a policyholder liability 
revenues from the universal life and equity indexed life policies consist of product charges for the cost of insurance  policy administration and policy surrender 
all revenue is reported net of reinsurance ceded 
insurance premium revenue and product charge revenue increased in and as compared to the respective prior years primarily due to the acquisition of ilico 
persistency 
annualized lapse rates were as follows for the years ended december  lapse rate including ilico excluding ilico our persistency experience remained within our pricing assumptions 
our lapse rate  including ilico  for as compared to and increased as expected due to the completion of ilico s demutualization payout in july lapses tend to decline in anticipation of a demutualization transaction as policyholders want to remain policyholders so they will be eligible for the demutualization payout 
following a demutualization  lapses tend to increase for a period before they return to a more normal level 
our lapse rate  excluding ilico  decreased in compared to and increased in compared to alic experienced higher lapse rates in following the completion of a demutualization in the third quarter of net investment income 
net investment income increased in and compared to the respective prior years 
the increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of ilico partially offset by lower effective yields 
the effective yield of the investment portfolio was in compared to in and in the decrease in yields in and was primarily a result of the lower interest rate market 
mortality and benefit expense 
for and  we experienced favorable mortality but  due to the acquisition of ilico  total benefit expense is higher than in the respective prior years 
total policyowner benefits for ilico were million for the full year of and million for the portion of the year after its acquisition in may in addition  we had increased reinsurance recoveries in and  which decrease benefit expense  as a result of the additional reinsurance arrangements entered into in  and underwriting  acquisition and other expenses 
expenses increased in and compared to the respective prior years  primarily due to the acquisition of ilico 
the addition of expenses associated with ilico of million and million for and  respectively  were partially offset by increased reimbursement from reinsurers for commission and expense allowances 
commission and expense allowances increased as more policies were subject to reinsurance 
in addition  expenses decreased due to expense structure changes resulting from the integration with ilico 
outlook 
we expect to continue to increase sales through our multiple distribution channels and to continue to shift to higher return products  in particular the equity indexed life products 
we also expect to continue to realize operating efficiencies created by the restructuring and centralization of our administrative functions as discussed later in non recurring expenses 
accumulation products our accumulation products segment primary offerings consist of individual fixed annuities and funding agreements 
the fixed annuities are marketed on a national basis primarily through imos and independent brokers 
similar to our protection products segment  we invest the deposits we receive from accumulation product sales in our investment portfolio and establish a liability representing our commitment to our policyholder 
we manage investment spread by seeking to maximize the return on our invested assets consistent with our asset liability management and credit quality needs 
when appropriate  we periodically reset the interest rates credited to our policyholder liability 
accumulation products in force totaled billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  a summary of our accumulation products segment operations follows for the years ended december  in thousands revenues immediate annuity and supplementary contract premiums annuity product charges net investment income core realized unrealized gains losses on investments other income total revenues benefits and expenses policyowner benefits underwriting  acquisition and other expenses amortization of dac and voba  net of non core gain loss adjustment total benefits and expenses imo operations other income other expenses net imo operating income adjusted pre tax operating income accumulation products segment adjusted pre tax operating income from our accumulation products operations increased in and in compared to the respective prior years 
the increases in and were primarily due to the acquisition of ilico in and increased imo operating income 
in addition  the increase in was also due to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization 
the drivers of profitability in our accumulation products business are sales  persistency  investment spread  expenses and imo operations 
sales and product charges 
deposits we receive for annuities and funding agreements represent sales for accumulation products 
as illustrated in the deposits by product table presented in item business accumulation products segments  direct accumulation product sales increased in compared to and in as compared to total annuity sales decreased in compared to and increased in compared to the decrease resulted from the deployment of capital to funding agreements which should provide a higher return on equity 
the increase in annuity sales was primarily due to product repricing  increased marketing efforts and the acquisition of ilico 
we placed primarily fixed rate funding agreements totaling million in funding agreements are arrangements for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
total funding agreements as of december  amounted to billion compared to million at december  and the deposits we receive on accumulation products are not recorded as revenue but instead as a policyholder liability 
surrender charges are recorded as revenue as an annuity product charge 
annuity product charges increased in and as compared to each prior year due to the growth in business and the acquisition of ilico 
persistency 
withdrawals represent funds taken out of accumulation products by policyowners not including those due to the death of policyowners 
annuity withdrawal rates both with and without internal replacements continued to improve in as compared to and annuity withdrawals and annualized annuity withdrawal rates were as follows for the years ended december  annuity withdrawal rates withdrawals including internal replacements including ilico excluding ilico withdrawals excluding internal replacements including ilico excluding ilico annuity withdrawals in millions including ilico excluding ilico our withdrawal experience remained within our pricing assumptions 
withdrawal rates declined in and as compared to the respective prior years as our annuity products provide a favorable investment return in this current low interest rate and declining equity market environment 
investment spread 
investment results and interest crediting rates were as follows for deferred fixed annuities for the years ended december  investment yield average crediting rate investment spread the investment spread on deferred fixed annuities increased basis points to basis points in compared to the investment spread decreased basis points to basis points in compared to crediting rates were lowered in the fourth quarter of and throughout to correspond with the decline in investment yields caused by lower rates on new and reinvested funds 
at december   the account value of deferred fixed annuities totaled billion of which billion did not have a differential between the credited rate and minimum guarantee rate and as such could not be lowered 
additionally  deferred fixed annuities with account values totaling billion have multi year interest rate guarantees for which the credited rate cannot be decreased until the end of the multi year period 
at the end of the multi year guarantee period  we will have the ability to lower the crediting rate to the minimum guaranteed rate by an average decrease of approximately basis points 
also  at december   account values of equity indexed annuities totaled billion which provide guaranteed rates based on a cumulative floor over the term of the product 
due to these limitations on the ability to lower interest crediting rates and the potential for additional credit defaults and lower reinvestment rates on investments  we could experience spread compression in future periods 
underwriting  acquisition and other expenses 
expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to goodwill no longer being amortized effective january  with the adoption of sfas goodwill amortization amounted to million in and million in expenses in increased as compared to primarily due to the acquisition of ilico 
imo operations 
we own five imos which are marketing organizations with contractual arrangements to promote our insurance products to their networks of agents and brokers 
additionally  they also contract with third party insurance companies 
the income from imo operations primarily represents annuity commissions received by our imos from those third party insurance companies 
net imo operating income increased million in compared to due to our acquisition of an imo in and increased million in compared to due to an imo acquired in and in mid outlook 
we anticipate increased product sales from our imos but decreased product sales from other distribution as we manage our sales in this current low interest rate environment 
we also expect to continue the shift of our product mix to higher return products  in particular the equity indexed annuity products 
in addition  we will continue to manage our spreads as we strive for our desired profitability in this economic environment 
other the other segment primarily consists of holding company revenues and expenses and operations of our real estate management subsidiary 
the adjusted pre tax operating loss in as compared to the adjusted pre tax operating income in is primarily due to real estate investment and management fee income which continue to decline as we reduce these investment holdings and a decline in investment fee income for asset management services provided to ilico prior to the acquisition amounting to million in and million in after the acquisition of ilico  such fees are eliminated with expenses in consolidation 
also  other segment income declined in compared to from the reduction in holding company cash equivalents of approximately million generated primarily from the sale of discontinued operations in and distributed to our members in connection with our demutualization in october income statement reconciliation a reconciliation of our adjusted pre tax operating income by segment to net income as shown in our consolidated statements of income follows for the years ended december  in thousands adjusted pre tax operating income protection products accumulation products other operations total adjusted pre tax operating income non operating increases decreases to income realized and unrealized losses on assets and liabilities realized losses on non core investments unrealized losses on non core trading investments fair value change in option value of equity indexed annuity products and market value adjustments on total return strategy annuities cash flow hedge amortization amortization of dac voba due to non core realized gains or losses for the years ended december  in thousands non recurring expenses demutualization costs restructuring costs other income from non insurance operations income from continuing operations interest expense income tax expense minority interest net income from continuing operations cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives  net of tax net income realized and unrealized losses on assets and liabilities 
realized losses on non core investments in consisted primarily of realized losses and writedowns on investments related to dynegy holdings  green tree financial  national century  nrg northeast generating  trenwick group  united airlines  us air  and worldcom inc the realized losses in consisted primarily of writedowns on investments mainly related to telecommunications and emerging markets investments 
the level of realized gains and losses will fluctuate from period to period depending on the prevailing interest rate  the economic environment and the timing of investment sales 
unrealized losses on non core investments are generated from our options and trading securities 
we use options to hedge our equity indexed products 
in accordance with sfas  we adjusted our options to market value  which  due to the economic environment and deteriorating stock market conditions  resulted in an unrealized loss of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  we also have trading securities that back our total return strategy fixed annuity products 
the market value adjustment on the trading securities resulted in a loss of million and million in and  respectively 
most of the unrealized gains and losses on the options and trading securities are offset by similar adjustments to the option portion of the equity indexed product reserves and to the total return strategy annuity reserves 
the reserve adjustments are reflected in policyowner benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income and are included in the fair value change of million in and million in explained in the following paragraph 
the fair value change in options embedded within our equity indexed products and the fair value changes on our total return strategy fixed annuity contracts are being recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted january  as previously discussed  these fair value changes are offset by similar adjustments to unrealized gains losses on investments related to the fair value changes on the options that hedge the equity indexed products and on the trading securities that back the total return strategy products 
the reduction in such contract expense is less than the decline in investment income primarily due to the inability to lower crediting rates below minimum guaranteed interest rates 
non recurring expenses 
the demutualization costs consist primarily of legal  actuarial and consulting expenses associated with our demutualization that was completed in the third quarter of the demutualization costs are associated with the demutualization of ilic  which was completed when we acquired ilico in may as a requirement of ilic s demutualization  we undertook a commission free program under which shareholders with less than one hundred shares could redeem those shares for cash or purchase additional shares  commission free  to reach a holding of at least one hundred shares 
the costs are primarily for commissions  postage and printing under this program 
since these costs are not ongoing  they have been excluded from our operating segment amounts 
restructuring costs relate to our consolidation of various functions in connection with a restructuring of our protection products and accumulation products operations and investment activities which began in the third quarter of the objective of the restructuring plan is to eliminate duplicative functions for all business units and to reduce on going operating costs 
corporate administrative functions are being transitioned so they are performed primarily in des moines  iowa 
protection products administration processes were previously planned to be performed in indianapolis  indiana  des moines  or woodbury  new york  however  it has now been determined that these processes will be transitioned so they are performed in des moines  woodbury  or outsourced 
this will result in the elimination of additional positions in indianapolis 
accumulation products functions are being transitioned to topeka 
investment activities have been restructured to eliminate certain real estate management services which have been outsourced 
the restructuring charges expensed in included pre tax severance and termination benefits of million related to the elimination of approximately positions and other pre tax costs of million primarily related to systems conversion and relocation of employees 
the restructuring charges expensed in included pre tax severance and termination benefits of million related to the elimination of approximately positions and other pre tax costs of million 
an accrual for severance and termination benefits not yet paid amounted to million at december  additional charges will be incurred for continuing restructuring activities primarily involving severance or relocation benefits for affected employees  various administrative  financial and actuarial system conversion costs  and building disposition costs 
system conversion costs will be expensed as incurred and are expected to be substantially completed by the fourth quarter of a majority of the severance costs due to the transition in of the protection products processes from indianapolis to des moines  woodbury or to be outsourced were accrued in the fourth quarter of minority interest 
minority interest represents the minority stockholders ownership percentage share of net income of alhi prior to our acquisition of this minority interest 
the minority shareholder ownership percentage was through september   the date at which the minority interest was acquired 
as a result of our acquisition of the minority interest  there is no net income applicable to the minority interest after change in accounting 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  in accordance with the provisions of the statement  we recorded the differences between the previous carrying amounts of our derivative instruments and the fair value of our derivative instruments  as of this initial application date  as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
the gross difference between carrying amounts and fair value amounts of our derivative instruments was a reduction of approximately million 
the dac and voba amortization impact from the derivative adjustments was approximately million and the income tax benefit was million  resulting in the net cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives of million

s cash flows from operations consist of dividends from subsidiaries  if declared and paid  interest from income on loans and advances to subsidiaries including a surplus note issued to us by alic  investment income on our assets and fees which we charge our subsidiaries  offset by the expenses incurred for debt service  salaries and other expenses 
we intend to rely primarily on dividends and interest income from our insurance subsidiaries in order to make dividend payments to our shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated under various state laws 
generally  under the various state statutes  our insurance subsidiaries dividends may be paid only from the earned surplus arising from their respective businesses and must receive the prior approval of the respective state regulator to pay any dividend that would exceed certain statutory limitations 
the current statutes generally limit any dividend  together with dividends paid out within the preceding months  to the greater of i of the respective company s policyowners statutory surplus as of the preceding year end or ii the statutory net gain from operations for the previous calendar year 
generally  the various state laws give the state regulators discretion to approve or disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits 
based on these limitations and results  our life insurance subsidiaries could have paid us an estimated million in dividends in without obtaining regulatory approval 
our subsidiaries paid us million in based on results  our subsidiaries can pay an estimated million in dividends without obtaining regulatory approval during we also consider risk based capital levels  capital and liquidity operating needs  and other factors prior to paying dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
we generated cash flows from operating activities of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
operating cash flows were primarily used to increase our investment portfolio 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders which we refer to as the revolving credit agreement 
as of december   there was a million outstanding loan balance under the facility 
the revolving credit agreement provides for typical events of default and covenants with respect to the conduct of business and requires the maintenance of various financial levels and ratios 
among other covenants  we a cannot have a leverage ratio greater than  b cannot have an interest coverage ratio less than  c are prohibited from paying cash dividends on common stock in excess of an amount equal to of consolidated net worth as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year  and d must cause our insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain levels of risk based capital

our board of directors approved a stock purchase program effective august   under which we may purchase up to three million shares of our common stock at such times and under such conditions  as we deem advisable 
the purchases may be made in the open market or by such other means as we determine to be appropriate  including privately negotiated purchases 
the purchase program supercedes all prior purchase programs 
we plan to fund the purchase program from a combination of our internal sources  dividends from insurance subsidiaries and revolving credit agreement 
we repurchased shares in the first six months of under prior purchase programs 
during the first six months of  million shares were repurchased and were primarily funded by approximately million from the oceans offering and approximately million from the revolving credit agreement 
during the last six months of  approximately million shares were repurchased and were primarily funded by approximately million from the revolving credit agreement 
we establish internal targeted capital and surplus levels for our insurance subsidiaries  which are in excess of regulatory requirements 
as a result of high annuity product sales and related regulatory requirements on statutory capital and surplus  additional capital contributions were provided for at the end of to certain of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain these levels 
approximately million was drawn on the revolving credit facility to fund these capital contributions during the first quarter of we manage liquidity on a continuing basis 
one way is to minimize our need for capital 
we accomplish this by attempting to use our capital as efficiently as possible and by developing capital efficient products in our insurance subsidiaries 
we also manage our mix of sales by focusing on the more capital efficient products 
in addition  we use reinsurance agreements  where cost effective  to generate capital in the insurance subsidiaries 
we also focus on optimizing the consolidated capital structure to properly balance the levels and sources of borrowing and the issuance of equity securities 
we are currently exploring additional alternatives for increasing liquidity 
insurance subsidiaries the cash flows of our insurance subsidiaries consist primarily of premium income  deposits to policyowner account balances  income from investments  sales  maturities and calls of investments and repayments of investment principal 
cash outflows are primarily related to withdrawals of policyowner account balances  investment purchases  payment of policy acquisition costs  payment of policyowner benefits  payment of debt  income taxes and current operating expenses 
insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow from operations  as measured by the amount by which cash flows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyowners and normal operating expenses as they are incurred 
the remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing new business 
management believes that the current level of cash and available for sale and short term securities  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments  principal payments on mortgage backed securities and its insurance products  will be adequate to meet the anticipated short term cash obligations of the insurance subsidiaries 
matching the investment portfolio maturities to the cash flow demands of the type of insurance being provided is an important consideration for each type of protection product and accumulation product 
we continuously monitor benefits and surrenders to provide projections of future cash requirements 
as part of this monitoring process  we perform cash flow testing of assets and liabilities under various scenarios to evaluate the adequacy of reserves 
in developing our investment strategy  we establish a level of cash and securities which  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments and principal payments on mortgage backed securities  are believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations 
there can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since withdrawal and surrender levels are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment and general economic conditions and the claims paying and financial strength ratings of the insurance subsidiaries 
we take into account asset liability management considerations in the product development and design process 
contract terms for the interest sensitive products include surrender and withdrawal provisions which mitigate the risk of losses due to early withdrawals 
these provisions generally do one or more of the following limit the amount of penalty free withdrawals  limit the circumstances under which withdrawals are permitted  or assess a surrender charge or market value adjustment relating to the underlying assets 
the following table summarizes statutory liabilities for interest sensitive life products and annuities by their contractual withdrawal provisions at december  including liabilities in the closed blocks and the general account in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges a market value adjustments subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments total a includes  million of statutory liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than five percent of the account balance 
in addition to the interest sensitive products  an insurance subsidiary is party to a million fixed rate funding agreement 
under the transaction  a five year floating rate insurance contract was issued to a commercial paper conduit and the liability was swapped to a fixed rate 
during  our insurance subsidiaries placed additional funding agreements totaling million primarily in six to ten year fixed rate insurance contracts 
the assets backing the funding agreements are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the insurance subsidiaries 
the funding agreements are further backed by the general account assets of the insurance subsidiaries 
the segregated assets and liabilities are included with general account assets in the financial statements 
the funding agreements may not be cancelled unless there is a default under the agreement  but the insurance subsidiaries may terminate the agreement at any time 
in addition  there are variable separate account assets and liabilities representing funds that are separately administered  principally for variable annuity contracts  and for which the contractholder bears the investment risk 
separate account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and amounted to million at december  separate account contractholders have no claim against the assets of the general account 
the operations of the separate accounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
through their respective memberships in the federal home loan banks fhlb of des moines and topeka  alic and american investors life insurance company  inc are eligible to borrow under variable rate short term fed funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity 
these borrowings are secured and interest is payable at the current rate at the time of each advance 
there were no borrowings under these arrangements outstanding at december  in addition  alic has long term fixed rate advances from the fhlb outstanding of million at december  the insurance subsidiaries may also obtain liquidity through sales of investments 
the investment portfolio as of december   had a carrying value of billion  including closed block investments 
the level of capital in the insurance companies is also regulated by risk based capital formulas and is monitored by rating agencies 
in order to maintain appropriate capital levels  it may be necessary from time to time for amerus group co 
to provide additional capital to the insurance companies 
in the current economic environment  including the decline in the interest rates and in the bond and equity markets  insurance regulators are closely monitoring the capital and liquidity position of insurance companies in their periodic financial examinations 
one of our insurance subsidiaries which is no longer writing new business is now under its periodic financial examination and is involved in discussions with state examiners concerning its capital position 
the company believes that these discussions will be concluded without any material effect upon the company s consolidated financial position or results of operation  but that some contribution of capital to that subsidiary may be appropriate 
at december   the statutory surplus of the insurance subsidiaries was approximately million 
management believes that each insurance company has statutory capital which provides adequate risk based capital that exceeds required levels 
in the future  in addition to cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity  the insurance subsidiaries may obtain their required capital from amerus group co 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of amounts owed for notes payable and operating lease commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the notes payable and note for additional information regarding leases 
maturities of notes payable and lease obligations are as follows for each of the five years ending december  obligation total thereafter in thousands optionally convertible equity linked accreting notes senior notes revolving credit agreement surplus note federal home loan bank advances capital securities series a quarterly income preferred securities operating leases we have an agreement with bank one  na whereby we guarantee the payment of loans made to certain managers and executives for the purpose of purchasing common stock and aces pursuant to the stock purchase program 
our liability in respect of the principal amount of loans is limited to million 
we have also guaranteed interest and all other fees and obligations owing on the loans 
each participant in the program has agreed to repay any amounts paid by us under the guarantee in accordance with a reimbursement agreement with the participant 
this agreement was entered into in  prior to the restrictions imposed by the sarbanes oxley act regarding loans with executive officers 
we have obligations to make future capital contributions to various partnerships of up to million and to loan funds up to million to partnerships 
in addition  at december   we had loan guarantees which totaled million 
alic and its joint venture partner are contingently liable in the event the joint venture  avlic  cannot meet its obligations 
at december   avlic had statutory assets of  million  liabilities of  million and surplus of million 
we are contingently liable for the portion of the policies reinsured under existing reinsurance agreements in the event the reinsurance companies are unable to pay their portion of any reinsured claim 
management believes that any liability from this contingency is unlikely 
however  to limit the possibility of such losses  we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk 
investment portfolio general we maintain a diversified portfolio of investments which is supervised by an experienced in house staff of investment professionals 
sophisticated asset liability management techniques are employed in order to achieve competitive yields  while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
the asset portfolio is segmented by liability type  with tailored investment strategies for specific product lines 
investment policies and significant individual investments are subject to approval by the board of directors of each of the insurance companies and are overseen by the investment and risk management committee of our board of directors 
management regularly monitors individual assets and asset groups  in addition to monitoring the overall asset mix 
in addition  the insurance companies boards and the investment and risk management committee review investment guidelines and monitor internal controls 
investment strategy our investment philosophy is to employ an integrated asset liability management approach with separate investment portfolios for specific product lines  such as traditional life  universal life  equity indexed life  deferred fixed annuities  equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and funding agreements to generate attractive risk adjusted returns on capital 
essential to this philosophy is coordinating investments in the investment portfolio with product strategies  focusing on risk adjusted returns and identifying and evaluating associated business risks 
investment policies and strategies have been established based on the specific characteristics of each product line 
the portfolio investment policies and strategies establish asset duration  quality and other guidelines 
analytical systems are utilized to establish an optimal asset mix for each line of business 
we seek to manage the asset liability mismatch and the associated interest rate risk through active management of the investment portfolio 
financial  actuarial  investment  product development and product marketing professionals work together throughout the product development  introduction and management phases to jointly develop and implement product features  initial and renewal crediting strategies  and investment strategies based on extensive modeling of a variety of factors under a number of interest rate scenarios 
invested assets our diversified portfolio of investments includes public and private fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans 
our objective is to maintain a high quality  diversified fixed maturity securities portfolio that produces a yield and total return that supports the various product line liabilities and our earnings goals

as of december   asset backed residential mortgages total million or of total invested assets 
as of december   residential mortgage pass through and cmos total  million or of total invested assets 
as of december    million or of mbs were from government sponsored enterprises 
other mbs were million or of mbs as of december  management believes that the quality of assets in the mbs portfolio is generally high  with of such assets representing agency backed or aaa rated securities 
collateralized mortgage backed securities or cmbs total million or of total invested assets as of december  interest rate swaps and options are used to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and to manage duration mismatches 
call options are used to hedge equity indexed products 
credit default swaps are coupled with a bond to synthetically create an investment cheaper than the equivalent instrument traded in the cash market 
although we are subject to the risk that counterparties will fail to perform  credit standings of counterparties are monitored regularly 
we only enter into transactions with highly rated counterparties 
we are also subject to the risk associated with changes in the value of contracts 
however  such adverse changes in value generally are offset by changes in the value of the items being hedged 
the notional principal amounts of the swaps and options  which represent the extent of our involvement in such contracts but not the risk of loss  at december   amounted to  million 
the interest rate swaps had a carrying value of a net payable position of million at december  the credit default swaps had a carrying value of a net payable position of million at december  the carrying value of options amounted to million at december  for each of these derivatives  the carrying value is equal to fair value as of december  the derivatives are reflected as other investments on the consolidated financial statements as of december  the net amount payable or receivable from interest rate and credit default swaps are accrued as an adjustment to interest income 
effective january   we adopted sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of adopting sfas mortgage loans as of december   mortgage loans in the investment portfolio were million  or of the aggregate carrying value of invested assets 
as of december   commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans comprised and  respectively  of total mortgage loans 
commercial mortgage loans consist primarily of fixed rate mortgage loans 
as of december   we held individual commercial mortgage loans with an average balance of million 
as of december   one loan in the loan portfolio with a principal balance of million was classified as delinquent and no loans were in foreclosure 
as of the same date  only two loans aggregating million  or  of the loan portfolio as measured by principal balance were classified as restructured 
during  we had no foreclosures 
other we held million of policy loans on individual insurance products as of december  policy loans are permitted to the extent of a policy s contractual limits and are fully collateralized by policy cash values 
as of december   we held equity securities of million of which the largest holding was federal home loan bank common stock totaling million 
we held million of other invested assets including short term investments and real estate on december  other invested assets consist primarily of our ameritas joint venture investment  various other joint ventures and limited partnership investments and derivatives 
structured securities arrangements we have utilized a limited number of structured finance arrangements 
the structures primarily consist of interests in collateralized bond obligations and special purpose entities with principal protected limited partnership interests 
neither amerus nor any management members have operating control or management oversight of the entities and accordingly the entities are not consolidated but rather accounted for as available for sale debt securities or equity method investments 
in addition  we do not have any continued obligation or commitment to provide additional financing to the entities 
at december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of such structured finance investments were included in invested assets 
see additional discussion of structured securities and related accounting developments in emerging accounting matters 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the consolidated results of operations 
interest rate changes may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of the protection products and accumulation products offered 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuities or life insurance products offered by competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds  and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of our products until we increase the interest rate credited to owners of our protection products and accumulation products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we attempt to adjust credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in reinvestment rates 
we monitor interest rates and sell annuities and life insurance policies that permit flexibility to make interest rate changes as part of management of interest spreads 
however  the profitability of our products is based upon persistency  mortality and expenses  as well as interest rate spreads 
we manage our investment portfolio in part to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes 
we have developed an asset liability management approach with separate investment portfolios for major product lines such as traditional life  universal life  equity indexed life  deferred annuities  equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and funding agreements 
investment policies and strategies have been established based on the specific characteristics of each product line 
the portfolio investment policies and strategies establish asset duration  quality and other guidelines 
analytical systems are utilized to establish an optimal asset mix for each line of business 
we seek to manage the asset liability mismatch and the associated interest rate risk through active management of the investment portfolio 
financial  actuarial  investment  product development and product marketing professionals work together throughout the product development  introduction and management phases to jointly develop and implement product features  initial and renewal crediting strategies  and investment strategies based on extensive modeling of a variety of factors under a number of interest rate scenarios 
in force reserves and the assets allocated to each segment are modeled on a regular basis to analyze projected cash flows under a variety of economic scenarios 
the result of this modeling is used to modify asset allocation  investment portfolio duration and renewal crediting strategies 
we invest in derivatives to hedge against the effects of interest rate fluctuations or to hedge growth in policyowner liabilities for certain life and annuity products and funding agreements 
for a further discussion and disclosure of the nature and extent of the use of derivatives  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
federal income tax matters amerus group and our non life subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the life insurance subsidiaries file separate federal income tax returns  except for ilic  bankers life and il annuity which together file a consolidated tax return beginning in the separate return method is used to compute the provision for allocating federal income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences among the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following are considered our critical accounting policies due to their subjective nature and significance to the financial statements 
valuation of financial instruments a significant portion of our assets are carried at fair value  primarily securities available for sale  securities held for trading purposes and derivative financial instruments 
market values are based on quoted market prices where available 
securities in our portfolio with a carrying value of approximately  million at december  do not have readily determinable market prices 
for these securities  we estimate their fair value by comparison to similar securities with quoted prices when possible 
otherwise  we use our most recent purchases and sales of similar unquoted securities  independent broker quotes  or internally prepared valuations including those based on estimates of future profitability to estimate the fair value of those securities 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
our ability to liquidate our positions in these securities will be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and we may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  our key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors may not be realized in the event of an actual sale 
securities are also reviewed to identify potential impairments 
in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples  and other key measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt instruments 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
investments in mortgage loans  real estate  policy loans and other investments are monitored for possible impairment 
if it is determined that collection of all amounts due under the contractual terms is doubtful or carrying values exceed the fair value of underlying collateral  such investments are considered impaired and the asset carrying value is adjusted or a valuation allowance is established 
derivatives we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge growth in policyowner liabilities for certain life and annuity products  to hedge the interest variability of a floating rate funding agreement and to hedge market risk for fixed income investments 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting or are considered economic hedges as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging relationships involving derivative instruments 
economic hedging instruments are those instruments whose change in fair value acts as a natural hedge against the change in fair value of hedged assets or liabilities with both changes wholly or partially being offset in earnings 
to hedge equity market risk  we primarily use s p index call options to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as provided by our equity indexed life and annuity products 
we also use interest rate swaps to effectively provide for fixed interest payments of a floating rate funding agreement liability and hedge market risk from fixed income investments 
credit default swaps are coupled with a bond to synthetically create an instrument cheaper than an equivalent investment traded in the cash market 
we have not changed our methods of calculating the fair values of derivatives or the underlying assumptions 
the fair values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
our derivative instruments are not subject to a multiple or use of leverage on the underlying price index 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate or equity hedges as the counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
information about the fair values  notional amounts  and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
amortization of dac and voba we generally amortize dac based on a percentage of our expected gross margins egms over the life of the policies 
our estimated egms are computed based on assumptions related to the underlying policies written  including the lives of the underlying policies  growth rate of the assets supporting the liabilities  and level of expenses necessary to maintain the policies over their entire life 
we amortize dac by estimating the present value of the egms over the lives of the insurance policies and then calculate a percentage of the policy acquisition cost deferred as compared to the present value of the egms 
that percentage is used to amortize the dac such that the amount amortized over the life of the policies results in a constant percentage of amortization when related to the actual and future gross margins 
because the egms are only an estimate of the profits we expect to recognize from these policies  the egms are adjusted at each balance sheet date to take into consideration the actual gross profits to date and any changes in the remaining expected future gross margins 
when egms are adjusted  we also adjust the amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs amount to maintain a constant percentage over the entire life of the policies 
we amortize the voba based on the incidence of the expected cash flows from insurance contracts using the interest rate credited to the underlying policies 
the expected future cash flows are based on actuarially determined projections of future premium receipts  mortality  surrenders  operating expenses  changes in insurance liabilities  investment yields on the assets retained to support the policy liabilities and other factors 
these projections take into account all factors known or expected by management 
the actual cash flows may vary from expected levels due to differences in renewal premium  investment spread  investment gains or losses  mortality and morbidity costs and other factors 
purchase accounting valuations we followed the purchase method of accounting for our acquisition of ilico in may under the purchase method  we were required to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
the fair value of the assets and liabilities were determined as follows investments based on quoted market prices  or in cases where quoted market prices were not available  by using discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques 
receivables and other assets reflected at replacement values or realizable values based on the present value of amounts to be received determined at appropriate interest rates less amounts considered uncollectible 
value of business acquired actuarially determined future profits from in force business calculated at a risk discount rate using current best estimate assumptions 
policyowner reserves and funds established at the present value of all future benefits and expenses associated with the policies using current best estimate assumptions 
other liabilities and debt determined as the present value of amounts to be paid using appropriate interest rates 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired for ilico was recorded as goodwill amounting to million 
emerging accounting matters sfas and sfas in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business acquisition must meet to be recognized apart from goodwill 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to no longer be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the evaluation of the impairment analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets  principally voba  was completed in with no impairment indicated as of january  in addition  a reassessment was performed as of october  in conjunction with our annual evaluation which resulted in no indication of impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas sfas in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas provides for costs to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets to be recorded when they are incurred and are to be measured at fair value 
under previous accounting guidance  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and its adoption had no impact on net income or stockholders equity as of or for the year ended december  sfas in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
as of december   we continue to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method provided under sfas and sfas the disclosure requirements of both standards have been provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fin in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin fin clarifies disclosure and recognition and measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition and measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to our guarantees 
fin in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb  or fin fin provides guidance to identify variable interest entities  or vies  and their consolidation by a primary beneficiary 
a vie is defined as an entity in which either the equity investors  if any  do not have a controlling financial interest  or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
an enterprise whose investment in a vie absorbs the majority of the vie s expected losses or receives a majority of its expected residual returns is considered a primary beneficiary  although not all vies will have a primary beneficiary 
fin requires primary beneficiaries to consolidate vies in their financial statements and also requires additional disclosures for enterprises which are not primary beneficiaries but which have a significant variable interest in a vie 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for vies created after january  and is to be applied in the first interim period beginning after june  for interests in vies acquired before february  the additional disclosure is required for financial statements issued after january  at december   we held interests in structured securities arrangements which meet the definition of vies 
we would be considered the primary beneficiary for several of those structured securities  which if consolidated at december   would result in an increase in total assets of million  an increase in total liabilities of million and an increase in total stockholders equity of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures and additional information related to our vie interests 
sfas implementation embedded derivatives in february  the financial accounting standards board s derivatives implementation group issued sfas implementation issue no 
b  embedded derivatives bifurcation of a debt instrument that incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument  or dig issue b dig issue b applies to modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements where interest is determined by reference to a pool of fixed maturity assets or a total return debt index 
such arrangements in which funds are withheld by the ceding insurer cause the reinsurer to recognize a receivable from the ceding insurer as well as a liability representing reserves for the insurance coverage assumed under the reinsurance arrangements 
the terms of the reinsurer s receivable provide for the future payment of principal plus a rate of return on either its general account assets or a specified block of those assets which is typically composed of fixed rate debt securities 
dig issue b considers the reinsurer s receivable from the ceding company to contain an embedded derivative that must be bifurcated and accounted for separately under sfas dig issue b is tentatively planned to be effective for quarters beginning after june  currently  we do not account for such reinsurance receivables and payables as having an embedded derivative which would be bifurcated and accounted for separately 
we continue to evaluate the impacts of implementing dig issue b  however  at this time  we are unable to estimate the effects on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios and our insurance subsidiaries are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including asset liability management  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks related to our financial instruments primarily relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes us to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality and prepayment variation 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
management views these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability management 
actuarial professionals estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily lapses  to determine duration  which is the present value of the fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which management believes mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk 
for variable and equity indexed products  profitability on the portion of the policyholder s account balance invested in the fixed general account option  if any  is also affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited to the policies 
for the variable products  the policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts 
for the equity indexed products  we purchase call options that are designed to match the return owed to contract holders who elect to participate in one or more market indices 
profitability on the portion of the equity indexed products tied to market indices is significantly impacted by the spread on interest earned on investments and the sum of cost of underlying call options purchased to match the returns owed to contract holders and minimum interest guarantees owed to the contract holder  if any 
profitability on the equity indexed products is also impacted by changes in the fair value of the embedded option which provides the contract holder the right to participate in market index returns after the next anniversary date of the contract 
this impacts profitability as we only purchase one year call options to fund the returns owed to the contract holders at the inception of each contract year 
this practice matches with the contract holders rights to switch to different indices on each anniversary date 
the value of the forward starting options embedded in the equity index can fluctuate with changes in assumptions as to future volatility of the market indices  risk free interest rates  market returns and the lives of the contracts 
the table below provides information about our fixed maturity investments and mortgage loans for both our trading and other than trading portfolios at december  the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
as of december  expected cash flows amortized fair thereafter cost value in millions fixed maturity securities available for sale average interest rate fixed maturity securities held for trading purposes average interest rate mortgage loans average interest rate total in accordance with our strategy of minimizing credit quality risk  we consistently invest in high quality marketable securities 
fixed maturity securities are comprised of us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed and corporate securities 
approximately of fixed maturity securities are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or are rated a or better by moody s  standard and poor s  or the naic 
less than of the bond portfolio is below investment grade 
fixed maturity securities have an average maturity of approximately years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within the portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
management monitors such risk regularly 
we invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that have average or lower prepayment risk 
our use of derivatives is generally limited to hedging purposes and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps and options 
these instruments  viewed separately  subject us to varying degrees of market and credit risk 
however when used for hedging  the expectation is that these instruments would reduce overall market risk 
credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties may fail to perform under the terms of the contracts
