item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december  this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on management s plans that are subject to uncertainty 
we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item of this report  under the section factors influencing future results and accuracy of forward looking statements 
this discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements  we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain of the information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events  cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
the most difficult  subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty are related to our accounting for landfills  environmental liabilities and asset impairments  as described below 
the discussion below details our accounting policies for landfills through december  as of january   our practice will change upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounting for landfills we utilize the life cycle method of accounting for landfill costs and the units of consumption method to amortize landfill construction costs and record closure and post closure obligations over the estimated remaining useful life of a landfill 
under this method we include future estimated construction costs  as well as costs incurred to date  in the amortization base 
additionally  we include probable expansion airspace that has yet to be permitted in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill 
this accounting method requires us to make estimates and assumptions  as described below 
any changes in our estimates will impact our income from operations prospectively from the date the changes are made 
landfill costs we assess the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity 
this includes certain projected landfill costs that are uncertain because they are dependent on future events 
the total cost to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs  landfill final capping costs  liner construction costs  operating construction costs  and capitalized interest costs 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  we expect to incur billion during the remaining operating lives of the landfills 
the future costs will be capitalized as incurred and expensed over the useful lives of the landfills as airspace is consumed 
closure and post closure costs the costs for closure and post closure obligations at landfills we own or operate are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
the estimates for landfill final closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in  where appropriate  inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain 
while the precise amount of future closure and post closure costs cannot be determined with certainty  we estimate that the aggregate cost of landfill closure and post closure as of december  is approximately billion 
available airspace our engineers determine the useful life at our landfills by estimating the available airspace 
this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate  based on height restrictions and other factors  how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity 
expansion airspace we also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances 
first  to include airspace associated with an expansion effort  we must generally expect the expansion permit application to be submitted within one year  and the expansion permit to be received within five years 
second  we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is probable  using the following criteria personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local and state approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill  at the time the expansion is added to the permitted site life  it is probable that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located  either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan  there are no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion  financial analysis has been completed  and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact  and airspace and related costs  including additional closure and post closure costs  have been estimated based on conceptual design 
these criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
however  our policy provides that  based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill  if these criteria are not met  inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed 
in these circumstances  inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
of the landfill sites with expansions at december   landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace 
approximately two thirds of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because of legal or community issues that could impede the expansion process  while the remaining were primarily due to permit application processes beyond the one year limit  which in most cases were due to state specific permitting procedures 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace  we also include the projected costs for development  final capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
it is possible that any of our estimates or assumptions could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from actual results 
in some cases we may be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an expansion permit that we previously thought was probable has become unlikely 
to the extent that such estimates  or the assumptions used to make those estimates  prove to be significantly different than actual results  or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner  the costs of the landfill  including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion  may be subject to impairment testing  as described below  and lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher closure and post closure rates  and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace 
after determining the costs at our landfills  including closure and post closure costs  and the available and probable expansion airspace  we then determine the per ton rate that will be expensed 
we look at factors such as the waste stream  geography and rate of compaction  among others  to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace 
we then divide our costs by that number of tons  giving us the rate per ton to expense 
the average landfill airspace amortization cost per ton for the landfills operating at december  was per ton as compared to for the landfills at december  as of december  and  the net book value recorded for capitalized landfill site costs was billion and billion  respectively 
the average landfill closure and post closure expense  on a per ton basis  for the landfills operating at december  was per ton as compared to for the landfills at december  as of december  and  we had recorded landfill closure and post closure liabilities of million and million  respectively 
environmental remediation liabilities under current laws and regulations  we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations  or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a particular site 
remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business 
these costs include legal defense  potentially responsible party prp investigation  settlement  and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances 
we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation  including sites listed on the epa s national priorities list npl sites 
we consider whether we were an owner  operator  transporter  or generator at the site  the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site 
next  we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed prps 
we then estimate the cost for the likely remedy  which is based on management s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties sites  information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation  the number  financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other prps who may be liable for remediation of a specific site  and the typical allocation of costs among prps 
these estimates are sometimes a range of reasonably possible outcomes 
in those cases  we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate 
if no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other  we use the amounts that are the low ends of such ranges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
and its interpretations 
were we to use the high ends of such ranges  our potential liability would be approximately million higher on a discounted basis in the aggregate than the estimate recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december  as used in this context  reasonably possible means we believe it is more than remote but less than likely 
as of december  and  we had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  for the present value of remediation costs for our sites 
asset impairments our long lived assets  including landfills and landfill expansions  are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
however  accounting standards require us to write down these assets if they become impaired 
if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is determined by either an actual third party evaluation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset 
cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets  rather than a single asset 
if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset  we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows 
if the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 
typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if any of these or other indicators occur  we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment 
several of these indicators are beyond our control  and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur 
additionally  estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill  as described below 
landfills there are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects 
for example  a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted 
in addition  management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace 
therefore  certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry 
goodwill we assess whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances  such as those listed above  that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired

as shown below  nasw is our principal operation  which is comprised of six operating groups within north america  along with our other nasw services 
our other operations consisted of waste management services in international markets and non solid waste services  all of which were divested as of march  years ended december  in millions canada eastern    midwest    southern    western    wti other nasw intercompany    total nasw    other  net operating revenues    our nasw operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection  disposal  and transfer station services 
some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance  a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided 
revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly 
fees charged at transfer stations are based on the volume of waste deposited  taking into account our cost of loading  transporting  and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site 
intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the mix of nasw operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below in millions 
years ended december  collection    landfill    transfer    wti waste to energy and ipps recycling and other intercompany    total nasw    the period to period change in nasw revenues is reflected in the table below dollars in millions 
period to period period to period change for change for and and price base business commodity electricity fuel total price volume internal growth acquisitions divestitures foreign currency translation nasw revenues decreased by million in as compared to we experienced negative internal growth in our nasw operations of  or million  which was substantially volume related 
the negative volume decline of  or million  compared to is largely related to commercial and industrial collection services throughout our operations  with the exception of the southern portion of the united states  where we realized slight volume increases 
we also experienced declines in disposal revenue due to volume primarily in the eastern and western portions of the united states 
we believe that the overall decreased volumes  particularly in the higher margin commercial and industrial collection services  were attributable to the lagging economy and increased competition 
however  offsetting these declines were increases in volumes related to our recycling operations of million in as compared to offsetting the decrease in revenue due to volume declines were price related revenue increases of million  or  in as compared to of this increase  million  or  is attributable to the significant increase in commodity prices of occ and onp 
occ prices increased to an average price of per ton for as compared to an average price of per ton for reduced electricity rates in california and reduced fuel surcharges negatively impacted the price related revenue change by million  or 
revenue change due to price in our base business reflected an increase of million  or  was derived from our commercial and residential collection and transfer station operations 
these price related revenue increases were offset partially by decreased pricing in our landfill special waste operations 
we also experienced increases in revenue of million in from acquisitions consummated during and the full year effect of acquisitions completed in offsetting this was a decrease in revenue of million due to divestitures and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations related to the canadian dollar 
nasw revenues decreased from to by million due primarily to divestitures of our non integrated nasw operations during we also experienced a reduction of revenue due to volume of million  largely attributable to the overall slowing of the north american economy  the termination of unprofitable accounts and the impact of our policy change for third party brokers  which required more stringent contract requirements  resulting in the loss of some brokered waste 
nasw operating revenues also declined because of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the canadian dollar  which reduced revenues by million 
in addition  revenue changes due to price reflected a decline of million due to combined revenue declines of million from recycling commodities and electricity sales by ipps  substantially offset by increased revenues due to price in the base business of million 
offsetting these revenue declines were the acquisition of certain nasw operations in and the year over year effect of acquisitions of nasw operations in operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits  fuel  maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations  and accruals for future landfill closure and post closure costs and environmental remediation 
certain direct landfill development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed  and include acquisition  engineering  upgrading  construction  capitalized interest  and permitting costs 
additionally  we sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related remedial  defense and tort claim costs 
such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses 
our operating costs and expenses increased in as compared to  and decreased in as compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  operating costs and expenses decreased from in to in and increased to in the most significant factor causing the change in operating expenses between and was the offset to operating costs and expenses of approximately million recorded in for the recovery of claims against insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses 
operating expenses were also higher in as compared to because of i increases in salary  wages and employee benefit costs  ii higher workers compensation costs  iii increases in disposal and subcontractor costs and iv higher costs associated with recycling commodities 
the headcount reductions associated with our march reorganization allowed us to realize significant cost reductions 
however  the reorganization also resulted in a re characterization of certain costs that were reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in prior periods due to changes in certain roles and responsibilities 
this change  along with additional costs associated with annual merit increases  more than offset the decrease in operating expenses as a result of the headcount reductions 
disposal cost increases were primarily related to increased taxes on the disposal of waste in pennsylvania  which were partially offset by decreases in disposal costs due to declines in volumes in as compared with subcontractor cost increases included increased utilization of subcontractors for certain of our national account customers in areas where services are not provided by us and increased use of third party transportation of waste to disposal facilities 
the increased costs associated with recycling commodities were due primarily to an increase in market prices paid for occ and onp  which resulted in increased rebates paid to customers 
offsetting these increases was the effect of divestitures of our international operations in and the non solid waste operations in the first quarter of the divestitures decreased operating expenses by approximately million in as compared to also offsetting the increased costs and expenses in as compared with were lower fuel costs  including fuel used to operate our ipps  reduced maintenance costs and lower construction services at certain of our waste to energy facilities that we operate but do not own 
the year to year decline in operating costs and expenses between and was primarily caused by the sales of our international  non solid waste and non integrated nasw operations 
these sales occurred throughout and into adding to the decrease was the effect of the volume declines in as compared to  as described in the discussion of nasw operating revenues 
additionally  in we initiated cost saving improvements in our procurement practices and began to develop more standardized operating procedures 
our improvements continued in and caused further decreases in operating costs and expenses into in we implemented other cost saving initiatives  such as preventative maintenance programs that created an overall reduction in repair and maintenance costs 
finally  in we aggressively pursued our claims against insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses  recovering approximately million in as compared to million in  which were recorded as an offset to operating costs and expenses 
if we excluded the insurance recoveries  operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues would have been in selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative costs  marketing costs  professional services  facility rentals  provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs  as well as costs related to our sales force and customer service 
our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in as compared to  and decreased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  our selling  general and administrative expenses were for  for and for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to is primarily attributable to management s focus on reducing spending related to professional fees  travel and entertainment  and other administrative costs 
additionally  expenses decreased due to headcount reductions and the re characterization of certain expenses as costs of operations rather than selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of the march restructuring 
finally  costs further decreased due to the divestitures of non solid waste and international operations in and in early the reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses were offset partially by increased costs associated with both litigation settlements and expense  higher bad debt expense largely attributable to the weaker economy  workers compensation costs  and property related costs such as property taxes  maintenance and security 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues decreased in as compared with because of these same factors  since operating revenues remained essentially flat between the two periods 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues from to is due to the decrease in nasw revenues in the corresponding periods as discussed above 
however  the decrease in actual selling  general and administrative expenses from as compared to is due mostly to the divestitures that we completed throughout in addition  as discussed below  we had significant costs in related to accounting and process improvement initiatives 
these costs were not as significant in  as we were able to stabilize our accounting systems and substantially complete our process improvement initiatives in the second half of offsetting these decreases were costs related to corporate staffing increases  which began primarily in and continued in in  we incurred significant costs for our process improvement initiatives and accounting assistance 
these costs were mainly in the first half of because  by the second half of  we had stabilized our accounting systems and completed our process improvement initiatives  which significantly reduced our ongoing need for these services 
in  we incurred approximately million for professional accounting and process improvement consulting services and consulting services related to the implementation of new enterprise information systems 
we also incurred approximately million related to our divestitures  improvements to our billing systems and verification of our customer base  and legal fees related to certain stockholder litigation and other sec matters 
however  in we were successful in collecting certain accounts that were reserved for in  favorably impacting our provision for bad debt in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of intangible assets with a definite life other than goodwill on a straight line basis  generally to years  or over the definitive terms of the related agreements  ii depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from to years  and iii amortization of landfill costs on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site 
in and  depreciation and amortization expense also included the amortization of goodwill on a straight line basis over a period of years or less  commencing on the dates of the respective acquisition 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in as compared to and decreased in as compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization expense was in  in and in the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in is primarily attributable to our adoption of sfas no 
 which required that the amortization of all goodwill cease on january  goodwill amortization for was million  or of operating revenues 
excluding the effect of goodwill amortization expense in  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased from compared to the decrease in depreciation and amortization in is attributable to the amortization expense of goodwill on operations that were divested throughout  more cost effective use of our landfill assets in and a temporary increase in fully depreciated trucks and other equipment associated with delays in receiving new equipment in the first half of the following schedule reflects the and adjusted net income excluding goodwill and negative goodwill amortization as compared to the results of operations for december  in millions  except per share amounts 
years ended december  reported net income loss add back goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income basic earnings per common share reported net income loss goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income diluted earnings per common share reported net income loss goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income restructuring in  we adopted and implemented a new organizational structure to better align collection  transport  recycling and disposal resources within market areas 
we believe the new structure will yield a number of benefits  including clearer accountability and responsibility for business performance and profitability in specific markets  simplification of structure  cost savings through consolidation of duplicate administrative and other support functions  improved utilization of operating assets  and better customer responsiveness 
in march all of our operations  other than wti and cws  were restructured to reduce the number of field layers of management from four to three and the number of field layers that have administrative staff from four to two 
under the new structure  our approximately  operating sites  including waste collection depots  transfer stations  landfills and recycling facilities  were restructured into approximately newly established market areas 
these market areas all report to one of four groups that divide the united states geographically into the eastern  midwest  southern and western operations  and which were formerly known as our areas 
cws  which was restructured into ten newly established market areas in july  and wti were the fifth and sixth areas under our previous structure continue as the fifth and sixth groups under the new structure 
we recorded million of pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new organizational structure 
these charges include million for employee severance and benefit costs and related to abandoned operating lease agreements 
under the new structure approximately  field level administrative and operational positions have been eliminated 
our obligation for severance payments will continue into as of december   payments of million for employee severance and benefits and for abandoned leases had been recorded against the restructuring liability that was previously established 
asset impairments and unusual items in  the net gain for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to i our receipt of approximately million related to a non revenue producing asset written down as an asset impairment in  ii net gains of approximately million on divestitures during the year and iii reductions to legal and loss contract reserves of approximately million and million  respectively  that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items 
in  the expense was comprised mainly of a charge of million  which is net of the recovery from our insurers and the stockholders derivative suit against our former independent public accountant  arthur andersen llp  for the settlement reached in connection with the stockholder class action lawsuit filed against us in july alleging violations of the federal securities laws 
the settlement  which is subject to court approval  provides for our payment to the class of million  and we believe the payment  which is expected to be made in  will result in a net cash outflow of approximately to million after considering insurance  tax deductions and related settlement costs 
in addition  we recorded a held for sale adjustment of approximately million related to our international operations along with a held for sale adjustment for an investment in mexican solid waste operations of approximately million 
offsetting these expenses was a net gain of million comprised of the reversal of the held for sale impairment of million and a held for use impairment of million from our decision during the third quarter of not to sell all but one of our ipps  and the reclassification in the third quarter of of all but one of our ipps from held for sale to held for use 
also included in asset impairments and unusual items for are reversals of certain loss contract reserves of million that we determined to be in excess of current requirements 
in  these costs were primarily due to our sale of our international operations and the termination of wm holdings defined benefit pension plan  which are more fully described in notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense our interest expense decreased consistently each year from to the primary factor for the decrease in interest expense in is our interest rate derivative contracts  which are utilized to manage our interest rate exposure and the general decline in interest rates 
interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by million for and contributed to the decrease by million in the remaining decrease in interest expense in is primarily due to the pay down of debt with proceeds from our divestitures and cash flows from operations 
in  the refinancing of debt instruments at lower interest rates created additional interest expense savings 
additionally  to further reduce interest expense we have increased our utilization of tax exempt bond financing over the past two years as a lower cost source of funding 
other income we experienced an increase in other income in as compared to prior years due primarily to the sale of an equity investment 
in  a company in which we held an approximately interest was acquired by another entity 
we held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition 
the proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  million and million for  and  respectively  resulting in an effective income tax rate of  and for each of the three years  respectively 
the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for is primarily due to state and local income taxes  offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits 
in addition  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million due to a capital gain generated in that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefited capital loss that arose from a divestiture 
a tax benefit of approximately million was also recognized in related to the carry back of losses by our dutch subsidiary 
the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for is primarily due to state and local income taxes  non deductible costs associated with the impairment of certain businesses  the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested  offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits 
additionally  in scheduled canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of million  which was offset in part by a tax expense of million related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested in canada 
the effective tax rate in is significantly higher than the federal statutory rate due to state and local income taxes  non deductible costs relating to acquired intangibles  write down of investments in subsidiaries and minority interest  sales of foreign subsidiaries and the cost associated with remitting earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested  offset in part by non conventional tax credits 
extraordinary items during the first quarter of  we refinanced approximately million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds maturing in with variable rate tax exempt bonds maturing in as a result  we incurred prepayment penalties and other fees for a total charge  net of tax benefit  of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  we elected to repay approximately million of our senior debt issuances prior to their maturity dates 
in connection with these repayments  we recognized an extraordinary charge of approximately million  net of tax benefit  for the prepayment penalties and other costs related to the retired debt 
in the first quarter of  we worked with local governmental authorities to refinance million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds maturing through with million of variable rate tax exempt bonds maturing through and million of fixed rate bonds that matured later in we recorded a net extraordinary loss of million for the remaining unamortized premium and issuance costs related to the retired debt 
on july   we issued million of mandatorily tendered senior notes  due july  the notes were subject to certain mandatory tender features as described in the indenture  which allowed us to purchase all of the outstanding notes on july  we used available cash on hand along with funds from our credit facility to purchase the notes in july during the third quarter of  we recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of taxes  for the retirement of this debt 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle as a result of adopting sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations  sfas no 
on january   we were required to write off amounts of negative goodwill that had been recorded in prior periods through purchase accounting 
the aggregate amount of negative goodwill was million and was recorded as a credit to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 
 became effective for us as of january  adoption of sfas no 
 resulted in a gain  net of tax  of approximately million in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended december   and in millions cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year cash provided by operating activities    cash provided by used in investing activities   cash used in financing activities   cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit  certificates of deposit  money market accounts  and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
our cash balances decreased million from december  to december  this decrease is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  our stock repurchase program and the repayment of portions of our senior note issuances prior to their maturity dates  which exceeded our existing cash balances and our billion of operating cash flow 
in  cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by cash received of million from counterparties for certain interest rate swap agreements that we terminated prior to the scheduled maturities  offset by cash paid of million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our debt issuances 
included in our investing activities was cash paid of billion for capital expenditures and million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds of million from other investing activities  primarily proceeds from sales of assets and net cash receipts from restricted funds 
included in our financing activities was cash paid of million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
in addition we paid million for net debt reductions and received million from exercises of common stock options and warrants 
in  we generated cash flows from operations of approximately billion 
favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against certain insurance carriers and million that we received from counterparties when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled maturities 
included in our investing activities was billion of capital expenditures and million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing activities of million 
in addition  we used million for financing activities  which is comprised of million of net debt reductions and million of other financing activities  offset by proceeds of million from exercises of common stock options and warrants  and other financing activities 
in  we spent million to acquire businesses  billion in capital expenditures and billion on net debt reductions 
we financed these cash expenditures primarily with billion of cash flows from operations and billion of proceeds from our divestitures 
a tax refund of approximately million and our improvements in accounts receivable average days sale outstanding favorably impacted cash flows from operations in we operate in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various financing sources is vital to our operations 
in the past  we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive 
based on several key factors we believe considered by credit rating agencies and financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing  we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future 
these factors include the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base  our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows  our asset base  and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation 
in addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations  we have capital requirements for i capital expenditures for construction and expansion of landfill sites  as well as new trucks and equipment for collection and other operations  ii refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy facilities and iii business acquisitions 
for  we currently expect to spend approximately billion to billion for capital expenditures 
in february we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program for up to billion in annual repurchases for each of  and  to be implemented at management s discretion 
we expect to utilize cash flows from operations for purchases made in either open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the following is a summary of activity for our stock repurchase program in millions  except shares in thousands and price per share in dollars 
agreement common stock net common purchase settlement stock transaction type initiating date settlement date shares price price received paid repurchases private accelerated purchase a march august  b private accelerated purchase a december february  c open market purchases d n a n a  n a a we accounted for the initial payment as a purchase of treasury stock and classified the future settlement with the counterparty as an equity instrument because we had the option under the agreement to settle our obligation  if any  in shares of our common stock 
b the weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately million less than the approximately million we initially paid 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the counterparty paid us this difference of approximately million at the end of the valuation period  which occurred during the third quarter of  to settle the agreement 
we accounted for the cash receipt as an adjustment to the carrying value of treasury stock and have therefore included it in common stock repurchases within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
c the weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately million less than the approximately million we initially paid 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the counterparty will pay us the difference of approximately million at the end of the valuation period to settle the agreement 
d we engaged in open market purchases when trading was allowed pursuant to law and our insider trading policy 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions thereafter total debt payments  excluding interest   expected aggregate environmental liabilities based on current cost a   non cancellable rental obligations  unconditional purchase obligations b anticipated liquidity impact as of december      a environmental liabilities include final closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations 
we have contingencies  including guarantee arrangements  that are deemed not reasonably likely and thus not included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
additionally  we expect a net cash outflow  after considering insurance  tax deductions and related settlement costs  of approximately to million in for settlement of our securities class action lawsuit 
the settlement fund began to accrue interest  at the federal funds rate  during the second quarter of  although payment will not become due until the judgment is final  which we expect to occur in to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations  as described above  our strategy is to utilize cash flows from operations 
we also have bank borrowings available to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations and  when appropriate  will obtain financing by issuing debt or common stock 
as of december   we had a million syndicated revolving credit facility the three year revolver  and a billion syndicated revolving credit facility the five year revolver 
the three year revolver matures in june and the five year revolver matures in june as of december   we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately billion of which approximately billion are issued under the revolving credit facilities that generally have terms allowing automatic renewal after a year 
at december   no balances were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had unused and available credit capacity under these facilities of approximately million 
as of december   the financial covenants we are required to maintain under our credit facilities include i an interest coverage ratio  ii total debt to ebitda and  iii minimum net worth  all as defined in the credit facilities solely for the purpose of determining compliance with the covenants 
the interest coverage ratio requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of a our consolidated net income plus interest expense and income taxes ebit for the four fiscal quarters then ending to b consolidated total interest expense for such period to be less than to for quarters ending on or before december  and to thereafter 
the total debt to ebitda covenant requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter  we will not permit the ratio of a all indebtedness and certain contingent liabilities such as financial guarantees to b ebit plus depreciation and amortization expense ebitda for the four fiscal quarters then ending to exceed to our minimum net worth covenant requires that we will not allow the sum of stockholders equity to be less than billion plus of our cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter  beginning with the first fiscal quarter ended march  at december   we are in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities and all other debt instruments 
in january  our total debt to ebitda covenant was amended to not permit that ratio to exceed to rather than to in november  we privately placed million of senior unsecured notes due interest on the notes is due on may and november of each year 
the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses 
we used these proceeds primarily to pay the million of senior notes that came due december in may  we privately placed million of senior unsecured notes due interest on the notes is due on november and may of each year 
the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses 
we used these proceeds to pay the million of senior notes that matured on july  and a portion of the million of senior notes that matured on october  additionally  we have issued industrial revenue bonds primarily for the construction of various facilities 
proceeds from these financing arrangements are directly deposited into trust funds and we do not have the ability to utilize the funds in regular operating activities 
accordingly  these amounts are reported as an investing activity when the cash is released from the trust funds and a financing activity when the industrial revenue bonds are repaid 
at december   approximately million of cash was held in trust to meet future capital expenditures at various facilities 
we have million of senior notes due december  we also have million of senior notes due august  that are subject to early redemption on august  at the option of the holders 
we have classified approximately million of these borrowings as long term at december  based upon our ability to use our revolving credit facilities  which are both long term  to refinance these borrowings at their respective maturity or repayment date 
we intend to pursue other sources of long term financing to refinance the borrowings  however  in the event other sources of long term financing are not available  we intend to use our revolving credit facilities 
we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt  which is approximately fixed and floating at december  in addition  we periodically enter into derivative transactions to secure the then current market interest rate in anticipation of senior debt issuances 
during  we entered into hedging agreements to secure the underlying treasury rates in anticipation of our senior note issuances 
we settled with the counterparties for approximately million  which was paid concurrently with related senior note issuances discussed above 
in  we elected to terminate several interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion prior to the scheduled maturities and received cash of approximately million which is comprised of million for the fair value of the swaps that were terminated and million of accrued but unpaid interest receivable from the counterparties to the interest rate swaps 
under the hedge method of accounting for these types of derivatives  the unamortized adjustment to long term debt for the terminated swaps remains classified as long term debt 
the proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in other assets or other liabilities within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
variable interest entities on june   two limited liability companies llcs were established to purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three waste to energy facilities that we operate under an agreement with the owner 
john hancock life insurance company hancock has a ownership in one of the llcs  the second llc is collectively owned by hancock and the cit group cit and we own the remaining interest in each 
hancock and cit made an initial investment of approximately million in the llcs 
the llcs used these proceeds to purchase the three waste to energy facilities that we operate and assumed the seller s indebtedness related to these facilities 
under the llc agreements  the llcs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following events i a written decision of all the members of the llcs to dissolve  ii december   iii the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under the delaware limited liability company act  or iv the llcs ceasing to own any interest in these waste to energy facilities 
income  losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based on their initial capital account balances until hancock and cit achieve targeted returns  thereafter  the amounts will be allocated to hancock and cit and to us 
we do not expect hancock and cit to achieve the targeted returns in or at any time during the initial base term of the lease 
we account for the underlying leases as operating leases 
we are required under certain circumstances to make capital contributions to the llcs in the amount of the difference between the stipulated loss amounts and termination values under the llc agreements to the extent they are different from the underlying lease agreements 
we believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of these circumstances is remote 
during  we had aggregate lease payments of approximately million 
under the llc agreements  if we exercise certain renewal options under the leases  we will be required to make capital contributions to the llcs for the difference  if any  between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal rents 
as of december   the remaining aggregate lease commitments related to these waste to energy facilities are million  which includes million in required capital contributions to the llc for the amount of the difference between bargain renewals and the fair value of the lease 
these minimum lease payments are included in the table of non cancelable rental obligations as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we are the manager of the llcs but there are significant limitations on the powers of the manager under the llc agreements 
accordingly  we account for our interest in the llcs under the equity method of accounting 
these investments had a carrying value of approximately million at both december  and december  if we were required to consolidate the llcs  we would record approximately million in assets  and million of debt as of december  the remaining balance that would be recorded would primarily be minority interest 
there would be no material net impact to our results of operations if we consolidated the llcs instead of accounting for them under the equity method 
accounting for stock options we account for our stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended  under which no compensation cost for stock options is recognized when granted with an exercise price equal to fair value 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 establishes accounting and annual disclosure requirements for options granted after using a fair value based method of accounting 
as of december    and  we had approximately million  million and million stock options and warrants outstanding  respectively 
the weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted during  and as determined under sfas no 
was  and  respectively 
the fair value of each common stock option granted to employees or directors during  and is estimated utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
black scholes is a formula that calculates an estimated value of stock options based on appreciation and interest rate assumptions and therefore  the fair value calculation of a stock option using black scholes is not necessarily indicative of the actual value of a stock option 
the following weighted average assumptions were used dividend yield of  risk free interest rates which vary for each grant and range from to  expected life of four to seven years for all grants  and stock price volatility primarily ranging from to 
the following schedule reflects the impact on net income and earnings per common share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee compensation in millions  except per share amounts 
years ended december  reported net income loss less compensation expense per sfas no 
 net of tax pro forma net income loss basic earnings per common share reported net income loss less compensation expense per sfas no 
 net of tax pro forma net income loss diluted earnings per common share reported net income loss less compensation expense per sfas no 
 net of tax pro forma net income loss seasonality and inflation our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months  which corresponds with our first and fourth quarters 
this is mostly because i the volume of construction and demolition waste is lower in the winter because there is less construction activity and ii the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate tends to decrease during the winter months 
we do not believe that inflation has  nor do we expect it to have  any material adverse effect on our results of operations in the near future 
recent developments in january  we announced that we had formed a new recycling entity  recycle america alliance  llc raa  a wholly owned subsidiary  in an effort to optimize the capacity and improve the profitability of our recycling operations 
in connection with the formation of raa  we transferred substantially all recycling assets and businesses of our other subsidiaries to raa 
raa s strategy includes combining its assets and operations with a number of key processors and marketers 
on january   the peltz group  the largest privately held recycler in the united states  contributed all of its assets to raa in exchange for an initial payment by raa of approximately million in cash and the issuance of approximately of the equity interest in raa 
in february  we announced that we will implement further restructuring to reorganize our operations into a smaller number of market areas in an effort to reduce overhead costs 
as part of the restructuring  there will be a net workforce reduction of about employees and contract workers 
we anticipate a charge of approximately million for this restructuring 
new accounting pronouncements and other accounting changes new accounting pronouncements sfas no

sfas no 
 which will primarily impact the accounting for our landfill operations  does not change the basic landfill accounting followed historically by us along with others in the waste industry 
in general  the waste industry has recognized expenses associated with both amortization of capitalized costs and future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  will continue to be followed upon adoption of sfas no 
 except as discussed below 
under the new rules  costs associated with future final capping activities that occur during the operating life of a landfill  which are currently recognized on an undiscounted basis over the operating life of the landfill as airspace is consumed  will be accounted for as an asset retirement obligation  on a discounted basis 
we expect to recognize landfill retirement obligations that relate to closure and post closure activities over the operating life of a landfill as landfill airspace is consumed and the obligation is incurred 
we expect to recognize our final capping obligations on a discrete basis for each expected future final capping event over the number of tons of waste that each final capping event is expected to cover 
these obligations will be initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value will be measured on a present value basis  using a credit adjusted  risk free rate  initially  which is higher than the risk free rate previously used for discounting closure and post closure obligations 
interest will be accreted on all landfill retirement obligations using the effective interest method 
landfill retirement costs arising from closure and post closure obligations  which will be capitalized as part of the landfill asset  will be amortized using our existing landfill accounting practices 
landfill retirement costs arising from final capping obligations  which will also be capitalized as part of the landfill asset  will be amortized on a units of consumption basis over the number of tons of waste that each final capping event covers

fin in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
it clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the objective of the initial measurement of the liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are effective for us on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december  we will record the fair value of future material guarantees  if any 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for current disclosure requirements related to our guarantee arrangements 
fin in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin 
fin requires that unconsolidated variable interest entities be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries 
a primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or residual benefits 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing variable interest entities in the periods beginning after june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on our existing variable interests 
we have yet to determine the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
other accounting changes repairs and maintenance through december   we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures at our waste to energy facilities and ipps

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates  certain commodity prices and certain equity prices 
from time to time  we and certain of our subsidiaries use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on a notional amount  with no multipliers or leverage 
as of december   all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions  with the exception of certain derivatives related to the fiber commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding terminated fiber agreements with enron north america corp 
enron 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate exposure 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations  which are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest rates to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations 
an instantaneous  one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings  nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
since a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
currency rate exposure 
from time to time  we and certain of our subsidiaries have used foreign currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany foreign currency denominated debt 
an instantaneous ten percent decrease in foreign exchange rates at december  would have no material impact to the company 
we had no foreign currency derivatives at december  commodities price exposure 
we market recycled waste paper products such as onp and occ from our material recovery facilities 
we enter into financial fiber swaps to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales 
under these swap agreements  we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time 
we also enter into fiber swap agreements for trading purposes with the objective of generating profits from changes in market prices of waste paper and other paper products 
we record changes in the fair value of these fiber swap agreements not designated as hedges immediately to earnings 
all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used and our risk exposure limits 
an instantaneous ten percent increase in occ and onp prices at december  would decrease the fair value of our hedges by approximately million 
this analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity sales positions that are being hedged 
an instantaneous ten percent increase in prices at december  on our derivatives entered into for trading purposes would have no material impact on us 
at december   all  except two  of our fiber agreements were with enron 
due to enron s financial situation  collectibility of the funds associated with these instruments was not probable at december  and therefore these instruments were estimated to have no fair value 
the derivatives with enron were subsequently terminated in early the net fair value of the two derivatives with counterparties other than enron at december  was not material 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments
