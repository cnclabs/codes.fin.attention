funds from operations and funds available for distribution ffo  which is a commonly used measurement of the operating performance of an equity reit  as defined by nareit  is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and provisions on asset impairments  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
since  nareit has clarified the definition of ffo to include non recurring events except for extraordinary items and the results of discontinued operations 
the company has adopted these clarifications as of january  and has presented ffo on a consistent basis for all periods presented 
management believes the presentation of ffo and fad are useful disclosures as general measures of its operating performance in the real estate industry  although the company s ffo and fad may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of operating performance for other reits 
additionally  we believe ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
however  ffo and fad do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
fad is defined as ffo less non revenue producing capital expenditures  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and straight line rent adjustments plus amortization of deferred financing costs and non cash compensation charges 
ffo  fad and cash flow information for each of the three years in the period ended december   are summarized in the following tables in s funds from operations unaudited income loss before distributions to preferred unitholders  minority interest of unitholders in operating partnership  and extraordinary item    less plus losses gains on sales of real estate and impairment charges and employee termination costs    depreciation and amortization related to real estate    depreciation and amortization related to joint ventures and equity method investments discontinued operations funds from operations    funds available for distribution unaudited funds from operations    capitalized expenditures  tenant improvements    leasing commissions    non cash compensation charges  amortization of deferred financing costs    straight line rent adjustments    funds available for distribution    cash flow information cash flow provided by operating activities    cash flow provided by investing activities   cash flow used in financing activities    net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents  includes of employee termination costs in inflation the company s leases generally require tenants to pay either their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance or pay of these costs directly for triple net leases as a result  the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses is reduced 
the company does not anticipate that inflation will have a significant impact on its operating results in the near future 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company has identified the policies below  which are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company assesses its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a respective asset that the company expects to hold and use may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect its evaluations 
estimates of fair value are based on quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are not available  the best information available in the circumstances  such as the present value of estimated expected future cash flows 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in addition  the company reports properties that have been disposed of or which are held for sale  for which the company will not have continuing involvement  as discontinued operations 
as real estate assets are acquired  the costs of these assets are allocated to the components of the property  including any intangible assets related to the leases acquired  based on the company s judgment and historical experience with similar assets 
these assumptions and estimates affect the amount of costs allocated to land  land improvements and the components of the building and accordingly depreciation expense and any gains or losses on the ultimate sale of these assets 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is derived from rental income under leases that are classified as operating leases 
revenue is recognized on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
if the rental income under the lease is in excess of one year in length  it is recognized using the straight line method under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term 
reimbursements from tenants for expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred by the company 
deferred rent revenue represents rent collected from tenants in advance  which is generally for periods not longer than one year 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when amounts are earned under the terms of the company s leases with its tenants 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence  but does not control these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as equity method investments  and subsequently adjusted for equity in income losses from equity method investments and cash contributions and distributions 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost capitalization expenditures directly or indirectly related to the acquisition or improvement of real estate  including interest and other costs capitalized on development projects and land being readied for development  are included in the cost of the related real estate and are stated at cost 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs related to the development of the property  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and other costs incurred during the period of development 
these costs are capitalized until the related asset is substantially complete and is placed in service 
our capitalization policy is in accordance with sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
income taxes and reit compliance the company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections through of the code 
in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust  the company must derive at least of gross income in any year from qualifying sources and must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least of the reit s taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis 
it is the company s intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the reit status 
as a reit  the company generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net income that is distributed currently to the stockholders 
as such  no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as a reit  the company still may be subject to certain state and local taxes on income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on any undistributed taxable income 
in addition  the company will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income  if any  from the activities conducted through our taxable reit subsidiary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its credit facility and other variable rate debt obligations as interest on these obligations is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the amount outstanding under the credit facility and other variable rate debt obligations represented approximately of debt outstanding as of december  the company also utilizes mortgage debt with fixed rates as a source of capital 
the weighted average interest rate and maturity for fixed rate debt was and years  respectively  at december  as these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
the following table summarizes the company s five year debt maturities at december   including debt of million related to assets held for sale and the weighted average interest rates associated with the maturing debt in each respective year  excluding the impact of any debt premiums which were initially recorded 
maturing debt in s      weighted average interest rate includes the credit facility which had an outstanding balance of million at december  and matures december  if the interest rate for the credit facility and other variable rate debt was basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
no fixed rate debt matures in due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates  the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
as of december   the company does not have any derivative investments related to interest rate management
