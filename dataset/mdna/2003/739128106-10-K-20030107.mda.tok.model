results of operations revenue and gross profit revenues increased to a record million in fiscal as compared to fiscal year revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of over fiscal revenues of million 
our electrical power products  which consist of the switchgear and bus duct segments  recorded revenues in fiscal of million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  one aspect of our revenue growth was due to new worldwide investments in oil gas production facilities 
furthermore  demand for additional electrical power generation capacities in the united states strengthened over the expansion realized in fiscal revenues in our process control systems segment were million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal for additional information related to our business segments  see note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
international revenues increased in fiscal following a decline in the previous two years 
revenues outside of the united states accounted for of consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  improved to in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
higher production volumes  improved operating efficiencies  along with the quality of our backlog have all contributed to the improvement in gross profit 
we continue to implement lean manufacturing initiatives to reduce costs and respond to the competitive markets that we serve 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including research and development expenditures  were million of revenues in fiscal compared to million of revenues and million of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
increases in operating expenses are largely due to the growth in business volumes during the same periods 
we have continued to invest in research activities 
research and development expenditures were million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
our research efforts are directed toward the discovery and development of new products and processes as well as improvements in existing products and processes 
interest income and expense net interest expense decreased to thousand in fiscal from thousand in fiscal due to lower levels of debt 
interest expense is related to our revolving credit facility and long term debt which is partially offset by interest income from short term investments 
fiscal resulted in net interest income of thousand 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily a result of higher state taxes and is also partly attributable to increases in non deductible expenses 
net earnings net earnings were million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year compared to million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  in fiscal years and  respectively 
growth in business volume and increased gross profits resulted in earnings improvement in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal we incurred additional costs on a major project in our process control systems segment which decreased earnings in the period 
liquidity and capital resources we have maintained a strong liquidity position 
working capital was million at october  compared to million at october  as of october   current assets exceeded current liabilities by nearly times and our debt to capitalization ratio was less than to cash and cash equivalents were million at october   an increase of over year end long term debt  including current maturities  totaled million at october  compared to million at october  in addition to our long term debt  we have a million revolving credit agreement expiring february as of october   there were no borrowings under this line of credit 
for further information regarding our debt  see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities provided million with the remainder of the increase related to net earnings adjusted for non cash costs such as depreciation and amortization 
during fiscal  operating activities used million primarily due to growth in working capital associated with higher production volumes 
investing activities cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment during fiscal increased to million  as compared to million in fiscal during  we completed a new facility in northlake  il for the manufacture of our isolated phase bus duct product line 
the expansion of our north canton  oh facility  which is used in the manufacture of our switchgear product lines  was also completed 
capital expenditures also supported process improvements throughout our manufacturing operations 
financing activities financing activities used million in fiscal approximately million was used for net repayments on our revolving line of credit and our long term debt 
other financing activities were limited to the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily from increases in long term debt 
outlook for fiscal due to the current economic environment and the outlook for the markets we serve  we anticipate consolidated revenues to decrease in by to 
our revenue growth in and was due to worldwide investments in oil and gas production facilities and electrical power generation capacities 
we anticipate new investments in oil and gas facilities to strengthen our export sales during the coming year 
however  additional investments in power generation facilities are expected to soften during for the fiscal year  we expect full year earnings from continuing operations to range between and per diluted share 
based on initial tests  we expect to record a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately thousand 
the impairment charge will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of november  we will continue to invest in our manufacturing capabilities and expect capital expenditures during fiscal year to range between million and million 
of this amount  approximately million will be needed to complete a project to increase our manufacturing capacity available for the manufacture of electrical power control modules 
these modules are provided to the oil and gas industry for use on offshore platforms 
this project was initiated during and will be completed by the middle of as a result of our internal operating efficiencies  cost containment  and low levels of debt  we anticipate that our cash position will continue to grow during we believe that working capital  borrowing capabilities  and funds generated from operations should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements  debt repayment and possible future acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policy has the greatest impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales upon transfer of title at the time of shipment or delivery according to terms of the contract  when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis primarily using the ratio of labor dollars or hours incurred to date to total estimated labor dollars or hours to measure the stage of completion 
contract costs include direct material and labor  and certain indirect costs 
revenues are not recognized on change orders until customer approval is obtained 
provisions for total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are estimable 
conditions such as changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated contract costs and profitability may result in revisions to original assumptions in the period in which the change becomes evident 
thus  actual results could differ from original assumptions  resulting in a different outcome for profits or losses than anticipated 
new accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

sfas no 
requires an initial impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill in the year of adoption 
we adopted sfas no 
on november  and have completed this initial impairment test 
based on this initial test  we expect to record a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately thousand in the first quarter of the impairment charge will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of november  at october   net goodwill was thousand and the annual amortization of such goodwill was thousand  which had an impact on earnings per diluted share of

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable and fixed rate debt and an interest rate hedge 
a increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of less than thousand 
we believe that changes in interest rates will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
for additional information regarding our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities  see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily through arranging compensation in us dollars 
risks associated with changes in commodity prices are primarily managed through utilizing contracts with suppliers 
risks related to foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are monitored and actions could be taken to hedge these risks in the future 
we believe that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices will not have a material near term effect on our future earnings and cash flows
