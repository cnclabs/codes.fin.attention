reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses cna surety s insurance subsidiaries employ generally accepted reserving approaches in establishing the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that give consideration to the inherent difficulty and variability in the estimation process 
in addition  cna surety utilizes an independent actuarial firm of national standing to conduct periodic reviews of loss reserving practices and annually obtains actuarial certification as to the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions used and the sufficiency of year end reserves for each of its principal insurance subsidiaries 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes  on an undiscounted basis  estimates of a the ultimate settlement value of reported claims  b incurred but not reported ibnr claims  c future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims and d claim recoveries  exclusive of reinsurance recoveries which are reported as an asset 
these estimates are determined based on the company s and surety industry loss experience as well as consideration of current trends and conditions 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate and there is the potential that actual future loss payments will differ significantly from initial estimates 
the methods of determining such estimates and the resulting estimated liability are regularly reviewed and updated 
changes in the estimated liability are reflected in operating income in the period in which such changes are determined to be needed 
a table is included in note  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  that presents the activity in the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the company and is incorporated herein by reference 
this table highlights the impact of revisions to the estimated liability established in prior years 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the consolidated loss reserves reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and the reserves reported to state insurance regulatory authorities in accordance with statutory accounting principles sap for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net reserves at end of year  gaap basis  ceded reinsurance  net of salvage and subrogation  gross reserves at end of year  gaap basis  estimated reinsurance recoverable netted against gross reserves for sap  net reserves at end of year  sap basis  the loss reserve development table below illustrates the change over time of reserves established for the company s estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses at the end of various calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section shows re estimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of management s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest re estimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether or not the original reserve was adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the loss reserve development table is cumulative as of each december  and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years 
the loss reserve development table reflects  on a pro forma basis  the reserves of the ccc surety operations and capsure since and cic since its acquisition in may of such historical development is not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would have occurred under the ownership and management of cna surety or of future operating results

the company maintains an experienced and dedicated staff of in house claim specialists 
claim handling is performed in chicago 
the disposition of claims and other claim related activity is done in accordance with established policies  procedures and expense controls designed to minimize loss costs and maximize salvage and subrogation recoveries 
indemnity and subrogation rights exist on a significant portion of the business written  enabling the company to pursue loss recovery from the principal 
environmental claims the company does not typically bond contractors that specialize in hazardous environmental remediation work 
the company does however bond several accounts that have incidental environmental exposure with respect to which the company provides bonding programs 
in the commercial surety market  the company provides bonds to large corporations that are in the business of mining various minerals and are obligated to post reclamation bonds that guarantee that property which was disturbed during mining is returned to an acceptable condition when the mining is completed 
the company also provides court and other surety bonds for large corporations wherein the underlying action involves environmental related issues 
while no environmental responsibility is overtly provided by commercial or contract bonds  some risk of environmental exposure may exist if the surety were to assume certain rights in the completion of a defaulted project or through salvage recovery 
the company estimates its net case incurred losses on known claims of this nature to be approximately million as of december  regulation the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they transact business under statutes which delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance regulators 
in general  an insurer s state of domicile has principal responsibility for such regulation which is designed generally to protect policyholders rather than investors and relates to matters such as the standards of solvency which must be maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the examination of the affairs of insurance companies  including periodic financial and market conduct examinations  the filing of annual and other reports  prepared on a statutory basis  on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
licensed or admitted insurers generally must file with the insurance regulators of such states  or have filed on its behalf  the premium rates and bond and policy forms used within each state 
in some states  approval of such rates and forms must be received from the insurance regulators in advance of their use 
western surety is domiciled in south dakota and licensed in all states and the district of columbia and puerto rico 
sbca is domiciled in south dakota and licensed in states and the district of columbia 
usa is domiciled in texas and licensed in states and the district of columbia 
insurance regulations generally also require registration and periodic disclosure of certain information concerning ownership  financial condition  capital structure  general business operations and any material transactions or agreements by or among affiliates 
such regulation also typically restricts the ability of any one person to acquire or more  either directly or indirectly  of a company s stock without prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authority 
in addition  dividends and other distributions to stockholders generally may be paid only out of unreserved and unrestricted statutory earned surplus 
such distributions may be subject to prior regulatory approval  including a review of the implications on risk based capital requirements

the states in which cna surety s insurance subsidiaries conduct business required adoption of codification for the preparation of statutory financial statements effective january  the adoption of codification increased the company s statutory capital and surplus as of january  by approximately million primarily due to recording of deferred tax assets and the recognition of anticipated salvage and subrogation 
cna surety s insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic financial and market conduct examinations

the regulation in question was subsequently amended to exclude surety products which eliminated any non compliance by the company 
the texas department of insurance the texas department conducted its last examination of usa s financial matters as of december  there were no significant issues noted which required corrective action by usa 
in  the south dakota department and the texas department completed fieldwork for their respective financial examinations of western surety and usa  respectively  for the five year period ended december  the company is currently awaiting the final financial examination reports from both the south dakota department and the texas department 
certain states in which cna surety s insurance subsidiaries conduct their business require insurers to join a guaranty association 
guaranty associations provide protection to policyholders of insurers licensed in such states against the insolvency of those insurers 
in order to provide the associations with funds to pay certain claims under policies issued by insolvent insurers  the guaranty associations charge members assessments based on the amount of direct premiums written in that state 
such assessments were not material to cna surety s results of operations in western surety  sbca and usa qualify as acceptable surety companies for federal and other public works project bonds pursuant to us department of treasury regulations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of cna surety corporation cna surety or the company and its subsidiaries operating results  liquidity and capital resources  and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of cna surety and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies management believes the most significant accounting policies and related disclosures for purposes of understanding the company s results of operations and financial condition pertain to investments  deferred acquisition costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance 
the company s accounting policies related to reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and related estimates of reinsurance recoverables  are particularly critical to an assessment of the company s financial results 
these areas are highly subjective and require management s most complex judgments because of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
for these reasons  disclosure on these topics is contained herein and in note  significant accounting policies  and notes and  reinsurance and reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of the consolidated financial statements 
investments management believes the company has the ability to hold all fixed income securities to maturity 
however  the company may dispose of securities prior to their scheduled maturity due to changes in interest rates  prepayments  tax and credit considerations  liquidity or regulatory capital requirements  or other similar factors 
as a result  the company considers all of its fixed income securities bonds and redeemable preferred stocks and equity securities as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of deferred income taxes  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
cash flows from purchases  sales and maturities are reported gross in the investing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the amortized cost of fixed income securities is determined based on cost and the cumulative effect of amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion are included in investment income 
for mortgage backed and certain asset backed securities  the company recognizes income using the effective yield method based on estimated cash flows 
all securities transactions are recorded on the trade date 
investment gains or losses realized on the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
investments with an other than temporary decline in value are written down to fair value  resulting in losses that are included in realized investment gains and losses 
short term investments which generally include us treasury bills  corporate notes  money market funds and investment grade commercial paper equivalents  are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses which vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of business  net of reinsurance commissions  are deferred and amortized as a charge to income as the related premiums are earned 
anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs 
goodwill and other intangible assets cna surety s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill and identified intangibles of approximately million 
these amounts represent goodwill and identified intangibles arising from the acquisition of capsure holdings corp 
capsure 
prior to  goodwill from this acquisition was generally amortized as a charge to earnings over periods not exceeding years 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
which was adopted by cna surety as of january   periodic amortization ceased  in accordance with an impairment only accounting model 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of cna surety s reporting units 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
there are several methods of estimating fair value  including market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value  then individual assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value 
the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill 
the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value of goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance cna surety accrues liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under its surety and property and casualty insurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
as of any balance sheet date  all claims have not yet been reported and some claims may not be reported for many years 
as a result  the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for incurred but not reported claims 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits and certain claim liabilities may take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
the company uses a variety of techniques to establish the liabilities for unpaid claims recorded at the balance sheet date 
while techniques may vary  each employs significant judgments and assumptions 
techniques may involve detailed statistical analysis of past claim reporting  settlement activity  salvage and subrogation activity  claim frequency and severity data when sufficient information exists to lend statistical credibility to the analysis 
the analysis may be based upon internal loss experience or industry experience 
techniques may vary depending on the type of claim being estimated 
liabilities may also reflect implicit or explicit assumptions regarding the potential effects of future economic and social inflation  judicial decisions  law changes  and recent trends in such factors 
receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and  therefore  are also subject to uncertainty 
in addition to the factors cited above  estimates of reinsurance recoveries may prove uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders 
cna surety s consolidated balance sheet includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and reinsurance receivables of million at december  due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing these amounts  the actual ultimate claims amounts will differ from the currently recorded amounts 
an incremental percentage change in estimates of this magnitude could result in a material effect on reported earnings 
for example  a increase in the december  net estimate for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses would produce approximately a million charge to pre tax earnings 
future effects from changes in these estimates will be recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period such changes are determined to be needed

gross written premiums for commercial surety increased  or million  for the year ended december  reflecting continued volume growth of small commercial products and improving rates on large commercial bonds partially offset by the impacts of the company s ongoing efforts to reduce aggregate exposures on large commercial accounts 
the estimated impact of the company s exposure reduction efforts to date represents approximately million in annual premium  assuming an average rate per  of bond exposure of  or basis points and approximately billion of bond exposure 
fidelity and other products increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due primarily to an increase in fidelity business partially offset by the discontinuance of the company s agents e o business 
gross written premiums for the year ended december  increased  or million  for the year ended december  over the comparable period in effective january   the company began recording written premium on the effective date of the bond  rather than recording on the date the bond is processed processed premium 
this change did not impact the recognition of net earned premium but reduced gross written premiums by million 
in addition  gross written premiums reflect a million reduction due to the discontinuance of the cna reinsurance company  limited london cna re  an affiliate of ccc  assumed international credit and surety business in core direct gross processed premiums gross processed premiums  excluding international reinsurance business assumed from cna re increased to million

gross written premiums for core direct commercial surety increased  or million  primarily due to favorable trends in the commercial segment including increased small transactional business and beneficial pricing actions within the large commercial segment offset by a million reduction due to the recording change on written premium 
fidelity and other products increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  net written premiums for the years ended december   and are shown in the table below dollars in thousands years ended december  contract    commercial    fidelity and other    for the year ended december  net written premiums decreased to million as compared to the same period in  reflecting the aforementioned gross production variances  the effects of higher reinsurance costs and the company s efforts to reduce large commercial bond exposures

the reinsurance costs reflected in ceded premiums are based upon reinsurers loss experience under the company s surety excess of loss reinsurance contract 
due primarily to increased large losses reported to the company s excess of loss reinsurers  ceded written premiums increased million to million in net written premiums increased  or million  for the contract surety business 
commercial surety net written premiums  excluding international reinsurance business assumed  increased  or million  in the fidelity and other products increased  or million  for the year ended december  excess of loss reinsurance since the second half of calendar year  the company has experienced an increase in claim severity and frequency in the most recent accident years 
the increase in claim severity in more recent accident years has generally resulted in higher gross accident year loss ratios and greater losses ceded to reinsurers under the company s million per principal excess of loss reinsurance contract in place in  as well as changes in the company s reinsurance program 
cna surety is paying higher costs for reinsurance as a result of this loss experience 
the company s reinsurance program is predominantly comprised of excess of loss reinsurance contracts that limit the company s retention on a per principal basis 
the company s reinsurance coverage is provided by third party reinsurers and related parties 
third party reinsurance compared to third party reinsurance the company s ceded reinsurance program changed significantly in as compared to the material differences between the excess of loss reinsurance program excess of loss treaty and the company s program are as follows 
the annual aggregate coverage decreased from million in to million in with a sub limit of million for large commercial accounts 
the minimum annual premium for the excess of loss treaty is million compared to million of reinsurance premiums paid in the excess of loss treaty provides the company with coverage on a per principal basis of of million excess of million retained by the company 
in addition  ccc is providing reinsurance coverage the quota share agreement to the company for of any losses between million and million with respect to single large surety bonds written effective january  through december  ccc receives of the written premium the company received in exchange for the coverage provided 
in addition  the terms of the excess of loss treaty required a special acceptance process for certain larger contract accounts in force at the inception date of the treaty 
the reinsurers conducted an underwriting file review and approval process for these risks that would otherwise be excluded 
this file review process resulted in one large national contract principal being excluded from the excess of loss treaty 
in addition  the treaty excludes certain classes of business relating to two other principals 
the company no longer writes these classes but has exposures that are in run off 
should the company incur a loss on these excluded principals  the company would be subject to a maximum retention of million per principal 
the higher net retention of million per principal together with other changes in reinsurance coverage associated with the excess of loss reinsurance treaty and the extended discovery and related provisions of the excess of loss reinsurance contract in place for may increase the variability of the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
moreover  as stated above  if cna surety suffered any losses arising from bonds issued to the large national contractor  cna surety would retain the first million per principal under its various excess of loss reinsurance contracts 
in december and january  cnaf provided loans in an aggregate amount of approximately million to the large national contractor that undertakes projects for the construction of government and private facilities 
cna surety has provided significant surety bond protection for this contractor s projects through surety bonds underwritten by ccc or its affiliates 
the loans were provided by cnaf to help the contractor meet its liquidity needs 
the loans are evidenced by demand notes and  until replaced by the credit facility described below  accrue interest at 
the owners of the contractor have pledged to cnaf substantially all the assets of the contractor as collateral for these loans 
in march  cnaf entered into an agreement to provide a credit facility with the contractor 
the closing of this agreement is subject to the execution of certain agreements and the provision to cnaf of specified security interests in addition to those already provided 
under this credit facility  cnaf would be obligated to provide up to million of loans to the contractor and certain of its subsidiaries  including a refinancing of the already advanced million described above 
the credit facility and all loans thereunder would mature in march advances under the credit facility  including the already funded million  would bear interest at the prime rate plus  with of the interest due monthly and the remainder deferred until the credit facility matures 
loews corporation and cnaf have entered into a participation agreement  pursuant to which loews has agreed to purchase a one third participation share in the new credit facility  on a dollar for dollar basis  up to a maximum of million 
although loews does not have rights against the contractor directly under the participation agreement  it shares recoveries and fees under the facility on a proportional basis with cnaf 
in march  cnaf also purchased approximately million principal amount of the contractor s outstanding bank debt for million 
under the new credit facility  cnaf agreed to sell the bank debt to the contractor for million  with million of the purchase price being funded under the new credit facility and million from amounts loaned to the contractor by its shareholders 
under its purchase agreement with the banks  cnaf is also required to reimburse the banks for any draws upon approximately million in outstanding letters of credit issued by the banks for the contractor s benefit that expire between may and august of any cnaf reimbursements for draws upon the banks letters of credit will become obligations of the contractor to cnaf as draws upon the credit facility 
the contractor has initiated a restructuring plan that is intended to reduce costs and improve cash flow  and a chief restructuring officer has been appointed to manage execution of the plan 
cna surety intends to continue to provide surety bonds on behalf of the contractor during this restructuring period  subject to the contractor s initial and ongoing compliance with cna surety s underwriting standards 
indemnification and subrogation rights  including rights to contract proceeds on construction projects in the event of default  reduce cna surety s exposure to loss 
if the contractor does not perform its contractual obligations underlying all of the company s surety bonds  the company estimates that possible losses  net of indemnification and subrogation recoveries  but before recoveries under reinsurance contracts  could be up to million 
however  the related party reinsurance treaties discussed below should limit the company s per principal exposure to approximately million 
while cna surety believes that the contractor s restructuring efforts will be successful and provide sufficient cash flow for its operations  the contractor s failure to achieve its restructuring plan could have a material adverse effect on cna surety s future results of operations  cash flows and capital resources 
in connection with the changes in the company s reinsurance program  cna surety purchased extended discovery coverage  available under the excess of loss reinsurance coverage in place in  at a cost of approximately million 
this covers losses on surety bonds written prior to january  and discovered in the two years after january  the limit of this extended discovery coverage is the unused portion of the annual aggregate limit of million under the excess of loss treaty 
this limit has two layers comprised of a million aggregate limit for per principal losses between million and million and million aggregate for per principal losses between million and million 
based upon the company s settlement of its exposure to enron and its current claim estimates of other discovered losses  the company estimates that as of december  the first layer of the annual aggregate has been exhausted and approximately million of limit remains under the second layer to cover adverse development on losses discovered prior to december  as well as newly discovered losses in the extended discovery period 
it is possible that these remaining annual aggregate limits could be insufficient to fully cover all adverse development that could occur on losses discovered prior to december  or any newly discovered losses under the extended discovery provisions 
the unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties could have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
third party reinsurance compared to third party reinsurance effective january   cna surety entered into a new excess of loss treaty excess of loss treaty with a group of third party reinsurers that reduced its net retention per principal on new bonds to million with a co participation in the million layer of third party reinsurance coverage above the company s retention 
this new excess of loss treaty replaces the million excess of million per principal coverage 
the material differences between the new excess of loss reinsurance program and the company s excess of loss treaty are as follows 
the annual aggregate coverage increases from million in to million in the minimum annual premium for the excess of loss treaty is million compared to million of reinsurance premiums paid in the excess of loss treaty provides the company with coverage on a per principal basis of of million excess of million retained by the company 
the contract also includes similar special acceptance provisions for larger contract accounts contained in the excess of loss treaty 
in addition to the one large contract principal and the two commercial principals excluded based upon class of business in  the company s reinsurers have initially excluded three other contract principals from the excess of loss treaty 
the three additional contract principals are in the process of completing asset sales and other reorganization efforts that management believes will result in the reinsurers acceptance of the accounts in the treaty

the stop loss contract protected the insurance subsidiaries from adverse loss experience on certain business underwritten after the merger date 
the stop loss contract between the insurance subsidiaries and ccc limited the insurance subsidiaries prospective net loss ratios with respect to certain accounts and lines of insured business for three full accident years following the merger date 
in the event the insurance subsidiaries accident year net loss ratio exceeds in any of through on certain insured accounts the loss ratio cap  the stop loss contract requires ccc at the end of each calendar quarter following the merger date  to pay to the insurance subsidiaries a dollar amount equal to i the amount  if any  by which their actual accident year net loss ratio exceeds the applicable loss ratio cap  multiplied by ii the applicable net earned premiums 
in consideration for the coverage provided by the stop loss contract  the insurance subsidiaries paid to ccc an annual premium of  the cna surety insurance subsidiaries have paid ccc all required annual premiums

the two excess of loss contracts collectively provided coverage for losses discovered on surety bonds in force as of the merger date and for losses discovered on new and renewal business written during the term of the excess of loss contracts 
both excess of loss contracts commenced following the merger date and continued until september  the discovery period for losses covered by the excess of loss contracts extends until september  effective october   the company secured replacement excess of loss protection from ccc for per principal losses that exceed million in two parts a million excess of million and b million excess of million 
this excess of loss protection is primarily necessary to support contract surety accounts with bonded backlogs or work in process in excess of million 
the company s goal is to generally limit support to large commercial surety accounts to million 
in addition to the foregoing structural changes in its high layer excess of loss reinsurance programs  the cost for these protections increased significantly as compared to the cost of the previous two excess of loss contracts 
the million excess of million contract is for a three year term beginning october  and provides annual aggregate coverage of million and million aggregate coverage for the entire three year term 
the company will pay ccc annual reinsurance premiums of million in year one and million in years two and three  payable quarterly

underwriting income underwriting income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to estimated net incurred losses of million related to the september  bankruptcy filing of a national trucking concern and higher current accident year reserving 
in addition  the company recorded net unfavorable loss reserve development for prior accident years of million for the year ended december  compared to million net unfavorable reserve development in underwriting results also reflect the impact of increased reinsurance costs on net earned premium partially offset by reduced acquisition and underwriting expenses 
underwriting income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to adverse claim trends in the large commercial segment  including approximately million of net incurred losses associated with the company s exposure to enron corporation 
this increased claim severity caused the company to earn lower underwriting profits because of increased estimates of gross and net incurred losses for more recent accident years 
in addition  these trends adversely impacted the cost and availability of reinsurance 
as the foregoing underwriting results indicate  the company s business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties associated with the current economic environment and corporate credit conditions 
in response to these risks and uncertainties  the company has enacted various exposure management initiatives  particularly to reduce its risks on large commercial accounts 
as the following table depicts  the company has reduced its exposure  before the effects of reinsurance  by in on large commercial accounts  which are defined as accounts with exposures in excess of million number of accounts as of total exposure december  as of december  commercial account exposure reduction dollars in billions million and larger to million to million to million total with respect to contract surety  the company s portfolio is predominantly comprised of contractors with work programs of less than million 
work program is the estimated contract value of uncompleted bonded and unbonded work 
bonded backlog is a measure of the company s exposure in the event of default before indemnification  salvage and subrogation recoveries

for the first half of  the company used an initial accident year net loss ratio of percent to reserve for its medium to large commercial and contract branch business compared to percent when the per principal retention was million 
this business represents about of the company s gross premiums 
the occurrence of the million bankruptcy related loss in the third quarter of significantly increased the estimated branch contract and commercial net accident year loss ratio for the nine months ended september  due to the occurrence of this loss and other adverse loss trends  together with the uncertain outlook for the economy and credit markets  the company raised its expected baseline accident year net loss ratio on the branch contract and commercial business to percent for the fourth quarter from the initial accident year net loss ratio of percent

gross incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended december  reflect million for this exposure 
on january   cna surety settled litigation brought by jp morgan chase co 
chase in connection with three surety bonds issued on behalf of enron corporation subsidiaries 
the penal sums of the three bonds totaled approximately million 
although the company believed it had valid defenses to the litigation  based on the uncertainty and risk of an adverse jury verdict  pursuant to the settlement agreement  the company paid chase approximately million and assigned its recovery rights in the enron bankruptcy to chase in exchange for a full release of its obligations under the bonds 
the company has no other exposure related to the enron corporation 
cna surety s net loss related to the settlement  after anticipated recoveries under excess of loss reinsurance treaties  was previously fully reserved 
immediately upon execution of the settlement documents  the company sent written notice for reimbursement to its reinsurers 
a number of those reinsurers have requested a variety of documents and reserved their rights before making a decision concerning coverage of the settlement under the reinsurance treaties 
management believes that the reinsurers have no valid defense under the reinsurance treaties to avoid payment  and that the company will fully recover all reinsurance recoverables recorded related to this settlement 
as such  the company has provided no valuation allowance with respect to these reinsurance recoverables as of december  the surety business assumed from ccc and cic is subject to an aggregate stop loss reinsurance contract between ccc and the company that limits the company s accident year net loss ratio on this business to for accident years october  to december    and the company recorded estimated reinsurance recoveries from ccc of million in  million in and million in under this contract

as an insurance holding company  cna surety is dependent upon dividends and other permitted payments from its insurance subsidiaries to pay operating expenses  meet debt service requirements  as well as to pay cash dividends 
the payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiaries is subject to varying degrees of supervision by the insurance regulatory authorities in south dakota and texas 
in south dakota  where western surety and sbca are domiciled  insurance companies may only pay dividends from earned surplus excluding surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets 
in texas  where usa is domiciled  an insurance company may only declare or pay dividends to stockholders from the insurer s earned surplus 
the insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval only if such dividend or distribution together with dividends or distributions made within the preceding month period is less than  as of the end of the immediately preceding year  the greater of i of the insurer s surplus to policyholders or ii statutory net income 
in south dakota  net income includes net realized capital gains in an amount not to exceed of net unrealized capital gains 
all dividends must be reported to the appropriate insurance department prior to payment 
the dividends that may be paid without prior regulatory approval are determined by formulas established by the applicable insurance regulations  as described above

reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses cna surety s insurance subsidiaries employ generally accepted reserving approaches in establishing the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that give consideration to the inherent difficulty and variability in the estimation process 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes  on an undiscounted basis  estimates of a the ultimate settlement value of reported claims  b incurred but not reported ibnr claims  c future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims and d claim recoveries  exclusive of reinsurance recoveries which are reported as an asset 
these estimates are determined based on the company s and surety industry loss experience as well as consideration of current trends and conditions 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate and there is the potential that actual future loss payments will differ significantly from initial estimates 
the methods of determining such estimates and the resulting estimated liability are regularly reviewed and updated 
changes in the estimated liability are reflected in operating income in the period in which such changes are determined to be needed 
the company s estimated liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are recorded at management s best estimate which is based on various statistical reviews and analyses performed by the company and management s judgment as to the responsiveness of these reviews and analyses to the factors affecting the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
management considers factors such as changes in inflation  changes in claim handling and case reserving  changes in underwriting and pricing  changes in reinsurance programs  the company s net retained liability and changes in the legal environment 
cna surety utilizes an independent actuarial firm of national standing to conduct periodic reviews of claim procedures and loss reserving practices  and annually obtains actuarial certification as to the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions used and the sufficiency of year end reserves for each of its principal insurance subsidiaries 
in connection with this actuarial certification  the company s independent actuarial firm provides management with additional reports and analysis and its independent judgments regarding loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates for management s review

impact of adopting accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
and no 
entitled business combinations sfas no 
and goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 respectively 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations subsequent to june  and specifies criteria for recognizing intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the company will adopt this standard for any future business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
any impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount of an intangible asset over its fair value would be recognized as a charge to operations 
intangible assets with definite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  during  the company completed its initial goodwill impairment testing and an annual goodwill impairment testing as of october  whereby no impairment was indicated 
in the fourth quarter of  the company again tested for goodwill impairment 
based upon the company s analysis supported by an outside valuation study  the company concluded that there was no impairment 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets  the company calculated its estimated fair value using the present value of estimated expected future cash flows 
the resulting estimated fair value was then compared to the net book value  including goodwill 
if the net book value exceeded the estimated fair value  the company would have measured the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied estimated fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized 
this impairment test will be performed annually and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there is a possible impairment of goodwill 
the company believes the methodology it uses in testing impairment of goodwill provides a reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge is required 
the adoption of this standard eliminated the company s amortization of goodwill and intangibles as of december  and therefore  increased the company s reported net income in by million  or per share as compared to prior years 
if the provisions of this standard were applied to prior periods  net income for the year ended december  and would have been million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk cna surety s investment portfolio is subject to economic losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of its financial instruments  or market risk 
interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position due to its significant level of investments in fixed income securities 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of the company s fixed income portfolio 
the fair value of these interest rate sensitive instruments may also be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative value of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  income tax considerations and general market conditions 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk primarily through an asset liability matching strategy 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of its insurance and other liabilities 
the targeted effective duration of the company s investment portfolio is approximately years  consistent with the expected duration of its insurance and other liabilities 
the tables below summarize the estimated effects of certain hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly across each investment category 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates selected reflect the company s expectations of the reasonably possible best or worst case scenarios over a one year period 
the hypothetical fair values are based upon the same prepayment assumptions that were utilized in computing fair values as of december  significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and therefore actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table
