item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview integral systems  inc builds satellite ground systems for command and control  integration and test  data processing  and simulation 
since its inception in  the company has provided ground systems for over different satellite missions for communications  science  meteorology  and earth resource applications 
the company has an established domestic and international customer base that includes government and commercial satellite operators  spacecraft and payload manufacturers  and aerospace systems integrators 
the company has developed innovative software products that reduce the cost and minimize the development risk associated with traditional custom built systems 
the company believes that it was the first to offer a comprehensive cots commercial off the shelf software product line for command and control 
as a systems integrator  the company leverages these products to provide turnkey satellite control facilities that can operate multiple satellites from any manufacturer 
these systems offer significant cost savings for customers that have traditionally purchased a separate custom control center for each of their satellites 
through its wholly owned subsidiary sat  acquired in august  the company also offers turnkey systems and software for satellite and terrestrial communications signal monitoring 
in march  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  isi europe  with headquarters in toulouse  france 
isi europe serves as the focal point for the support of all of integral s european business 
on january   the company acquired newpoint 
newpoint provides equipment monitoring and control software to satellite operators and the telecommunications industry 

table of contents in october  the company acquired rt logic 
rt logic manufactures satellite communications equipment and systems  principally for military applications 
this equipment is used in satellite tracking stations  control centers  spacecraft factories  and range facilities 
in july  the company acquired the intellectual property rights  inventory and certain other assets of the former jackson tull satellite ground systems division 
the acquisition is an extension of the satellite ground systems business segment and enables the company to be a turn key provider of full motion antennas and rf systems used for tracking low earth orbiting satellites and launch vehicles as well as aeronautical telemetry range operations

newpoint revenue for fiscal year was only for an eight month period  as the company did not acquire this entity until january  rt logic was acquired subsequent to september   so the company reported no revenue for the space communication systems segment for fiscal year the revenue generated by rt logic for fiscal year was the highest annual revenue in that subsidiary s history 
cost of revenue gross margin the company computes gross margin by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue 
included in cost of revenue are direct labor expenses  overhead charges associated with the company s direct labor base and other costs that can be directly related to specific contract cost objectives  such as travel  consultants  equipment  subcontracts and other direct costs 
gross margins on contract revenues vary depending on the type of product or service provided 
generally  license revenues related to the sale of the company s cots products have the greatest gross margins because of the minimal associated marginal costs to produce 
by contrast  gross margins rates for equipment and subcontract pass throughs seldom exceed 
engineering service gross margins typically range between and 
these definitions and ratios generally apply across all segments

monitoring control newpoint space communication systems rt logic  n a  intersegment total gross margin cost of revenue increases were disproportionately greater than the revenue increases for the company s satellite ground systems segment during the periods compared  resulting in a lower gross margin percentage for this segment for the current period compared to last fiscal year compared to 
the lower gross margin percentage for the segment is primarily attributable to two factors overruns and reserves on a three fixed price contracts with noaa amounting to approximately  in the current year  and a higher percentage of lower margin equipment and subcontract pass through revenue in the segment s revenue mix this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year 
equipment and subcontract pass through revenue comprised of revenue for the satellite ground systems segment during the fiscal year compared to of revenue last fiscal year 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue at sat increased to from while gross margin as a percentage of revenue at newpoint increased to from on a year to year basis 
the increased percentage for both segments is due to the effects of cost cutting and the elimination of overruns experienced during the prior fiscal year 
rt logic was acquired subsequent to september   so the company reported no cost of revenue or gross margin for the space communication systems segment for fiscal year rt logic s gross margin for fiscal year is the highest in that subsidiary s history

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while the company currently does not have significant european operations  its customer base is expanding outside the us and therefore certain contracts now and in the future will likely be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as foreign currency exchange rates for contracts denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to mitigate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the company may hedge this risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts 
as of september   virtually all of the company s contracts were denominated in us dollars 
three contracts were denominated in euros that were hedged 
as the company enters into new foreign currency based contracts in the future  it may employ similar hedging contracts
