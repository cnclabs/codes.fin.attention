item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes  expressed in united states dollars and prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which generally conform with those principles established in the united states  except as explained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements based on our current expectations 
these forward looking statements entail various risks and uncertainties  as discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward looking statements 
reference is also made to cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements above 
nature of business we are a leading producer of nickel  a hard  malleable metal which  given its properties and wide range of applications  can be found in thousands of products 
we are also an important producer of copper  precious metals and cobalt and a major producer of value added specialty nickel products 
our principal mines and processing operations are located in the sudbury area of ontario  the thompson area of manitoba and  through a subsidiary in which we have an equity interest of per cent  pt inco  on the island of sulawesi  indonesia 
we have additional wholly owned metals refineries at port colborne  ontario and in the united kingdom at clydach  wales and acton  england 
we also have interests in nickel refining capacity in japan  through contractual arrangements with inco tnc limited  in which we have an equity interest of per cent  in taiwan  through taiwan nickel refining corporation  in which we have an equity interest of per cent  and in south korea  through korea nickel company  in which we have an equity interest of per cent 
we also have a per cent equity interest in jinco nonferrous metals co  ltd  a company that produces nickel salts for plating and other applications at a plant near shanghai in china 
our business operations consist of our finished products segment  which comprises the mining and processing operations in ontario and manitoba  the refining operations in the united kingdom and interests in the refining operations in japan and other asian countries  referred to above  and intermediates segment  which comprises pt inco s mining and processing operations in indonesia  where nickel in matte  an intermediate product  is produced and sold primarily into the japanese market 
in addition  we are currently developing two major new or so called greenfield projects  our per cent owned goro nickel cobalt project in new caledonia and our wholly owned voisey s bay nickel copper cobalt project in the province of newfoundland and labrador  as described under risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties and outlook below 
as noted below under goro project suspension costs  in early december we initiated a comprehensive review of the goro project 
in recent years  sales of our primary metals products were concentrated in the united states  europe  japan  elsewhere in asia  and canada  with about per cent of our revenues from nickel derived from sales of our nickel products in asia 
nickel market overview the nickel industry is highly competitive in all aspects  including the exploration for  and the development of  new sources of supply  the acquisition of deposits  and the processing  distribution and marketing of nickel products 
the level of production and export of primary nickel and secondary or nickel containing scrap material from russia as well as other sources of such scrap  together with the continuing relatively limited level of domestic consumption of nickel in russia since the break up of the former soviet union  has had  and could continue to have  a significant impact on the nickel industry s supply demand balance 
the price of nickel has represented  and is currently expected to continue to represent  the principal determinant of our profitability and cash flow from operations 
accordingly  our financial performance has been  and is expected to continue to be  closely linked to the price of nickel and  to a lesser extent  the price of copper and other primary metals produced by us 
we have seen  and expect to continue to see  significant volatility in the price of nickel based upon changes in the supply demand balance and other related factors which can affect such prices 
since we sell our nickel products in all major geographical markets  the realized prices for our primary nickel and other primary metals products are influenced by both global and regional supply demand factors and by the availability and prices of secondary or metal containing scrap material  including nickel containing scrap generated by the stainless steel industry  and other substitute or competing commodity products for the primary nickel and other metals products produced by us 
the nickel market strengthened in as demand  on a western world plus china basis  grew by per cent during the year to  tonnes despite continued weakness in certain large segments of the global economy 
during  growth in industrial production continued in china and rebounded in most major asian economies  excluding japan  while economic recovery in the united states  europe and japan struggled to take hold 
the growth in nickel demand was primarily concentrated in the stainless steel sector  the largest end use of primary nickel 
nickel demand growth in this sector increased by almost per cent  driven by an increase in stainless steel production and a decline in the proportion or ratio of nickel containing stainless steel scrap relative to primary nickel the nickel which we produce to the total nickel consumed by stainless steel producers 
stainless steel production increased by per cent to approximately million tonnes  with growth experienced in all major industrial countries of the world except japan where production declined slightly 
this production growth was particularly strong in the united states  up per cent  driven by the opening of a new  tonne per year stainless steel production facility in kentucky and higher production at existing facilities elsewhere in the united states  and in taiwan  where production increased by per cent as existing facilities operated at near capacity levels 
growth in primary nickel supply continued in as several relatively new or greenfield projects located in south america and australia continued to increase production to their expected design capacities 
primary nickel production on a western world plus china basis increased by  tonnes to  tonnes in overall primary nickel supply on a western world plus china basis increased to  tonnes excluding  tonnes of nickel understood to have been stockpiled in russia and then exported in as collateral for a loan made to a russian nickel producer and  accordingly  not made available to the market 
russian exports excluding the  tonnes of nickel referred to above increased compared with as it is believed that russian producers exported all of their available production in rather than stockpiling a portion of their production 
actual russian production is believed to have declined in the overall increase in nickel supply in came principally from colombia and venezuela  where new or greenfield projects were completing their ramp up to their design capacities  australia  where production increased from the continued ramp up of one project and higher production from certain existing producers  and japan  where production in the form of ferronickel rebounded to near capacity levels 
the strong growth in nickel demand during largely offset the growth in nickel production  resulting in an essentially balanced market for as it is estimated by us that the market reflected a small surplus of approximately  tonnes 
inventories of nickel on the lme  a physical market where various metals  including nickel  can be bought or sold for prompt or future delivery and also representing the principal terminal market for primary nickel in the world  increased slightly during by  tonnes  remaining at a relatively low level of  tonnes at december  as of february   lme inventories were  tonnes 
the lme cash nickel price opened the year at  per tonne per pound and increased during the first half of as the economies of certain industrialized countries began to recover from their relatively low fourth quarter levels  ending the first half of the year at  per tonne per pound 
prices declined through the third quarter to the mid  per tonne level as concern over the pace of economic recovery and uncertainty about a potential war with iraq adversely affected the nickel markets 
prices increased in the fourth quarter  underpinned by improving fundamentals for nickel  ending the year at  per tonne per pound 
as of february   the lme cash nickel price increased to  tonne per pound 
an uncertain global economic environment would be expected to have a significant adverse effect on our business and financial results given the correlation between industrial production and demand for primary nickel and our other products 
there can be no assurance that the excess supply situations which have existed historically in the nickel markets will not occur in the future 
any such excess supply condition would have an adverse effect on the prices realized by us for our nickel products 
other international economic trends  expectations of inflation and political events in major nickel producing and consuming countries can also adversely affect nickel prices and the prices of other metals produced by us 
these factors are beyond our control and have resulted  and are expected to continue to result  in a high degree of price volatility for nickel and other primary metals produced by us 
the table below shows the average annual lme cash nickel price for there can be no assurance that the price for nickel or other metals produced by us will not decline significantly from current levels 
a return to the relatively low price of nickel reflected by the lme cash nickel price which prevailed through most of and into the first half of and during a portion of the second half of would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the nickel market in was a very challenging one compared with when total world demand for primary nickel had achieved a record level 
market fundamentals weakened during as the world s major economies experienced softness and recessionary conditions intensified in the manufacturing sectors of virtually all of the major industrial countries that are members of the oecd 
this weakness in demand was primarily concentrated within the western world where nickel demand declined significantly 
while there was continued strength in nickel demand in china in  we estimate that there was an overall decline in nickel demand  on a western world plus china basis  of per cent to approximately  tonnes 
virtually all major applications for nickel were adversely affected by the economic slowdown experienced in the western world during  including significant weakness in non stainless applications 
non ferrous nickel alloys and special powder applications were negatively affected by the substantial decline in electronic and telecommunication applications as manufacturing activity contracted largely in order to liquidate excess inventories that had been built up  particularly in western world countries 
stainless steel demand was also adversely affected 
stainless steel producers in all major producing countries except japan responded to the slowdown in demand with production cutbacks in order to prevent an accumulation of finished stainless steel inventory 
western world plus china stainless steel production declined by per cent to million tonnes  following an increase of per cent in primary nickel consumption in stainless steel applications  however  actually rose  aided by a reduction in the supply of stainless steel scrap to stainless steel producers in the second half of the year 
growth in primary nickel supply continued in as most producers increased production  particularly in the first half of the year 
however  with the decline in nickel prices and weak market conditions  a number of production cutbacks were announced over the second half of taking into account these production cutbacks  reflected a net increase in western world plus china primary nickel production of  tonnes to  tonnes 
the largest sources of this increase in supply were the continued ramping up of certain laterite projects in australia and the commissioning of new capacity in venezuela and colombia 
western world plus china supply rose to  tonnes  reflecting increases in net supply from russia  cuba and eastern europe of  tonnes 
overall  reflecting the decline in demand and increase in supply  the nickel market in shifted to a surplus position of approximately  tonnes on a western world plus china basis following the significant deficit positions in the previous two years 
over the year  nickel inventories held by consumers are estimated to have fallen by  tonnes 
despite the slowdown  lme inventories increased by only  tonnes  ending the year with a relatively low level of lme inventories of  tonnes 
the cash nickel price on the lme opened the year at  per tonne per pound and fell during the first quarter  reaching a first half low of  per tonne per pound in early april before attempting a rally over the second quarter as the market began to anticipate an early economic recovery 
however  with the continuation of a supply surplus in the market and ongoing economic uncertainty  the nickel price again moved lower and reached the year s low of  per tonne per pound in late october 
with the aggressive reduction of interest rates in the united states and renewed prospects for an economic recovery  prices for nickel and other non ferrous metals improved in the fourth quarter 
the lme cash nickel price was  per tonne per pound as of december  lme average annual cash nickel price for per tonne    per pound results of operations compared with earnings summary our results reflected a net loss of  million  or per common share  in  compared with net earnings of million  or per share  in results for included non cash after tax asset impairment charges of  million  or per share  to reduce the carrying value of the voisey s bay project and certain other assets  an after tax charge of million  or cents per share  relating to the temporary suspension of certain development activities and other actions concerning the goro project  as discussed under goro project suspension costs and outlook goro project below  after tax interest income of million  or four cents per share  associated with a tax refund and unfavourable non cash currency translation adjustments of million  or three cents per share 
our results also reflected higher average realized prices for nickel  increased deliveries of inco source nickel and platinum group metals  higher other income and reduced interest expense  partially offset by lower realized prices for platinum group metals and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
our results included a non cash deferred tax benefit of million  or cents per share  recorded in the second quarter of  and favourable currency translation adjustments of million  or cents per share  for the year 
the tax benefit was due to the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities for reductions in future tax rates by the provinces of ontario and manitoba 
net sales net sales to customers increased by five per cent in due to higher realized prices for and deliveries of nickel and higher deliveries of platinum group metals  partially offset by lower realized prices for platinum group metals 
primary nickel sales increased by per cent in due to a per cent increase in the average realized price and a one per cent increase in deliveries 
total deliveries of nickel were higher in due to higher demand for our products  primarily in the stainless steel industry 
our nickel deliveries in represented an estimated per cent share of the world market  compared with per cent in and per cent in our price realizations tend to lag lme cash price movements  due primarily to the terms of contractual sales agreements with certain of our customers 
we realize a premium over the prevailing lme cash price for our nickel powders and other value added products 
the average realized price for our primary nickel products  including intermediates  was  per tonne per pound in  compared with  per tonne per pound in for the january february  period  the lme cash nickel price averaged  per tonne per pound 
the price realizations for our nickel and other metals products generally reflect lme or other metal market prices and  over the longer term  depend principally upon the balance between demand for our products in the marketplace relative to supply available from us and our competitors  including for this purpose  secondary or scrap materials containing metals in usable or recyclable form and supplies of other materials which may compete as substitutes 
as noted above  the availability of nickel containing stainless steel scrap  which competes directly with primary nickel as a source of nickel for use in the production of stainless steel  is particularly important to stainless steel primary nickel demand 
the scrap ratio  or that portion of total nickel units consumed in the form of nickel containing scrap by stainless steel producers in the western world plus china  was per cent in  compared with per cent in and per cent in realized prices the following table sets forth our average annual realized prices for the years indicated for the metals products we produce and sell per tonne per pound primary nickel  including intermediates   copper    cobalt    per troy ounce platinum palladium rhodium   gold silver deliveries and net sales by product the following table sets forth deliveries and sales of our principal metals products for the years indicated deliveries tonnes sales millions deliveries tonnes sales millions deliveries tonnes sales millions primary nickel including intermediates inco source    purchased    copper inco source    purchased   cobalt    precious metals thousands of troy ounces    other net sales to customers    excludes toll refined materials 
copper sales decreased by six per cent in due to a two per cent decline in our average realized price and a three per cent decline in deliveries 
sales of precious metals decreased by per cent in due to lower realized prices  partially offset by higher deliveries from increased production 
costs and expenses other income the following table sets forth our costs  expenses and other income for the years indicated millions cost of sales and operating exp    depreciation and depletion selling  general and administra research and development exploration currency translation adjustment asset impairment charges  goro project suspension costs interest expense other income  net income and mining taxes minority interest cost of sales and operating expenses cost of sales and operating expenses decreased by million  or three per cent  in this decrease was primarily due to lower energy costs and lower deliveries of purchased nickel to customers  partially offset by higher employment  supplies and services expenses 
depreciation and depletion depreciation and depletion expenses decreased by three per cent in primarily due to lower depletion expense at pt inco resulting from the reduced production attributable to a planned rebuild of a furnace and related facilities 
this project is expected to be completed during the first quarter of selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in  primarily due to increased staffing  support and other expenses related to the advancement of our goro and voisey s bay projects  higher accruals for share appreciation rights expense under our stock compensation plans  increased ontario capital taxes and higher legal fees relating primarily to certain outstanding tax matters and litigation 
research and development research and development expense decreased by million in  primarily due to reduced spending on development of certain nickel products 
exploration exploration expense in was comparable with the level of such expense for currency translation adjustments currency translation adjustments of million in primarily represented the translation of canadian dollar denominated liabilities  principally accounts payable  deferred income and mining taxes and post retirement benefits  into us dollars 
the change of million from was due to a strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during  whereas in there was a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
asset impairment charges on june   we announced that we would be undertaking a review of the net carrying value of our voisey s bay project in view of the statement of principles entered into with the government of the province of newfoundland and labrador on that date and other arrangements with key stakeholders that would enable the development of that project to proceed 
we had noted on a number of occasions in our public filings and other documents that such events  if and when they were to occur  might require a significant reduction in the carrying value of the voisey s bay project and in the related deferred income and mining tax liability and in shareholders equity 
this review  which was completed in july  included an analysis of the key assumptions which we utilized in evaluating this net carrying value on a quarter to quarter basis relating to a number of important factors  including our best assessment of the expected cash flows from the project  how the development of voisey s bay  taking into account the agreements which have been reached  fits within our overall long term development plans and updated mining and other cost assumptions 
as a result of this review  we recorded a non cash charge of  million  net of deferred income and mining taxes of million  in the second quarter of to reduce the  million net carrying value of the voisey s bay project to  million 
in  as a result of a change in canadian gaap  the deferred income and mining tax liability associated with voisey s bay was increased by  million and the carrying value of voisey s bay was also increased by this same amount 
in addition  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income and mining taxes of million  in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying values of certain plant  equipment and other assets to their estimated net recoverable amounts based on an evaluation of their recoverability 
the principal component of this charge related to capitalized exploration and development costs of the victor deep exploration project at our ontario operations that  as a result of the development of the deposits covered by our voisey s bay projects  would probably not be put into production 
the balance of this charge consisted primarily of reductions to certain redundant plant  equipment and non core assets as well as an additional provision for losses relating to certain receivables and other assets arising from our commercial relationships with one of our principal customers that had filed for bankruptcy protection in late march in the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million  net of income and mining taxes of million  for losses associated with certain receivables and other assets as a result of this bankruptcy filing 
goro project suspension costs in early september  the goro project experienced temporary labour disruptions by personnel associated with certain project construction subcontractors 
as a result of these disruptions  a decision was made to curtail certain activities at the project s site to enable us  contractors  subcontractors and other interested parties to develop procedures to avoid future disruptions 
over the september november period  a number of procedures were put in place as part of a phased resumption of certain of the project activities that had been curtailed 
during this period  we also initiated an update of the status of certain key aspects of the project  including the necessary permitting  capital cost estimate  project schedule and organization 
work on certain critical parts of the project  including engineering  continued during this update process 
on december   we announced that we would be undertaking a comprehensive review of the goro project 
this action had been based upon information from the project s principal firms providing project engineering  procurement and construction management services that we had received that  if confirmed  would indicate an increase in the capital cost for the project in the range of to per cent above the then current capital cost estimate of  million 
as a result of the temporary suspension of certain development activities and other actions which had been taken by year end during this review process  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of this charge comprised million relating to the cancellation or termination of certain outstanding contractual obligations  to accrue for demobilization costs and to reduce the carrying value of certain assets relating to the project  partially offset by currency hedging gains of million on certain forward currency contracts 
these contracts  which had been entered into to reduce exposure to exchange rate changes associated with certain planned project expenditures to be incurred in certain currencies  were closed out in early january since they no longer matched the timing of such expenditures due to their expected deferral as a result of the review being undertaken 
interest expense interest expense excluded capitalized interest of million in and million in on debt incurred to finance the development of the voisey s bay and goro projects 
the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt in relative to and increased capitalized interest on debt incurred to finance the development of the voisey s bay and goro projects 
given the increase in debt in  we expect that our interest payments will increase to approximately million in  with approximately million of that amount expected to be expensed and million expected to be capitalized as part of the goro and voisey s bay projects 
at december   approximately per cent of our long term debt reflected interest rates that were subject to periodic adjustments based on market interest rates 
our long term debt and average effective interest rates at december  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
reference is also made to cash flows  liquidity and capital resources financing activities below 
other income  net other income increased by million in  primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and marketable securities in  compared with  interest income of million associated with a tax refund and gains realized from the sales of securities 
income and mining taxes in  the effective income and mining tax rate of relief was per cent  compared with per cent in in  income and mining taxes included a deferred tax benefit of million due to the revaluation of deferred income and mining tax liabilities for reductions in future tax rates by the provinces of ontario and manitoba 
excluding this benefit  the effective tax rate in was lower than the effective rate of per cent in the decrease was primarily due to the impact of the asset impairment charges  a portion of which was not deductible for tax purposes  lower mining taxes and lower foreign tax rate differences  partially offset by lower resource and depletion allowances 
minority interest minority interest of million in represents principally the respective minority shareholders interests in the earnings of pt inco  itl and jinco 
the increase in minority interest in was due primarily to the higher earnings of pt inco  partially offset by million relating to the goro project suspension costs referred to above 
nickel production nickel production increased by one per cent to  tonnes in from  tonnes in the increase was primarily due to the decision to operate the ontario operations in without any planned maintenance shutdown 
nickel production in was  however  below the planned target of  tonnes 
nickel production was affected during the second half of by certain technical problems experienced at the manitoba operations in blending purchased intermediates from australia with manitoba source ores  including ores with relatively high magnesium oxide mgo levels and maintenance and equipment problems at certain mines at the ontario operations 
the maintenance and equipment problems experienced were resolved and technical personnel have continued to work on possible solutions to the blending of ores containing relatively high mgo levels at the manitoba operations  with a resolution currently anticipated to be implemented during the first half of finished nickel inventories were  tonnes at december   compared with  tonnes at the end of production of nickel in matte at pt inco decreased by five per cent to  tonnes in  reflecting the planned rebuild of a furnace and related facilities 
copper production copper production decreased by four per cent to  tonnes in copper production in was below the planned target of  tonnes 
the decline was due to production and mechanical difficulties at the ontario operations 
nickel unit production costs our operating results  in addition to being affected by worldwide market conditions  are influenced by changes in production costs 
unit production costs for nickel are affected principally by the level of costs and expenses  average ore grades  production and productivity 
nickel unit production costs represent the total of all cash costs such as wages and benefits including pension and other post retirement benefits  energy  supplies and services and non cash costs such as depreciation and depletion incurred to produce a unit of nickel 
these costs were slightly higher in relative to nickel unit cash cost of sales is a key performance measure we use to manage our costs and profitability 
nickel unit cash cost of sales before by product credits  representing a calculation equal to the total of all cash costs incurred to produce a unit of nickel before the deduction of credits for by products sold divided by inco source nickel deliveries  increased slightly to  per tonne per pound in from  per tonne per pound in this increase was due to higher operating expenses  principally employment  services and supplies expenses  partially offset by lower energy costs at pt inco due to lower consumption of and prices for fuel oil 
nickel unit cash cost of sales after by product credits  representing a calculation equal to the total of all cash costs incurred to produce a unit of nickel after the deduction of credits for by products sold divided by inco source nickel deliveries  increased by seven per cent to  per tonne per pound in from  per tonne per pound in  primarily due to lower realized prices for palladium  copper and cobalt  and higher nickel unit cash cost of sales before by product credits  partially offset by higher deliveries of precious metals 
it is currently expected that at least some of the principal factors which have caused such increases in nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits will continue to adversely affect such nickel unit cash costs into as discussed under outlook below 
it is also expected that pension expense will continue to increase in  which is also expected to adversely affect future nickel unit cash costs 
as a result of changes in certain assumptions and actual experience of plan assets as well as certain legislative and regulatory requirements referred to under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources below  we currently expect that pension expense will increase from the level of million to approximately million in and  depending upon the future performance of our pension plan assets and other related factors  are also expected to remain at least at that level for the next few years 
energy cost advantages energy costs are a significant component of production costs in the nickel industry since nickel production is highly energy intensive  especially in respect of processing lateritic ores 
we enjoy relatively low energy costs because of substantial production from our canadian sulphide ores  which consume only about one fifth of the energy required to process lateritic ores 
in addition  low cost energy is available from our hydroelectric facilities in ontario and at pt inco s lateritic mining operation in indonesia  and from purchased hydroelectric power at the manitoba operations 
in  our hydroelectric facilities in ontario generated approximately per cent of the ontario operations electrical requirements  and pt inco s megawatt hydroelectric generating facility at larona and its newer facility at balambano  which has an average design capacity of megawatts and has operated above that capacity  generated virtually all of pt inco s electrical requirements 
in  energy costs at the canadian operations were approximately per cent of total cash production costs  compared with per cent for pt inco 
the availability of captive hydroelectric power decreased cash energy costs of pt inco in by about per cent  compared with about per cent in and per cent in  relative to the energy costs that would have been incurred had pt inco been totally energy dependent on fuel oil 
compared with earnings summary net earnings were million  or per common share  in  compared with million  or per share  in the lower earnings in reflected significantly lower realized prices for nickel and lower realized prices for copper  partially offset by higher deliveries of inco source nickel and platinum group metals and reduced interest and minority interest expenses 
our results included a non cash deferred tax benefit of million  or cents per share  recorded in the second quarter of  and favourable currency translation adjustments of million  or cents per share  for the year 
the tax benefit was due to the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities for reductions in future tax rates by the provinces of ontario and manitoba 
results for included a non cash deferred tax benefit of million  or cents per share  resulting from a reduction in future tax rates by the province of ontario and favourable currency translation adjustments of million  or cents per share 
net sales net sales to customers decreased by per cent in due to significantly lower realized prices for and deliveries of nickel and lower realized prices for copper  partially offset by higher deliveries of platinum group metals 
primary nickel sales decreased by per cent in due to a per cent decline in the average realized price and an per cent decline in deliveries 
total deliveries of nickel were lower in due to lower deliveries of purchased finished nickel  reflecting lower demand in all markets across the western world due principally to the weakness experienced in the manufacturing sectors of virtually all of the oecd member countries 
however  deliveries of inco source nickel increased by four per cent in  reflecting higher production at pt inco and the manitoba operations 
deliveries of finished nickel purchased from external sources  used to supplement inco source production as required  declined in as a result of higher inco source production in and lower demand 
the average realized price for primary nickel products  including intermediates  was  per tonne per pound in  compared with  per tonne per pound in copper sales decreased by per cent in due to a per cent decline in the average realized price and a one per cent decline in deliveries 
sales of precious metals increased by per cent in due to higher deliveries from increased production 
cost of sales and operating expenses cost of sales and operating expenses decreased by million  or per cent  in this decrease was primarily due to lower deliveries of and prices paid for purchased nickel and the favourable impact on production costs of the weaker canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  partially offset by slightly higher operating expenses 
the canadian dollar  the currency in which a substantial portion of operating expenses are incurred  weakened against the us dollar by four per cent in  based upon the average exchange rate for the year 
the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar was six per cent lower at year end than at year end depreciation and depletion depreciation and depletion expenses of million in were comparable with million in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in  primarily due to higher expenses related to new projects and higher legal fees 
research and development research and development expense decreased by million in  primarily due to reduced spending on development of certain nickel products 
exploration exploration expense in was comparable with the level of such expense for currency translation adjustments currency translation adjustments of million in primarily represented the translation of canadian dollar denominated liabilities  principally accounts payable  deferred income and mining taxes and post retirement benefits  into us dollars 
the increase of million from was due to the further weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during interest expense interest expense excluded capitalized interest of million in and million in on debt incurred to finance the acquisition and development of the voisey s bay and goro projects 
the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to lower average debt outstanding and lower rates in relative to other income  net other income increased by million in  primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and marketable securities in compared with income and mining taxes income and mining taxes included a deferred tax benefit of million in due to the revaluation of deferred income and mining tax liabilities for reductions in future tax rates by the provinces of ontario and manitoba 
in  income and mining taxes included a deferred tax benefit of million due to the revaluation of deferred income and mining tax liabilities for reductions in future tax rates by the province of ontario 
in  the effective income and mining tax rate of relief was per cent  compared with a tax rate of per cent in the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher tax rate changes on deferred taxes  partially offset by lower mining taxes  resource and depletion allowances  non deductible currency translation adjustments and foreign tax rate differences 
minority interest minority interest of million in represents principally the respective minority shareholders interests in the earnings of pt inco  itl and jinco 
the decrease in minority interest in was due primarily to the lower earnings of pt inco 
nickel production nickel production increased by two per cent to  tonnes in from  tonnes in the increase was due to higher production from the manitoba operations and pt inco  partially offset by lower production from the ontario operations 
production from the manitoba operations increased as a result of processing higher volumes of purchased intermediates  as discussed under other risks and uncertainties uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates below  and the higher production at pt inco reflected the continuing ramp up to design capacity of the expanded processing facilities 
the lower production at the ontario operations was primarily due to the adverse impact of unexpected production disruptions in the third quarter of  which were rectified 
finished nickel inventories were  tonnes at december   compared with  tonnes at the end of production of nickel in matte at pt inco increased by six per cent to  tonnes in copper production copper production increased by two per cent to  tonnes in despite the adverse impact of a fire at a new copper anode refining facility at the ontario operations in nickel unit production costs nickel unit production costs were the same in relative to productivity was the same in as in nickel unit cash cost of sales before by product credits increased by five per cent to  per tonne per pound in this increase was principally due to higher operating expenses  partially offset by the favourable effect of the lower canadian dollar  relative to the us dollar  on production costs 
nickel unit cash cost of sales after by product credits increased by per cent to  per tonne per pound in primarily due to higher nickel unit cash cost of sales before by product credits and lower contributions from by products  principally resulting from lower realized prices for copper and cobalt  partially offset by higher deliveries of precious metals 
cash flows  liquidity and capital resources compared with operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  up from million in this increase was due primarily to higher earnings  excluding asset impairment and other non cash charges  and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities and income and mining taxes payable 
net tax refunds totalled million in  compared with net tax payments of million in as a result of the timing of our normal tax payments  tax payments totalling approximately million are expected to be made by the end of the first quarter of millions net cash provided by operating activities we have had in effect for a number of years defined benefit pension plans principally in canada  the united states and the united kingdom 
each of the jurisdictions in which these plans are located has legislation and regulations which  among other statutory requirements  cover the minimum contributions to be made to these plans to meet their potential liabilities as calculated in accordance with such legislation and regulations 
based upon the year end values of the assets in those plans that are subject to provincial legislation and regulations in canada and other factors to be taken into account under such legislative or regulatory requirements  it is currently estimated that we will  in accordance with applicable legislation or regulations  increase our contributions to such plans from the level of million to approximately million in and we currently expect that the level of contributions will be in the million range level for and remain at that level for at least two additional years 
the actual increase in such contributions will be determined in accordance with such legislation and regulations  including required actuarial calculations by mid  based upon the value of the assets in such plans  in each case as of december  we have  based upon recent and anticipated future stock market performance and related factors  reduced the return on investment and discount rate assumptions to be used in calculating the level of pension contributions and expenses for these plans 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities increased to million in  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to higher planned capital expenditures  mainly in respect of the voisey s bay and goro projects 
reference is made to risks and uncertainties capital requirements and operating risks below for a discussion of our current estimate of capital expenditures 
the following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the years indicated millions ontario operations manitoba operations pt inco goro project voisey s bay project other total financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in increased to million from million in principally as a result of the two debt offerings discussed below 
on may   we issued and sold through an underwritten public offering in the united states million aggregate principal amount of notes due the net cash proceeds of million received from this sale  after commissions and other expenses  are being used to finance certain capital expenditures relating to existing operations and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures for development projects 
on september   we issued and sold through an underwritten public offering in the united states million aggregate principal amount of debentures due the net cash proceeds of million received from this sale  after commissions and other expenses  are being used to fund capital requirements to sustain existing operations and for general corporate purposes  which may include the purchase or redemption of outstanding securities other than common shares and funding capital expenditures for development projects 
holders of our zero coupon convertible notes lyon notes due march  had a special conversion right  exercisable on april   giving them the right to convert the then accreted value of their lyon notes totalling approximately million into common shares at the then market price of such shares 
on april   none of the holders of the lyon notes elected to exercise their right to convert the lyon notes into common shares 
subsequent special conversion rights may be exercised on march in each of  and if holders were to exercise these rights  we have the right to satisfy this special conversion feature by delivering cash in lieu of common shares and it is our current intention to satisfy any future conversions and the related accreted value of the lyon notes in cash 
preferred dividends totalling million were paid in each of the years and on the series e preferred shares in accordance with the terms of those shares 
dividends paid to minority interest shareholders were million in each of and to provide liquidity for our operations  we maintain committed bank credit facilities aggregating million at december   including one facility entered into by one of our united states subsidiaries 
these facilities are provided by a group of banks under separate agreements  the terms of which are substantially the same 
except for three facilities totalling million in commitments  the facilities include revolving commitments of from days to up to five years 
the other three facilities totalling million in commitments have only revolving periods which expire either in june or june the revolving period of each of the facilities may be extended for an additional day period at the discretion of the respective bank under the particular facility  subject to the approval of lenders representing  in the aggregate  at least per cent of the total aggregate commitments under the facilities  and any amounts outstanding at the maturity of the revolving period are repayable at that time 
the revolving periods for the facilities currently expire on dates ranging from june  to june   with million of these facilities expiring on june  while we do not currently expect that we will not be able to renew these facilities when they expire we cannot predict what  if any  changes in the interest rates or other terms and conditions of such facilities might be required to obtain their renewal 
the facilities currently bear interest  when drawn  at one per cent over the relevant london interbank offered rate 
if a significant portion of these facilities could not be renewed on acceptable terms to us  this development could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to meet our financing requirements for our existing operations and development projects  liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
each facility provides that  so long as advances are outstanding  we will be required to maintain a tangible net worth  as defined  of not less than  million and a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to tangible net worth  as defined  not to exceed at december   taking into account the asset impairment charges relating to the reduction in the carrying value of the voisey s bay project and certain other assets and the charge for the goro project suspension costs referred to above  the tangible net worth was  million and the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to tangible net worth was there can be no assurance that future material adverse developments would not result in a breach of these covenants 
if we were unable to comply with these covenants  the bank lenders would have the right to declare a default and require all then outstanding loans to be repaid and pursue the various remedies available to them under the bank credit facilities  including declining to make any new loans under such facilities 
any such action by the lenders could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our financing requirements for our existing operations and development projects  and our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
none of these facilities has any covenant which would require any acceleration or prepayment of outstanding balances if our credit ratings on outstanding debt securities were downgraded or there were a significant decline in our earnings  cash flow or in the price of our publicly traded common shares or other equity securities but a downgrade in rating would increase the interest rate payable on borrowings under the facilities and  conversely  an upgrade in the rating would decrease the interest rate payable on borrowings 
the credit rating agencies rate our outstanding debt securities  which were rated as investment grade as of february   according to standard criteria 
these criteria include  among others  profitability  balance sheet and interest coverage ratios  and future business plans and prospects 
accordingly  our credit ratings are dependent upon a number of factors  including the views of the credit rating agencies on the nickel industry s supply demand balance and the long term price of nickel  and our ability to continue to be one of the low cost producers of primary nickel and generate cash flow from operations 
any significant downgrade in our current credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our access to the capital markets and the terms under which we can borrow funds on a short term and long term basis 
our total debt as a percentage of our total debt plus shareholders equity as of december for the years indicated is set forth in the following table december total debt as of total debt plus shareholders equity at december   cash and marketable securities were  million  up significantly from million at december   reflecting increased net cash provided by operating activities and a significant portion of the aggregate net proceeds of million received from the sales of debt securities in the second and third quarters of total debt at december  was  million  up million from million at the end of  reflecting the two debt offerings in we believe that our level of cash and marketable securities as of december   together with cash provided by operations and available cash proceeds from our unused lines of credit and access to international capital markets  will be more than sufficient to finance our currently anticipated cash requirements in these requirements include ongoing cash needs as well as the cash required to finance currently planned expenditures on sustaining and other capital projects  including the voisey s bay and goro projects 
long term contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes as of december  certain of our long term contractual obligations and commercial commitments for each of the next five years and thereafter payments due in millions total thereafter long term debt   operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabil es and contractual obligations total   these purchase obligations exclude certain orders to purchase goods and services that are placed in the ordinary course of business 
these contractual obligations exclude the estimated future closure and decommissioning costs referred to in note and the estimated future post retirement benefits obligations referred to in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the contractual obligations and commercial commitments set forth in the table above include our commitments for the goro project  as noted under outlook goro project below  and certain commitments through march for the voisey s bay project  in each case as of december  except for these commitments  this table does not include our expected capital expenditures over the next five years and thereafter 
we currently estimate that our existing operations require  on an annual basis  in the range of approximately million to continue to sustain their operations  including to meet existing environmental requirements  at the planned production and or utilization levels for these operations 
the total capital expenditures for our voisey s bay and goro projects will be dependent on a number of factors  including  in the case of the goro project  the results of the review process for goro referred to under goro project suspension costs above  the availability of certain financing from the french government and the acquisition  as discussed under outlook goro project below  of an interest in goro by one or more parties 
there are no significant long term contractual arrangements with any related parties that create or result in any obligations that are not on an arm s length  negotiated basis 
with respect to mandatory redemption requirements over the period  reference is made to i the discussion below relating to the special conversion right holders of the lyon notes have  ii note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the redemption of certain long term debt and iii note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the mandatory redemption of the series e preferred shares in august off balance sheet financing arrangements our only significant off balance sheet financing arrangements  in addition to the derivative instruments referred to under risks and uncertainties below  involve accounts receivable securitized financing arrangements with unrelated entities under which up to approximately million in eligible receivables may be sold by us to these entities at any time 
under the accounts receivable financing arrangements  a significant deterioration in our credit rating and or accounts receivable being sold could give the purchaser of such receivables the right not to renew the arrangements 
at december   there was a limited recourse liability of million  representing per cent of the aggregate eligible receivable sold in connection with these accounts receivable financing arrangements 
compared with operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  down from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower operating earnings and income and mining taxes payable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
tax payments were million in and million in investing activities net cash used for investing activities increased to million in  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures  mainly in respect of the goro project 
financing activities notwithstanding a decline in net cash provided by operating activities  reflecting lower earnings due to lower nickel demand and reduced nickel prices  and increased capital expenditures in  compared with  net cash flow before financing activities was positive 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  compared with net cash used for financing activities of million in on march   we issued and sold  on a bought deal basis  the year lyon notes referred to above for gross proceeds of million 
the net cash proceeds received from this sale of million  after commissions and other expenses  were used to repay fixed rate debt and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures for the goro and other development projects 
under canadian gaap  the lyon notes are classified as an equity instrument and not debt 
the lyon notes accrete over years to their value at maturity of million through periodic after tax charges to retained earnings 
under canadian gaap  the lyon notes are not dilutive for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share based on our right to  and current intention that we will  eventually meet the redemption and conversion terms of these notes in cash 
the lyon notes are classified as debt under united states gaap 
reference is made to notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
preferred dividends totalling million were paid in each of the years and on the series e preferred shares in accordance with the terms of those shares 
dividends paid to minority interest shareholders were million in and million in total debt at december  was million  down million from  million at the end of the decrease in debt in was due to repayments  primarily from the proceeds of the sale of the lyon notes as well as regularly scheduled repayments of pt inco debt 
risks and uncertainties the following risks and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our outlook and future prospects 
market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
given the nature of our business and operations  the areas of highest exposure are nickel prices and  to a lesser extent  the prices of other metals and commodities that we produce or purchase metals and commodities risk  foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange risk and interest rates interest rate risk 
in the case of metals and commodities risks  we sell our products at prices based on world market prices and purchase fuel oil and other supplies at market prices for these commodities 
while prices for our primary nickel and other metals produced are based largely on  and sold in  us dollars  we are subject to foreign exchange risk because we incur a substantial portion of our costs and expenses in currencies other than the us dollar  in particular in the canadian dollar 
we are exposed to additional foreign exchange risk and are also exposed to interest rate risk because we fund our operations and capital expenditures primarily through long term and short term borrowings in us dollars 
based upon past movements of certain foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  as described below and our current expectations of changes in such exchange rates and interest rates for  we believe that the potential near term impact on future earnings and cash flows with respect to foreign currency and interest rate risks will not have a material impact on our financial condition 
the metals and commodity risk relating to nickel and  to a lesser extent  other metals produced by us  given the significance of price realizations to us of such metals  is expected to continue to have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
we have engaged in transactions to reduce the impact of certain of these market risks to which we are exposed to a significant degree on our earnings and cash flows 
we have established policies and procedures governing the use of derivative instruments to address certain market risks 
these policies and procedures are intended to reduce certain of the uncertainties associated with the market risks specific to our business and operations and reduce the effect of market fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
we do not use these instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we only use derivative instruments based on an economic analysis of the underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse effects on future earnings and cash flows due to fluctuations in metals and commodities prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates will be offset by proceeds from  and changes in the fair value of  the derivative instruments 
we do not  however  hedge our exposure to all market risks and do not hedge our exposure to any market risk in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flows 
metals and commodities risk we are subject to metals and commodities risk because we sell our products and purchase fuel oil and other supplies at prices effectively determined through trading on major commodity exchanges  notably the lme and the new york mercantile exchange 
the prices offered on these exchanges generally reflect the global balance of supply and demand for a particular commodity but are also influenced in the short term by such factors as investment funds flow  speculative activity and currency exchange rates 
the price of nickel  our principal product  was the major factor influencing operating earnings and cash flows for the years ended december   and and for prior years 
our selling price for primary nickel is generally based on the lme cash nickel price 
however  certain of our products are customarily sold at a premium over the lme cash price  particularly special products such as nickel powders and foams 
the markets for our products have been  and are expected to continue to be  cyclical in nature and prices are volatile 
however  because we are one of the largest producers and marketers of primary nickel in the world  we have chosen  subject to certain limited exceptions  not to hedge or otherwise attempt to mitigate to any significant degree the risk of fluctuations in the price of nickel 
we review this policy from time to time and may increase the currently limited use of derivative instruments to reduce such risks in the future 
in the case of other metals produced by us  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments to establish minimum prices 
we do enter into lme forward sales and or purchase contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in the prices of purchased intermediates and finished nickel and of inco source nickel to be delivered to customers at fixed prices three or more months in the future 
the following table shows our principal derivative instrument positions as of december  principal derivative instrument positions december  total lme forward nickel purchase contracts s tonnes   average price per tonne     palladium fixed price swaps troy ounces    average price per troy ounce platinum fixed price swaps troy ounces    average price per troy ounce fuel oil fixed price swaps tonnes    average price per tonne currencies forward contracts to purchase cdn 
millions average price us aus 
millions average price us euro millions average price us interest rate swap notional principal amount mill s maturity we use fuel oil swap contracts to hedge the effect of energy price changes in respect of a portion of our energy requirements in indonesia 
under these contracts  we receive or make payments based on the difference between a fixed and floating price for fuel oil 
reference is made to notes and d to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning our derivative instruments including how the fair value of such instruments has been determined 
as we become a significant producer of cobalt once our development projects begin commercial production  we could be affected by the highly competitive market for cobalt that currently exists and is expected to continue to prevail 
foreign exchange risk by virtue of our international operations  we conduct business in a number of foreign currencies other than the us dollar 
these exchange rates have varied substantially in the last three years 
a substantial portion of our revenue is received in us dollars since the price of nickel and other metals produced are generally referenced in us dollars  while a significant portion of our costs and expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar and between the us dollar and other currencies will give rise to foreign currency exposure  either favourable or unfavourable  which have materially affected and are expected to continue to impact our future results of operations and financial condition 
our primary foreign exchange risk is to changes in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
we reduce  from time to time  the impact of this risk by entering into forward currency contracts and foreign currency options 
however  these activities do not eliminate the potentially significant adverse effect that exchange rate fluctuations could have on our results of operations or financial condition 
at the end of  these contracts took the form of forward contracts  which establish a fixed exchange rate for the canadian dollar  and forward currency contracts that establish a fixed price for the future purchase of certain currencies in connection with the goro project 
the purpose of the canadian dollar hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual us dollar cash flows relating to a portion of future canadian production costs will be adversely affected by an appreciation of the canadian dollar 
the purpose of the euro and australian dollar forward currency contracts is to hedge a portion of the future construction costs of the planned production facilities for the goro project in new caledonia 
as discussed under goro project suspension costs above  certain of these contracts were closed out in early we are  to a substantially lesser extent  subject to fluctuations in the value of the indonesian rupiah relative to the us dollar from our operations in indonesia 
this reduced impact is due to a significant portion of pt inco s costs and revenues being effectively denominated in us dollars 
because of the limited nature of this exposure  we do not customarily hedge the value of the rupiah against the us dollar and no such financial instruments were in effect at december  interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates results from investing and borrowing activities undertaken to manage our liquidity and capital requirements 
we generally have used fixed rate debt to finance long term investments  while variable rate debt has been used to meet working capital requirements and related requirements on a more near term basis 
at december   approximately per cent of total debt  or million  was subject to variable interest rates 
based upon the level of floating or variable rate debt at december   the impact of a per cent change in interest rates  or basis points  would change interest expense by less than million over a full year 
at the end of  we had an interest rate swap intended to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our fixed rate debt 
the interest rate swap changes our exposure to interest rate risk by effectively converting a portion of our fixed rate debt to a floating rate 
as noted under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources compared with above  we may be required to raise additional debt in the future and  accordingly  we could be materially adversely affected by changes in interest rates in the future despite any interest rate swaps we then might have in effect 
counterparty risk our interest rate swaps  metals hedging and foreign currency risk management activities expose us to the risk of default by the counterparties to such arrangements 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative instruments subject to credit risk but mitigate this risk by dealing only with counterparties that we believe to be financially sound and  accordingly  we do not anticipate a loss for non performance 
sensitivities our financial results are sensitive to  among other things  changes in prices for nickel and other metals  the canadian us dollar exchange rate and interest rates 
the financial results are also affected by changes in the indonesian rupiah us dollar exchange rate  but to a lesser extent as pt inco s revenues and many of its expenses are denominated in us dollars 
the following table indicates the approximate full year impact of our principal market risk exposures on net earnings per share  based on planned deliveries of inco source metals and after taking into consideration the principal derivative instrument positions as of december sensitivities change in amount impact on basic net earnings per share realized prices for nickel per tonne copper per tonne cobalt  per tonne platinum per troy ounce palladium per troy ounce fuel oil per tonne natural gas per mm btu us per cdn

our policy is to meet or  if possible  surpass environmental standards set by relevant legislation  by the application of technically proven and economically feasible measures 
operating and capital expenditures during to relating to our ongoing environmental and reclamation programs and removal and site restoration costs and related details are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental legislation affects nearly all aspects of our operations worldwide 
these laws apply to us along with other companies in the mining and metals industry 
this type of legislation requires us to obtain operating licenses and imposes standards and controls on activities relating to mining  exploration  development  production  closure and the refining  distribution and marketing of nickel and other metals products 
environmental assessments are required before initiating most new projects or undertaking significant changes to existing operations 
in addition to current requirements  it is expected that additional environmental regulations will likely be implemented to protect the environment and quality of life  given issues of sustainable development and other similar requirements which governmental and supragovernmental organizations and other bodies have been pursuing 
some of the issues currently under review by environmental regulatory agencies include further reducing or stabilizing various emissions  including sulphur dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions  mine reclamation and restoration and water  air and soil quality 
although the ultimate amount to be incurred is uncertain  the total liability for future removal and site restoration costs in respect of our worldwide operations  to be incurred primarily after cessation of operations  is estimated to be approximately million at december   up from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of new estimates for certain sites 
in recognition of this future liability  we have recorded annually commencing in an accounting provision of million for future removal and site restoration costs  which is included in cost of sales and operating expenses 
this amount is based upon the estimated remaining lives of our applicable ore reserves and facilities and is in addition to ongoing operating and capital expenditures 
the estimate of the total liability for future removal and site restoration costs has been developed from independent environmental studies  which include an evaluation of  among other factors  currently available information with respect to closure plans and closure alternatives  the anticipated method and extent of site restoration using current costs and existing technology  and compliance required by presently enacted laws  regulations and existing industry standards 
the total liability for future removal and site restoration costs represents estimated expenditures associated with closure  progressive rehabilitation and post closure care and maintenance 
potential recoveries of funds from the future sale of assets upon the ultimate closure of operations have not been reflected in the estimate of the total liability or related annual provision 
future changes  if any  to the estimated total liability  as a result of amended requirements  laws  regulations and operating assumptions may be significant and would be recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate  when applicable 
environmental laws and regulations are continually evolving in all areas in which we operate 
changes made in to mining regulations in the province of ontario have required us to provide letters of credit or other forms of financial security to fund our future reclamation and restoration costs  which are not expected to be incurred for many years  if we were to no longer meet certain minimum investment grade credit ratings for our outstanding publicly traded debt securities and applicable mine life requirements 
although our debt securities are currently rated investment grade  they were rated below investment grade in recent times and there can be no assurance that this situation will not reoccur 
if we were not able to maintain the minimum investment grade credit ratings  it is currently estimated that letters of credit or other forms of financial security associated with the currently estimated costs of the eventual future closure of mines and other facilities in ontario would have to cover approximately million in such costs 
due to the recent closure of two mines and the pending closure of another mine in ontario  we were required under such mining regulations to provide surety bonds in the amount of million as of december  to secure closure costs 
in addition  we are subject to certain indonesian regulations  which require us to provide security for the reclamation of land areas that have been mined 
in the case of the manitoba operations  it is expected that  based upon recently enacted regulations in the province of manitoba  we will be required to provide some form of financial security for future reclamation and restoration costs 
however  it is not currently expected that these costs and related security with respect to the manitoba and indonesian operations will be of a material amount 
these potential costs might not be incurred until many years in the future 
if these requirements for letters of credit or other forms of financial security had to be satisfied  they could have an adverse effect on the amounts available for borrowing under our bank credit facilities 
in february  the ontario government issued a control order that requires us to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by per cent at the ontario smelting operations by the end of we are implementing a million investment in fluid bed roaster off gas scrubbing technology intended to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions to the new levels mandated by this control order by the end of as part of the control order  we will also be required to reduce ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide  continue research into the technology and economics of further reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions and report annually to the ontario ministry of the environment and the public on the progress of this research program 
the control order calls for a final report on achieving the additional reductions to be submitted by december  we do not currently expect that compliance with the annual sulphur dioxide emission levels from our smelter operations or ground level concentrations levels as set forth in the control order will have any significant effect on our costs  operating procedures or annual production of nickel and other primary metals from the ontario operations 
while we are not able to determine the impact  if any  of significant future changes in regulatory emission limits and other environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future on our results of operations or financial condition or operations due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and ultimate form that such changes may take  any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
canada signed and ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change kyoto protocol in december the kyoto protocol calls for significant reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide  and nationwide ceilings on such emissions 
in november  the federal government of canada released the climate change plan for canada 
the specific requirement of this initiative is also to limit the discharge of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 
neither of these initiatives has as yet established the allocation of restrictions among various sources of greenhouse gases 
while the precise impact on our canadian operations and the operations of others who provide energy or other products or services to us is uncertain at this time  we anticipate that compliance with these initiatives could have a significant adverse effect on our operations and costs 
in  the danish environmental protection agency  as part of the authority granted to it under certain environmental regulations of the european union commission  published draft risk assessment reports  including certain conclusions concerning potential human health hazards associated with soluble nickel 
this agency determined  based on certain animal studies  that soluble nickel is a reproductive toxin and has proposed certain product labelling requirements as a result of this determination 
it has also assessed certain other environmental issues 
in addition  based upon these draft reports and taking into account certain studies  this agency has proposed that soluble nickel be classified under its hazard classification system as a known human carcinogen 
before any such proposed classification could come into effect  a number of regulatory and administrative steps would have to be completed 
if this proposed classification were to come into effect as currently proposed  it could result in use restrictions and other requirements which could have a material adverse effect on certain producers and end users of the forms of nickel covered by such classification and on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
further changes in environmental laws  new information on existing environmental conditions and other events  including legal proceedings brought based upon such conditions or an inability to obtain necessary permits  could require increased accounting reserves or compliance or other expenditures or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
other changes in environmental legislation could have a material adverse effect on product demand  product quality and methods of production and distribution 
the complexity and breadth of these issues make it difficult to predict their future impact on us 
it is anticipated that capital expenditures and operating expenses will increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new and increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
compliance with environmental legislation can require significant expenditures and failure to comply with environmental legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  liability for clean up costs  damages and the loss of important operating permits 
although we are committed to meeting environmental requirements  there can be no assurance that we will be able at all times to be in compliance with all environmental regulations or that steps to bring us into compliance would not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
other risks and uncertainties pt inco our investment in pt inco at book value as of december  was million 
approximately per cent of our planned total production of primary nickel  including intermediates  is currently expected to come from pt inco 
in  to meet pt inco s cash shortfalls attributable principally to the increase in the capital cost of the new hydroelectric facilities which were part of pt inco s expansion project  the relatively low nickel prices at that time  and constraints on pt inco s production attributable to then reduced hydroelectric power generation caused by below average rainfall  we advanced million in total to pt inco 
pt inco may experience cash shortfalls in the future  particularly if there were to be a significant decline in primary nickel demand and nickel prices 
in the event of such a cash shortfall  we may again conclude that it would be necessary to advance cash to pt inco in order to meet pt inco s cash needs 
the uncertain political situation in indonesia  primarily as a result of the economic  social and other issues facing that country  could adversely affect pt inco s ability to operate 
while there has been no indication that the government of the republic of indonesia is considering currency controls  nationalization of certain properties or facilities or other similar actions  regional and local governmental authorities have sought to take greater control of the development of their resources and these or other political developments  including  but not limited to  the possibility of disruptions to pt inco s operations arising out of the actions of non governmental organizations or community activist groups  could have a material adverse effect on pt inco s and  therefore our  nickel production  business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with  and importance of  future low cost nickel projects as part of our goal to be the world s most profitable nickel producer  we have continued our efforts to develop new low cost sources of nickel 
following the completion of the pt inco expansion project in late  we have focused on potential future projects to commercialize the goro and voisey s bay ore deposits 
a number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the development of these projected low cost sources of nickel and other metals  including political  regulatory  design  construction  operating  technical and technological risks  uncertainties relating to capital and other costs and financing risks and  in the case of goro  those risks related to possible political uncertainty in new caledonia 
in addition to these risks and uncertainties  there are certain issues that have to be resolved to proceed with and complete the commercial development of one or both of these deposits 
in the case of goro  we cannot predict what the outcome of our ongoing comprehensive review of the goro project  as discussed under goro project suspension costs  will be  including what the updated capital cost estimate for the project and project schedule would be  and the additional effect  if any  that this review could have on our results of operations or financial condition 
for both projects  other risks and uncertainties include the timing of receipt of all necessary permits and governmental  regulatory and other approvals  engineering and construction timetables  and the necessary financing plans and arrangements for such projects and  in the case of goro  the necessary joint venture  partner or similar investment arrangements and other related agreements and arrangements 
in connection with raising the significant financing which we currently believe will be required for the commercial development of the goro and voisey s bay deposits  we currently expect that  in order to meet such financing needs  we will be required to borrow additional funds and or issue additional debt or arrange other forms of financing and or enter into strategic or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that these issues will be resolved or that we will be able to raise the required funds on acceptable terms when financing is needed for either project 
as discussed under uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates below  while we have certain potential new mine development projects at existing operations in canada  as well as additional resources that could be developed in indonesia  in addition to the voisey s bay and goro projects  if sufficient new low cost sources of nickel are not developed by us on a timely basis  our overall nickel production  particularly at our manitoba operations  could decline by  and our unit cost of production could increase significantly with any material decline in mine production from the canadian operations if such operations were not significantly restructured 
these developments could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the mine  processing plant and most of the related infrastructure required for development of the goro and voisey s bay deposits have not yet been constructed and no commercial mining has commenced 
depending on the severity of winter conditions and other factors applicable to the voisey s bay deposit  it is currently estimated that a period of approximately months from site mobilization will be required to complete construction of the required mine  mill and related facilities for such deposit after all necessary approvals and permits have been secured 
unforeseen conditions or developments could arise during the construction period for either project which could delay or prevent completion  and or substantially increase the cost of construction of the necessary facilities and infrastructure to develop the goro and the voisey s bay deposits 
such events may include  without limitation  shortages of equipment  materials or labour  delays in delivery of equipment or materials  labour disruptions  political events  local or political opposition  civil disturbances  litigation  adverse weather conditions  unanticipated increases in costs  natural disasters  accidents and unforeseen engineering  technical and technological  design  environmental or geological problems 
any delay in construction would delay the production of nickel and other products from the goro and or the voisey s bay deposits  and the expected significant source of revenue for us that production from these deposits would represent 
any such delay could also materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our goro project will involve the application of new processing and other technologies and  depending upon the results of the process research and development program we plan to conduct for our voisey s bay project  that project could also utilize new  but not the same as that which has been developed for goro  processing and other technologies 
there can be no assurance that these technologies will be successfully developed and applied on a commercial basis or that the costs associated with and or the timing of their implementation will not have a material adverse effect on the timing of the start up of commercial production  the capital and or operating costs for either or both projects and on other factors impacting the profitability of these projects 
these developments could materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates during  as mine production at our manitoba operations transitioned from the thompson mine to the lower grade birchtree mine  we experienced lower mine production 
as this transition moves forward  we expect to see declining mine production in manitoba in and in future years 
we have recently been relying upon  and will continue to rely upon  on an increasing basis  the availability of purchased intermediates to maintain manitoba s nickel production at around the  tonne annual level 
while we have entered into agreements and other arrangements to purchase intermediates to maintain manitoba s production levels at or near the  tonne annual level for the next few years  until the voisey s bay project would be producing intermediates in the form of concentrates for further processing at the manitoba and ontario operations  if suppliers of the purchased intermediates were to experience production problems or other disruptions  this could have a material adverse effect on our nickel production and results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
while we have certain potential new mine development projects at our existing operations in canada  if sufficient new low cost sources of nickel such as our voisey s bay and goro projects are not developed on a timely basis  our overall nickel production  particularly at our manitoba operations  could decline by  and our unit cost of production could increase significantly with any material decline in mine production from our canadian operations if such operations were not significantly restructured 
these developments could materially adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the level of production and capital and operating cost estimates relating to the goro project  the voisey s bay project and other projects of ours  which are used in establishing ore reserve estimates and for determining and obtaining financing and other purposes  are based on certain assumptions and are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
in the case of our goro project  as discussed under goro project suspension costs above  in december the principal firms providing project engineering  procurement and construction management services submitted information to us which  if confirmed  would indicate an increase in the capital cost estimate for the project in the range of to per cent above the current capital cost estimate of  million 
that information is currently under review by us but could result in a capital cost estimate substantially higher than the per cent increase in the estimate that we had indicated in the third quarter of could occur given the then current stage of project procurement and engineering 
since no engineering work to any significant degree has been undertaken on the voisey s bay project  the current capital cost estimates for the phases of our voisey s bay project  including the initial phase  have been based upon prefeasibility study estimates and are  accordingly  more preliminary than the current capital cost estimate for our goro project 
reference is made to outlook voisey s bay project below for the prefeasibility study estimates of the capital cost for the initial and subsequent phases of the voisey s bay project 
it is very likely that actual results for these projects will differ from our current estimates and assumptions  and these differences may be material 
in addition  experience from actual mining or processing operations may identify new or unexpected conditions which could reduce production below  and or increase capital and or operating costs above  our current estimates 
if actual results are less favourable than we currently estimate  such results could materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
governmental regulations in addition to environmental regulations referred to above  the mining and metals industry in canada operates under federal  provincial and municipal legislation  regulation and intervention by governments in such matters as land tenure  limitations on areas in which mining can be conducted  production rates  income and other taxes and the export of ore and other products  as well as other matters 
our operations in indonesia  the united kingdom  new caledonia and other countries outside canada are also subject to various environmental and other applicable laws and regulations and governmental interventions  some of which are similar to those in canada and all of which are subject to change 
the mining and metals industry is also subject to regulation and intervention by governments in such matters as control over the development and abandonment of mine sites including restrictions on production and possible expropriation or cancellation of contract and mineral rights 
before proceeding with major projects  including significant changes to existing operations  we must obtain regulatory approvals 
the regulatory approval process can involve stakeholder consultation  environmental impact assessments and public hearings  among other requirements 
in addition  regulatory approvals may be subject to conditions  including the obligation to post security deposits and other financial commitments 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals  or failure to obtain them on a timely basis  could result in delays and abandonment or restructuring of projects and increased costs  all of which could negatively affect our future earnings and cash flow 
in addition  such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions  and the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the mining and metals industry could increase our costs and have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with all applicable statutes or regulations at all times or that steps to bring us into compliance would not materially adversely impact our business or financial condition 
see environmental risks above 
capital requirements and operating risks as discussed under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources long term contractual obligations and commercial commitments above  each of our two current principal primary metals business units  the canadian and united kingdom operations and pt inco  has required  and is expected to continue to require  certain levels of investment to sustain their current levels of production 
for  as discussed under outlook planned capital expenditures  production and nickel unit cash cost of sales below  we currently forecast capital expenditures totalling approximately million  covering sustaining capital projects for our current primary metals business units as well as planned expenditures for our goro and voisey s bay projects and other development projects 
this total amount assumes a level of capital expenditures for our goro project of million  which may be higher or lower depending upon the results of the review process referred to under goro project suspension costs above and other developments  and million for our voisey s bay project  based upon the results of the bankable feasibility study which was completed in late march and other developments 
to meet such capital expenditure requirements  we must generate sufficient positive internal cash flow and or utilize available financing sources 
in addition  our mining operations and processing and related infrastructure facilities are subject to risks normally encountered in the mining and metals industry 
such risks include  without limitation  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  labour disputes  changes in laws  technical difficulties or failures  late delivery of supplies or equipment  unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures  cave ins  pit wall failures  rock falls  unanticipated ground  grade or water conditions  flooding  periodic or extended interruptions due to the unavailability of materials and force majeure events 
such risks could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or producing facilities  personal injury  environmental damage  delays in mining or processing  losses and possible legal liability 
any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at our mining or processing operations could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the wholesale electricity markets in ontario were deregulated for a portion of and as a result we experienced fluctuations in some of our electricity costs at the ontario operations 
depending upon future changes in the regulatory environment for these markets  we could experience future fluctuations in such costs 
we have from time to time experienced adverse production and production cost trends at our operations in canada and elsewhere and could experience similar adverse trends in the future 
labour relations collective agreements with unionized hourly production and maintenance workers at the ontario operations remain in effect until may  and a three year collective agreement with the unionized office  clerical and technical employees at the ontario operations remains in effect until march  on september   a new three year collective agreement with the unionized workers at the manitoba operations was successfully negotiated 
pt inco entered into a new two year collective labour agreement with its union on january  at goro  we currently have two unions representing some of our employees 
through an employer s association of which we are the controlling member  we have negotiated a collective agreement covering the construction phase of the voisey s bay project 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to have a positive relationship with our employees at our operations in canada and elsewhere or that new collective agreements will be entered into without work interruptions 
we could also be adversely affected by labour disruptions involving third parties who may provide us with goods or services at our operations in canada and elsewhere 
for example  as discussed under goro project suspension costs above  the goro project experienced labour disruptions by personnel associated with certain subcontractors in early september any lengthy work interruptions could materially adversely affect the timing of completion and the cost of the project  as well as our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
uncertainty of ore reserve estimates our reported ore reserves as of december  are estimated quantities of proven and probable ore that  under present and anticipated conditions  can be legally and economically mined and processed by the extraction of their mineral content 
we determine the amount of our ore reserves in accordance with the requirements of the applicable securities regulatory authorities and established industry practices 
the volume and grade of reserves actually recovered and rates of production from our present ore reserves may be less than geological measurements of the reserves 
furthermore  market price fluctuations in nickel  other metals and exchange rates  and changes in operating and capital costs may in the future render certain ore reserves uneconomic to mine and result in significant reductions in our reported estimates of proven and probable ore reserves 
no assurance can be given that the indicated amount of ore will be recovered or that it will be recovered at the rates anticipated by us 
our reserve estimates are based on limited sampling and  consequently  are uncertain because the samples may not be representative of the entire orebody 
as more knowledge and understanding of the orebody is obtained  the reserve estimates may change significantly  either positively or negatively 
critical accounting policies preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our ongoing evaluation of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our consolidated financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by us 
a summary of the significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include accounting for the impairment of property  plant and equipment  accounting for income and mining taxes and accounting for post retirement benefits 
property  plant and equipment we review and evaluate our property  plant and equipment and other assets for impairment when events or changes in economic and other circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
the net recoverable value of an asset is calculated by estimating undiscounted future net cash flows from the asset together with the asset s residual value 
future net cash flows are developed using assumptions that reflect the planned course of action for an asset given our best estimate of the most probable set of economic conditions 
evaluation of the future cash flows from major development projects such as the voisey s bay and goro projects entails a number of assumptions regarding project scope  the timing  receipt and terms of regulatory approvals  estimates of future metals prices  estimates of the ultimate size of the deposits  ore grades and recoverability  timing of commercial production  commercial viability of new technological processes  production volumes  operating and capital costs  and foreign currency exchange rates 
inherent in these assumptions are significant risks and uncertainties 
in our view  based on assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable  a reduction in the carrying value of our major development projects is not required at december  it is possible that events or changes in future economic conditions and other circumstances  and the resulting adverse impact on some or all of these assumptions  may require a significant reduction in the carrying value of our major development projects  in the related deferred income and mining tax liability and in shareholders equity 
additional information regarding our accounting for property  plant and equipment is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income and mining taxes the provision or relief for income and mining taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
the objectives of accounting for income and mining taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in determining both the current and future components of income and mining taxes  we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions as well as make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of future tax assets and liabilities 
if our interpretations differ from those of tax authorities or if the timing of reversals is not as anticipated  the provision or relief for income and mining taxes could increase or decrease in future periods 
additional information regarding our accounting for income and mining taxes is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
post retirement benefits the cost of providing benefits through defined benefit pension plans and post retirement benefits other than pensions is actuarially determined 
costs and obligations are dependent upon our assumptions related to future events that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
in addition  our actuarial consultants utilize subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to determine these factors 
the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could materially affect the amount of post retirements benefit expense and related liabilities 
additional information regarding our accounting for post retirement benefits is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting changes in effective january   we adopted  retroactively as a change in accounting policy  a new accounting standard of the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica in respect of earnings per share 
this new standard  which is consistent with united states gaap  changed the method in which diluted earnings per share are calculated 
the effect of this change is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also effective january   we adopted  retroactively as a change in accounting policy  a new accounting standard of the cica in respect of stock based compensation and other stock based payments 
this new standard  which substantially conforms to united states gaap  requires either the recognition of a compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments to employees or  alternatively  the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share data as if stock based compensation had been recognized in earnings 
the effect of this change is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also effective january   we adopted  retroactively  a new accounting standard of the cica in respect of interim financial statements 
as a consequence  we changed our accounting policy  for interim reporting purposes only  in connection with the timing of recognizing the costs associated with planned annual shutdown of operations for maintenance 
previously  these costs were expensed evenly over the year whereas under the new standard such costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
the effect of this change is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also adopted  for united states reporting purposes  certain united states standards relating to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january  the effect of adopting these standards is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting changes in effective january   we adopted a new standard of the cica in respect of foreign currency translation  which conforms substantially to united states gaap  that eliminates the deferral and amortization of currency translation adjustments related to long term monetary items with a fixed and ascertainable life 
the effect of adopting this standard is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted new standards of the cica in respect of business combinations and goodwill for canadian reporting purposes 
these standards conform substantially to new united states standards  which we also adopted for united states reporting purposes commencing in the first quarter of also effective january   we adopted a new united states standard in respect of accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets for united states reporting purposes 
the adoption of these standards had no significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
effective july   we adopted  for united states reporting purposes  a new standard that amended existing authoritative pronouncements relating to the accounting for the extinguishment of debt 
the adoption of the new standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
effective december   we adopted  for united states reporting purposes  a new interpretation that clarifies the requirements for disclosure of certain types of guarantees 
the interpretation also requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
effective december   we adopted  for united states reporting purposes  a new interpretation that addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities and provides guidance with respect to the disclosure of such entities 
there was no significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of the adoption of this interpretation 
accounting changes in we will adopt  for united states reporting purposes commencing in the first quarter of  a new standard relating to the accounting for costs associated with the exit from or disposal of a business 
this standard requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred provided that such fair value can be reasonably estimated 
an exception applies for certain one time termination benefits that are incurred over time 
the adoption of the new standard will not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  we will be adopting a new united states standard in respect of accounting for asset retirement obligations for united states reporting purposes commencing in the first quarter of this standard requires that a liability for retirement obligations be recognized when incurred and recorded at fair value 
the effect of adopting this standard is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  for canadian and united states reporting purposes  we will change the accounting for stock based compensation from the intrinsic value method to one that recognizes in earnings the cost of stock based compensation based on the estimated fair value of new stock options granted to employees in and in future years 
the effect of this change in accounting policy is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we will adopt a new accounting standard of the cica in respect of the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which substantially conforms to united states gaap 
the adoption of the new standard will not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
accounting changes in we will be adopting new accounting guidelines issued by the cica in respect of hedging relationships for canadian reporting purposes 
the new guidelines will be applied commencing with hedging relationships outstanding on january  we do not anticipate that the new guidelines will have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
other information reference is made to investor information for certain information on governmental and other policies and factors affecting our operations and investments by non canadians in our securities 
reference is also made to quarterly financial information for our quarterly net sales  net earnings and earnings per share data for and outlook we continue to pursue our goal of being the world s most profitable nickel producer through our three part strategy of maintaining strong low cost operations focused on high margin production  pursuing profitable growth  and enhancing our strong global marketing position  including the development and sale of value added products 
our two major development projects  goro and voisey s bay  are currently expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
goro project in  we made progress on the commercial development of our goro project in new caledonia 
the project is expected to consist of a fully integrated mining and processing facility with a planned annual capacity of approximately  tonnes of nickel and  tonnes of cobalt 
the operation is expected to supply stainless steel customers in south korea  taiwan and eventually china 
the goro property has an extensive laterite resource base  including an initial mining zone with proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes which has been outlined as an initial source of feed for a commercial plant 
this ore reserve base can be mined using low cost open pit methods  which  when combined with our proprietary pressure acid leaching and solvent extraction pal sx technology  gives the project the potential to have one of the lowest cash costs of nickel production in the world 
the new caledonian authorities enacted a fiscal regime in which provides a year tax holiday plus an additional five years at tax rates that are per cent of the prevailing tax rates for metallurgical companies 
in addition  as discussed below we received a commitment of million covering financing of qualifying goro project expenditures under a program sponsored by the french government to provide financial support for investments in french overseas territories such as new caledonia 
in  we completed the construction of an integrated pilot plant in new caledonia capable of processing tonnes of ore per day to continue with the development of the pal sx technology required for commercialization 
the pilot plant operated successfully for over two years  both in further proving the pal sx technology and in training the core workforce for a future commercial plant 
we undertook an update process in september covering a number of key aspects of the project  including the project s capital cost estimate and schedule 
as noted above under goro project suspension costs  on december  we announced a plan to undertake a comprehensive review of all key aspects of the goro project after the principal firms providing project engineering  procurement and construction management services had submitted information which  if confirmed  would indicate an increase in the capital cost estimate for the project in the range of to per cent above the then current capital cost estimate of  million 
the objective of this review is to assess all information on the project  including the various cost estimates and trends  and determine what changes in the capital cost estimate and the project can be made to maintain the project s economic feasibility 
the review of the capital cost estimate will cover what downward adjustments can be made in such estimate through scope or design changes  modifications to construction and related plans and civil and other contractual arrangements  and alternative project execution strategies 
since that announcement  we have been evaluating what onsite and offsite work should be curtailed or stopped and what work should be continued while this review is ongoing 
based upon this ongoing evaluation  we have also been reviewing various contractual and other arrangements covering construction and other work relating to the goro project and implementing certain actions to suspend or terminate certain of those contractual arrangements 
these actions  as noted under goro project suspension costs above  resulted in an after tax charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter of as of december   we had spent approximately million on the goro project since july  when this project was formally launched 
this amount excludes a current estimate of approximately million that would still have to be spent for equipment  services and other requirements under existing contracts and commitments  and accruals of approximately million relating to such requirements as of year end  most of which is expected to have value for the project 
the project review process is still in its preliminary stages given its planned scope 
we do not currently expect to be in a position to report on the results of this review  including an updated capital cost estimate for the project and the additional effect  if any  that this review could have on our financial results  until at least the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter of we have been working with various parties to assist us in the review process 
while the key objective of this comprehensive review is to implement such actions and steps  if required  to have a project that will meet an acceptable rate of return on the investment to be made in this project  if  upon completion of the review  we were to conclude that the goro project could not be restructured to meet our rate of return on investment requirements  we would likely write off all or a substantial portion of the carrying value of the goro project and we would also lose the expected future production from goro 
such a result would have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
we have continued our discussions with the japanese consortium to be led by sumitomo metal mining co  ltd 
concerning their continuing interest in acquiring a per cent interest in the goro project 
we have applied for the deferral of million in financing under the french government s paul act program that this government was prepared to provide to the goro project in and we have continued to work with the new caledonian and french governments on the permitting and certain other requirements relating to the project 
voisey s bay project we made significant progress during in the implementation of agreements with stakeholders for the commercial development of the voisey s bay nickel copper cobalt deposits in labrador 
in early october  we entered into definitive agreements with the province of newfoundland and labrador  intended to implement the terms of a non binding statement of principles entered into in june  covering the commercial development of the voisey s bay deposits 
the voisey s bay ore deposits include million tonnes of estimated proven and probable mineral reserves in the ovoid deposit  which can be mined using open pit mining methods 
these proven and probable mineral reserves have an estimated average grade of per cent nickel  per cent copper and per cent cobalt 
consistent with the terms and conditions of the non binding statement of principles  the definitive agreements entered into in october set forth the development of a mine and concentrator processing plant at voisey s bay  a research and development program focusing on hydrometallurgical processing technology  including a demonstration plant at argentia  newfoundland  an industrial and employment benefits program for the voisey s bay project  a timetable for the start and completion of the principal stages of the project  and other key parts and requirements covering the overall development of the voisey s bay project 
under the terms of the definitive agreements  certain provisions became effective when these agreements were executed 
the next steps to be met by the end of the first quarter of for these agreements to become effective overall include the securing of acceptable financing arrangements for the project 
certain of the other previously identified conditions to be met before the voisey s bay project could proceed  including the execution of impacts and benefits agreements with the labrador inuit association and innu nation  were met in we began infrastructure  site development and other work in july as part of our initial investment in the province with respect to this project of approximately million over the july march period 
our current capital cost estimate  based upon the bankable feasibility study which was completed in late march  for the first phase of the development of voisey s bay involves total capital expenditures of approximately million 
we currently expect initial concentrate production from this first phase in for shipment to the ontario and manitoba operations while the hydrometallurgical process is tested in the planned demonstration plant 
assuming technical and economic feasibility  a commercial hydrometallurgical processing plant will be built as part of phase two of the project between and in the unlikely event that the hydrometallurgical process proves not to be technically and or economically feasible  a conventional refinery will be built to produce a finished nickel product 
it is currently expected that the voisey s bay hydrometallurgical plant will produce approximately  tonnes of nickel   tonnes of cobalt  up to  tonnes of copper intermediates  and  tonnes of copper concentrate annually 
a total investment  based upon the updated capital cost estimate for the initial phase and the prefeasibility studies for the other two phases of the project  of approximately  million would be required for all phases of the project over the year life of the project  including estimated sustaining capital 
the focus of the voisey s bay project for will include the preparation of a clear project development plan and assembling a first class project development team 
a number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the commercial development of the goro and voisey s bay projects  including political  regulatory  design  construction  operating and financing risks  as discussed under risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties above 
existing operations as we move towards the realization of our growth plans  we will continue to seek to maximize the contribution to the financial results of our existing operations 
we experienced in the fourth quarter of upward pressures on certain costs 
the sources of such pressures included i increased pension and energy costs and ii higher costs in the manitoba operations where we have been seeking to address lower ore grades and lower mine production  more complex mining zones and certain technology issues associated with the blending of ores with relatively high mgo levels 
lower price realizations for our platinum group metals products as current hedges covering such realizations entered into in and expire and increased expenses associated with the voisey s bay and goro projects which are not being capitalized also adversely affected costs 
in addition  we do not expect to maintain for at least the first nine months of the level of production of platinum group metals achieved in  thus limiting by product credits in that offset some of these cost increases 
at pt inco  we currently expect costs to increase due to higher energy  employment  supplies and services expenses 
consumption of fuel oil at pt inco is expected to increase in in order to meet its goal of producing an additional  tonnes of nickel in matte 
supplies and services are also projected to increase due to higher equipment hours to haul ore and overburden over greater distances 
higher labour costs from the recently negotiated two year agreement are also expected to contribute to increased costs 
we shall be seeking ways to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through cost reduction initiatives and maximizing lower cost hydroelectric power usage while minimizing fuel oil consumption 
our goal is to strengthen the performance of our operations and deal effectively with the short term cost challenges we are currently facing  as well as enhance the efficiency and productivity of our business 
despite the cost increases in our existing operations in areas such as pensions  energy and the impact of lower production of and realized prices for platinum group metals  productivity and safety continue to improve 
productivity improvements are helping to offset some of the cost challenges 
in  our productivity efforts are expected to include improving nickel and copper separation at the matte processing plant at the ontario operations to enhance this process from per cent in to per cent in this improved separation is projected to eliminate significant recycles from downstream processes and allow us to reduce in process inventory of platinum group metals 
improved nickel recoveries resulting from design changes at the clarabelle mill at the ontario operations are expected to continue in collaborative efforts at our refinery tankhouse at the manitoba operations improved the recovery of higher margin plating grade cathode from per cent to over per cent in and we believe this improvement can be sustained 
planned capital expenditures  production and nickel unit cash cost of sales our capital expenditures are currently expected to total million  including  as discussed under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources above  approximately million for the voisey s bay project  approximately million for the goro project and approximately million in sustaining capital expenditures for existing operations  of which about million will be required for environmental measures and new mine development in canada 
depreciation expense is projected to be million in our nickel production is currently expected to be approximately  tonnes  up two per cent from  tonnes in we expect purchased intermediates to increase by over per cent from levels to approximately  tonnes in  representing per cent of planned finished nickel production  up from  tonnes in we use purchased intermediates to increase the processing capacity utilization of our ontario and manitoba operations and  as discussed under risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties above  to maintain nickel production at the manitoba operations at or near its  tonne annual level 
while such use is profitable  it does increase our costs  particularly at higher nickel prices since the cost of purchased intermediates is based on prevailing lme prices 
copper production is currently expected to be approximately  tonnes in  up slightly from  tonnes in total production of platinum group metals is expected to decline to  troy ounces in as the copper cliff north orebody at the ontario operations nears depletion 
our nickel unit cash cost of sales after by product credits for is currently projected to be in the range of  to  per tonne to per pound 
the increase in such costs over reflects anticipated lower by product credits  principally due to lower production of and realized prices for platinum group metals  increased pension expense  lower ore grades in the ontario and manitoba operations and higher energy costs  resulting from increased consumption of and prices paid for fuel oil to enable higher production at pt inco and higher costs for natural gas at the ontario operations 
our policy continues to be that we do not publicly forecast where nickel and other metals prices will be given the historic volatility in these prices and the level of economic uncertainty that currently exists in at least some of our key geographic markets 
the premium we expect to realize over the lme cash nickel price for is in the range of to per tonne to cents per pound 
nickel market conditions stainless steel demand has grown by almost six per cent annually for more than years  including the past decade  and we have seen no signs that such growth will be slowing down during at least the next few years 
the stainless steel industry  the principal end use market for nickel  has been making significant investments to increase capacity and stainless steel demand growth and production is currently expected to be strong over at least the next few years supported by the continued expected strong demand in china 
the combination of china s stainless steel demand growth and nickel demand growth in accounted for more than two thirds of the overall increase in western world plus china nickel demand for with most nickel producers operating at or near capacity in and taking into account that there currently exists limited shutdown capacity available to be restarted  and with the latest round of current expansions to existing production capacity coming to an end  we currently estimate that there will be a limited amount of additional nickel supply prior to to meet any expected growth in demand 
nickel demand in is currently anticipated to be relatively strong for several reasons 
first  more than three million tonnes of stainless steel capacity has been  or will be  commissioned in and  with about million tonnes of additional production expected from this new capacity in second  chinese nickel demand has continued to grow during the last two years  even when western world economic growth was essentially flat or declining 
third  reported nickel inventories  both producer and lme  are at very low levels relative to prior nickel cycles 
inventory levels at december  represented approximately weeks of demand  which is considered very low 
fourth  the availability of nickel containing stainless steel scrap  as an alternative source of nickel for the stainless steel industry  is currently expected to be tighter in than in due to continued low levels of such scrap from russia  continued growth in consumption of such scrap by chinese mini mills  and the current projected increase in stainless steel production 
we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward looking statements in this report to reflect events that may occur or circumstances that may change after the date hereof 
issuances of convertible debentures in march in early march  we issued and sold i million aggregate amount payable at maturity of convertible debentures due march  convertible debentures  representing million in gross proceeds to us  and ii million aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures due march  subordinated convertible debentures 
each convertible debenture was offered and sold at a price of and bears a semi annual cash interest coupon equal to approximately per cent per year on the issue price equivalent to per cent per year on the  amount per convertible debenture payable at maturity 
the subordinated convertible debentures were offered and sold at their stated principal amount  per subordinated convertible debenture and bear a semi annual cash interest coupon equal to per cent per year  subject to our right to defer interest payments thereon for up to five years

the net proceeds from the concurrent offerings are expected to enable us to redeem all or a portion of either or both of i our series e preferred shares having a million aggregate liquidation preference and which are subject to mandatory redemption in and or ii million aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures due and  accordingly  reduce our fixed charges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
given the nature of the company s business and operations  the areas of highest exposure are nickel prices and  to a lesser extent  other metals and commodity prices metals and commodities risk  foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange risk  and interest rates interest rate risk 
in the case of metals and commodities risks  the company sells its products at prices based on world market prices and purchases fuel oil and other supplies at market prices for these commodities 
while prices for the company s primary nickel and other metals produced are based largely on  and sold in  us dollars  the company is subject to foreign exchange risk because it incurs a substantial portion of its costs in currencies other than the us dollar  in particular in the canadian dollar 
the company is exposed to additional foreign exchange risk and is also exposed to interest rate risk because it funds its operations and capital expenditures largely through long term and short term borrowings in us dollars 
based upon past movements of certain foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as described below  and the company s current expectations of changes in such exchange rates and interest rates for  the company believes that the potential near term impact on its future earnings and cash flows with respect to foreign currency and interest rate risks will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition 
the metals and commodity risk relating to nickel and other metals produced by the company  given the significance of price realizations to the company of such metals  is expected to continue to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
the company has engaged in transactions to reduce the impact of certain of these market risks to which it is exposed to a significant degree on earnings and cash flows 
the company has established policies and procedures governing the use of derivative instruments to address certain market risks 
these policies and procedures are intended to reduce certain of the uncertainties associated with the market risks specific to the company s business and operations and reduce the effect of market fluctuations on its earnings and cash flows 
the company does not use these instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company only uses derivative instruments based on an economic analysis of the underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse effects on future earnings and cash flows due to fluctuations in metals and commodities prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates will be offset by proceeds from  and changes in the fair value of  the derivative instruments 
the company does not  however  hedge its exposure to all market risks and does not hedge it exposure to any market risk in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flows 
the nickel market and other markets for metals produced by the company are global in nature and are influenced by  among other things  both global and regional supply and demand factors 
the company s policy with respect to nickel has been to be exposed to the market risks for nickel produced and sold by the company except in certain situations 
these situations normally cover i sales of inco source nickel to customers where delivery is generally to be made three or more months in the future and ii purchases by the company of nickel from other sources to meet its customer requirements 
in these situations the company will enter into derivative commodity instruments representing either forward purchase contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations with respect to such future sales of inco source nickel or forward sale contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations with respect to purchased nickel 
metals and other commodities price risk the company is subject to metals and commodities risk because the company sells its products and purchases its fuel oil and other supplies at prices effectively determined through trading on major commodity exchanges  notably the lme and the new york mercantile exchange 
the prices offered on these exchanges generally reflect the global balance of supply and demand for a particular commodity but are also influenced by such factors as investment funds flow  speculative activity and currency exchange rates 
the price of nickel  the company s principal product  was the major factor influencing operating earnings and cash flows for the years ended december  and and and for prior years 
inco s selling price for primary nickel is generally based on the lme cash nickel price 
however  certain of the company s products are customarily sold at a premium over the lme cash price  particularly inco s special products such as nickel powders and foams 
the markets for the company s products have been  and are expected to continue to be  cyclical in nature and prices are volatile 
however  because the company is one of the largest producers and marketers of primary nickel in the world  it has chosen  subject to certain limited exceptions  not to hedge or otherwise attempt to mitigate to any significant degree the risk of fluctuations in the price of nickel 
the company reviews this policy from time to time and may increase the currently limited use of derivative instruments to reduce such risks in the future 
although the company has generally not hedged the risk of fluctuations in the price of nickel  it does hedge this risk with respect to i sales of inco source nickel to customers for delivery three or more months into the future and ii purchases by the company of nickel from third parties to meet its customers requirements 
in these situations  the company will enter into derivative commodity instruments representing either forward purchase contracts to hedge the risk of price fluctuations with respect to forwards sales of inco source nickel or forward sale contracts to hedge the risk of price fluctuations with respect to purchased nickel 
in the case of other metals produced by the company  the company has from time to time entered into derivative instruments to establish minimum prices 
at december   the company had outstanding lme forward contracts to purchase  tonnes of nickel in at prices averaging  per tonne per pound  tonnes in at prices averaging  per tonne per pound and tonnes in at prices averaging  per tonne per pound 
at december   the company had outstanding lme forward contracts to purchase  tonnes of nickel in at prices averaging  per tonne per pound and a further  tonnes in at prices averaging  per tonne per pound 
the total quantities of nickel outstanding under these lme forward purchase contracts outstanding at december  which were for purchases in represented three per cent of the company s projected nickel deliveries for  and the total quantities outstanding at december  which were for purchases in represented seven per cent of the company s projected nickel deliveries for depending on market conditions  the company enters into precious metals contracts with various financial counterparties 
these contracts are intended to provide certain minimum price realizations in respect of a portion of the company s future production 
at december   the company had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of palladium during and  troy ounces in under these swap contracts  the company receives fixed prices averaging per troy ounce in and per troy ounce in and pays a floating price 
at december   the company had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of palladium during and a further  troy ounces during under these swap contracts  the company receives fixed prices averaging per troy ounce in and per troy ounce in and pays a floating price 
at december   the company had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of platinum during and  troy ounces during under these swap contracts  the company receives fixed prices averaging per troy ounce in and per troy ounce in and pays a floating price 
at december   the company had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of platinum during and a further  troy ounces during under these swap contracts  the company receives fixed prices averaging per troy ounce in and per troy ounce in and pays a floating price 
the company s indonesian subsidiary  pt inco  uses oil swap contracts to hedge the effect of price changes in respect of a portion of its energy requirements in indonesia which are met in the form of fuel oil products 
under such contracts  the company receives or makes payments based on the difference between a fixed and a floating price for fuel oil 
at december   the company had swap contracts with a financial institution to exchange payments on  tonnes of fuel oil during and  tonnes during  representing about per cent and seven per cent  respectively  of pt inco s estimated fuel oil requirements for those years 
under these swap contracts  the company pays fixed prices averaging per tonne in and per tonne in and receives a floating price 
at december   the company had swap contracts with a financial institution to exchange payments on  tonnes of fuel oil during and  tonnes during  representing about per cent and per cent  respectively  of pt inco s estimated fuel oil requirements for those years 
under these swap contracts  the company pays fixed prices averaging per tonne in and per tonne in and receives a floating price 
foreign exchange risk by virtue of its international operations  the company conducts business in a number of foreign currencies other than the us dollar 
these exchange rates have varied substantially in the last three years 
a substantial portion of the company s revenue is received in us dollars since the price of nickel and other metals produced are generally referenced in us dollars  while a significant portion of its costs and expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar and between the us dollar and other currencies will give rise to foreign currency exposure  either favourable or unfavourable  which have materially affected and are expected to continue to impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s primary foreign exchange risk is to changes in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
the company reduces  from time to time  the impact of this risk by entering into forward currency contracts and foreign currency options 
at the end of  these contracts took the form of forward contracts  which establish a fixed exchange rate for the canadian dollar  and forward currency contracts that establish a fixed price for the future purchase of certain currencies in connection with the goro project 
at december   these contracts took the form of range forward contracts  which effectively establish a minimum and maximum exchange rate for the canadian dollar  and forward currency contracts that establish a fixed price for the future purchase of certain currencies in connection with its goro project 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase cdn 
million in at an average price of 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase cdn

at december   the company also had outstanding currency call option contracts  giving it the right  but not the obligation  to purchase cdn 
million at an average rate to us dollars of in the first three months of  and outstanding currency put option contracts  giving the buyer the right  but not the obligation  to sell to the company cdn 
million at an average rate to us dollars of in the first three months of the purpose of the company s canadian dollar hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual us dollar cash flows relating to a portion of its future canadian production costs will be adversely affected by an appreciation of the canadian dollar 
the foreign currency contracts outstanding at december  represent approximately one per cent of the company s total estimated canadian production costs for at december   the company had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase aus 
million in at an average price of and aus 
million in at an average price of  and eur million in at an average price of and eur million in at an average price of 
the purpose of the company s australian dollar and euro forward currency contracts is to hedge a portion of the planned construction costs of the goro project in new caledonia 
most of these forward currency contracts for were closed out in early january  resulting in pre tax hedging gains of million  since they no longer matched the timing of the planned expenditures due to the expected deferral of those expenditures as a result of the review of the goro project 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase aus 
million in at an average price of and aus 
million in at an average price of  eur million in at an average price of and eur million in at an average price of the company is  to a substantially lesser extent  subject to fluctuations in the value of the indonesian rupiah relative to the us dollar from its operations in indonesia 
this reduced impact is due to a significant portion of pt inco s costs and revenues being effectively denominated in us dollars 
because of the limited nature of this exposure  the company does not customarily hedge the value of the rupiah against the us dollar and no such financial instruments were in effect at december  or the company does not engage in any significant foreign currency activities which have not been specifically identified as hedges 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from investing and borrowing activities undertaken to manage its liquidity and capital requirements 
the company has generally used fixed rate debt to finance long term investments  while variable rate debt has been used to meet working capital and related requirements on a more near term basis 
at december   approximately per cent of the company s total debt  or million  was subject to variable interest rates 
based on the level of variable rate debt at december   the impact of a per cent change in interest rates  or basis points  would change interest expense by less than million over a full year 
such fair value was determined based on the discounted values of their related cash flows 
the sensitivity analysis associated with such fair value does not consider the impact of changes in the company s common share price on the fair value of its convertible debt or the conversion of such convertible debt 
the change in other long term debt is not material to the company s financial position 
at the end of  the company had an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of million intended to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of its fixed rate debt 
this interest rate swap effectively changes the company s exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of its fixed rate debt to a floating rate 
the company expects to issue significant amounts of additional debt in the future to finance its development projects and for other purposes and  accordingly  could be materially adversely affected by changes in interest rates in the future despite any interest rate swaps the company then might have in effect 
sensitivities in evaluating the effects of changes in metals and commodities prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on its business and operations  the company uses a sensitivity analysis as its primary analytical technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that certain market risks may have on future earnings and cash flows 
each analysis assumes simultaneous changes or variations in each rate or price which is intended to quantify the impact of such changes on the company s earnings  cash flows  and fair values of assets and liabilities during a one year period while holding all other factors constant except for each of the particular items of exposure which is varied 
the range of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflects the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and prices chosen 
as noted above  the company s financial results are sensitive to  among other things  changes in prices for nickel and other metals  commodities prices  the canadian us dollar exchange rate  and interest rates 
the financial results are also affected by changes in the indonesian rupiah us dollar exchange rate  but to a lesser extent as pt inco s revenues and many of its expenses are denominated in us dollars 
the following table indicates the approximate full year impact on net earnings per common share  based on planned deliveries of inco source metals and after taking into consideration the principal derivative instrument positions as of december   of the hypothetical changes shown for each of the company s principal market risk exposures  and the after tax impact of the changes indicated on the company s market risk sensitive instruments sensitivities change in amount impact on basic earnings per common share after tax impact on market risk sensitive instruments realized prices for nickel per tonne million copper per tonne cobalt  per tonne platinum per troy ounce million palladium per troy ounce million fuel oil per tonne million natural gas per mm btu us per cdn

risk of non performance associated with derivative contracts the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties in connection with its derivative instruments 
the company does not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative financial instruments subject to credit risk but mitigates such credit risk by dealing only with  based upon its analysis and other data  financially sound counterparties and  accordingly  does not anticipate loss for non performance 
there is no substantial concentration of credit risk resulting from these instruments 
the company s hedging activities are intended to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in the price of certain metals  fuel oil  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for a period of time in the future 
although hedging transactions may protect the company against adverse movements in such prices or rates  they may also limit the price  interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate that the company receives on hedged transactions  resulting in the company foregoing potential realization of additional revenue 
forward looking statements the estimated impact of changes in the price of various metals and other commodities  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates included in the foregoing market risk discussion are forward looking statements as defined in the us securities and exchange act of the actual impact of such changes is likely to differ  and may differ materially  from the estimates included in this discussion 
such estimates are based on a number of assumptions which may prove incorrect  including  but not limited to  assumptions about the relevant commodity  currency and credit markets  including markets in indonesia and other countries in the far east and europe 
in addition  these estimates do not take into account the collateral effects of the events causing the changes in the price of the various metals  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the estimates provided should not be considered projections of future events or results
