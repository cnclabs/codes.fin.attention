item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenues from the sale of oil and gas in the period delivered 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables we judge unlikely to be collected 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
leasehold costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties are assessed periodically within specific geographic areas and impairments in value are charged to expense 
exploratory expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized  but charged to expense if the well is determined to be unsuccessful 
costs of productive wells  unsuccessful developmental wells and productive leases are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis through depletion  depreciation and amortization expense over the life of the associated oil and gas reserves 
oil and gas property costs are periodically evaluated for possible impairment 
impairments are recorded when management believes that a property s net book value is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected future cash flows 
depletion  depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties and the periodic assessments for impairment are based on underlying oil and gas reserve estimates and future cash flows using then current oil and gas prices combined with operating and capital development costs 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the company regularly enters into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
the contracts  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties which management believes to be of high credit quality  may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
the oil and gas reference prices of these contracts are based upon oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the company 
currently  the company s oil and gas swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges

however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of production and oil and gas prices  and there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
the company believes that borrowings available under its credit agreement  projected operating cash flows and the cash on hand will be sufficient to cover its working capital  capital expenditures  planned development activities and debt service requirements for the next months 
in connection with consummating any significant acquisition  additional debt or equity financing will be required  which may or may not be available on terms that are acceptable to the company

hedging the company regularly enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact on its operations of fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
all such contracts are entered into solely to hedge prices and limit volatility 
the company s current policy is to hedge between and of its production  when futures prices justify  on a rolling twelve to twenty four month basis

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for oil and spot prices applicable to the rocky mountain and mid continent regions for its natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
natural gas price realizations during  exclusive of any hedges  ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf 
oil prices  exclusive of any hedges  ranged from a monthly low of per barrel to a monthly high of per barrel during oil and gas prices have increased significantly from late and early levels 
a significant decline in prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in  a reduction in oil and gas prices  excluding oil and gas quantities that were fixed through hedging transactions  would have reduced revenues by million 
if oil and gas future prices at december  had declined by  the unrealized hedging gains at that date would have increased by million from million to million 
the company regularly enters into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
the contracts  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties which management believes to be of high credit quality  may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
the oil and gas reference prices of these contracts are based upon oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the company 
currently  the company s oil and gas swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
the company entered into various swap contracts for oil based on nymex prices  recognizing losses of million and million in and  respectively  and a gain of million in  related to these contracts 
the company entered into various swap contracts for natural gas based on the colorado interstate gas cig index  recognizing a loss of million in  and gains of million and million in and  respectively  related to these contracts 
at december   the company was a party to swap contracts for oil based on nymex prices covering approximately  barrels of oil per day for at fixed prices ranging from to per barrel 
these swaps are summarized in the table below 
the overall weighted average hedged price for the swap contracts is per barrel for the company also entered into swap contracts for oil for as of december   which are summarized in the table below 
the unrealized losses on these contracts totaled million based on nymex futures prices at december  at december   the company was a party to swap contracts for natural gas based on cig and anr index prices covering approximately  mmbtu s and  mmbtu s per day  respectively  for at fixed prices ranging from to per mmbtu based on cig and from to per mmbtu based on anr 
the overall weighted average hedged price for the swap contracts is per mmbtu for the company also entered into natural gas swap contracts for and as of december   which are summarized in the table below

the realized price of the company s gas and that of other rocky mountain producers has historically traded at a discount to nymex gas 
this discount is referred to as a basis differential and averaged per mmbtu in  ranging from a positive differential of per mmbtu in february to a negative differential of per mmbtu in july the cig basis differential for averaged per mmbtu discount from nymex  ranging from a discount of per mmbtu in january to a discount of per mmbtu in october based on futures prices as of february  the basis differential for averages a per mmbtu discount  ranging from a discount of per mmbtu in february to a discount of per mmbtu in december the significant increase in the cig basis differential is due to the warmer than usual winter in late resulting in less local heating demand and a corresponding increase in gas held in storage due to the limited pipeline capacity for transportation out of the rocky mountain region 
as evidenced by the futures prices  the differential is expected to shrink as additional pipeline capacity out of the rockies is expected to be available in may kern river expansion of mmbtu per day combined with expectations for more normalized winter weather in the region 
interest rate risk at december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility with an average interest rate of and million net to patina outstanding under its elysium credit facility with an average interest rate of 
the company may elect that all or a portion of the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to i the eurodollar rate for one  two  three or six months plus a margin which fluctuates from to on the patina facility or to on the elysium facility or ii the prime rate plus a margin which fluctuates from to on the patina facility or to on the elysium facility 
the weighted average interest rates under the patina and elysium facilities approximated and  respectively during assuming no change in the amount outstanding at december   the annual impact on interest expense of a ten percent change in the average interest rate would be approximately  net of tax 
as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value
