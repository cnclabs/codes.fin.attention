critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the reserve for loan losses  investment and intangible asset values  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
capital bank records estimated loan loss reserves based on known problem loans and estimated deficiencies in the existing loan portfolio 
the reserve calculation takes into account historic write off trends and current market and economic conditions 
if economic conditions were to decline significantly or the financial condition of the bank s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves may be required 

the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions and associated market values of investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 

the company assesses the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers anticipated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for the valuation allowance which  at this time  it deems not to be necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

the company accounts for all business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  net assets acquired are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition  as such  the historical costs basis of individual assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect their fair value 

goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level 
identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value 

long lived assets  including identified intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
such evaluations are based on undiscounted cash flow projections 
the disposal of long lived assets is measured based on the lower of the book or fair value less the costs to sell 
results of operations 
capital bank corporation reported net income of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a fully diluted per share basis  net income for   and was  
and  respectively 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between total interest income and total interest expense and is the company s principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is determined by the volume of interest earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  and the volume and cost of supporting funds 
net interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
net interest income increased between and by  or from the amount of million 
increases during both periods are primarily due to significant increases in the volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities as the bank has experienced rapid growth both internally and through acquisition 
the increases for both years were negatively affected by a rapid and significant decline in market rates during during  the prime rate dropped from in january to in december with a decline in rates of at least basis points in every month of except july as the federal reserve made separate moves to reduce interest rates in efforts to stimulate the economy 
in  the federal reserve held interest rates steady for a majority of the year  but made one move in november that resulted in an additional basis point drop in the prime rate to 
though rates remained somewhat steady during  net interest income was affected by an entire year of the lower rates put in place during since the bank s loan portfolio adjusted with prime at a faster rate than the deposit portfolio  the rapidly declining rate environment had a negative effect on net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest margin is the total of net interest income divided by average earning assets 
average earning assets in were million  up when compared to million for the net interest margin was in  a basis point rise from the net interest margin of 
net interest spread was and for and  respectively 
interest income increased in to million from million in the amount recorded in represented a increase from the million earned in for each year  this increase is primarily due to the significant growth in the company s loan portfolio 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was  a decline of basis points from the yield of 
the average yield for was down basis points from in the decreases in average yield during and were primarily attributable to the overall decline in market rates as explained above 
the average loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets was in  up from the average balances of loans  which had yields of and for and  respectively  increased from million in to million in the average balances of federal funds and other short term investments grew from million in to million in  but the average yield in this category dropped basis points from to over the same time period 
investment yield decreased from in to in this decrease also reflects the results of the decline in market rates over the last two years 
the yield on investments increased during as compared to the yield of 
this increase was attributable to a large number of federal agency bonds with high yields that were purchased at discounts in previous years being called during by the various agencies associated with the investment 
when those bonds were called  the associated discounts were taken into income as yield adjustments 
during  investments with a par value of million were called with  in discounts remaining at call date  all of which was taken into income as yield adjustments 
interest expense increased in to million from the million recorded during the balance reflected a increase from the million expensed in this increase is primarily due to a significant increase in average interest bearing deposits  which went from million in to million in to million in the average rates on interest bearing deposits decreased from in to in the decrease in average rates during is reflective of the overall decrease in market rates offered during as compared to the previous year 
as previously mentioned  the bank s loan portfolio adjusted with prime at a faster rate than the deposit portfolio as a result of the federal reserve s actions to decrease interest rates in much of the effect of their actions on the deposit portfolio took place in in particular  the average rate on time deposits  which represented of all interest bearing liabilities during  dropped basis points from in to in the following two tables set forth certain information regarding the company s yield on interest earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities and the component changes in net interest income 
the first table reflects the company s effective yield on earning assets and cost of funds 
yields and costs are computed by dividing income or expense for the year by the respective daily average asset or liability balance 
changes in net interest income from year to year can be explained in terms of fluctuations in volume and rate 
the second table presents information on those changes

the provision for loan losses is the amount charged against earnings for the purpose of establishing an adequate allowance for probable loan losses 
loan losses are  in turn  charged to this allowance rather than being reported as a direct expense 
in  and  amounts expensed as loan loss provisions were million  million  and million  respectively 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is established based on management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as delinquency rates and current market conditions 
this estimate is regularly reviewed and modified  as necessary 
loans of  or more are subject to specific review for impairment in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million on december  and  respectively  and represented approximately and of total loans outstanding on those dates 
the company experienced higher loan charge offs during when compared to previous years 
management believes that this is due in part to a weakened economy 
during  the company charged off million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
of that amount  million related to four business customer relationships 
during  the company charged off  in loans  net of  in recoveries 
charge offs in amounted to  net of  in recoveries 
management has allocated the allowance for loan losses by category 
this allocation is based on management s assessment of the risk associated with the different types of lending activities 
at december  allowance of loans to allowance of loans to dollars in thousands amount total loan amount total loans commercial   consumer  residential mortgages equity lines unallocated the following table shows changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off by loan category and additions to the allowance which have been charged to operating expenses

non interest income was million  million  and million for years ended december    and  respectively 
the increases for those periods as a percentage of the prior year s amounts are for and for the increases in non interest income for and are primarily attributable to increases in fees associated with deposit accounts and a large increase in fees associated with the company s mortgage loan origination activities 
the large increase in fees associated with the mortgage loan origination activities was a direct result of attractive mortgage rates during due to the lower interest rate environment 
mortgage loan origination fees increased from  in to million during to million for fees associated with deposit accounts increased primarily as a result of the increased volume of deposit accounts 
in fact  total service charges and fees as a percent of the deposit base dropped from 
in to 
in however  the addition of a new overdraft checking privilege program called bounce free checking  which the company added during the second quarter of  substantially increased fee income from the previous year 
service charges and fees  which include the bounce free checking program  have increased from  in to million in to million in in addition  the company realized gains of  on the sale of investment securities during versus a realized gain of  in there were no securities gains or losses taken in non interest expense 
non interest expense represents the overhead expenses of the company 
management regularly monitors all categories of non interest expense in an attempt to improve productivity and operating performance 
non interest expense increased to million in from million in the expense recorded during was higher than the million amount recorded in the increase in reflects the additional operating costs associated with growth as the bank added more staff to handle increases in volume of business as a result of internal growth and the acquisition of two other financial institutions during the year 
at december  there were branches and full time equivalent employees 
during  the bank added branches through acquisition and accompanying support personnel  expanded both the commercial lending area and the mortgage origination group  and had an overall increase in the volume of transactions processed and the number of customers 
at december  there were branches and full time equivalent employees 
specific categories of expenses and related causes for increases are as follows salary and benefit expense for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
increases each year were the result of additional personnel hired as new branches and departments were added or obtained through acquisition each year as discussed above 
occupancy expense increased from  in to million in and to million in the increases were primarily a result of lease expenses associated with new locations and additional space needed for expansion of existing departments 
furniture and equipment expense increased from  in to  in and to million in due to the increase in these assets needed for the new locations and general expansion 
the increases in other operating expenses from to included a increase in telephone expenses from  to  a increase in postage from  to  and a increase in public relations and advertising costs from  to  in addition  courier costs  or those costs associated with getting customer transactions to the bank s outside processing center  increased due to the additional branches being serviced by such couriers 
all such increases were a direct result of the new branches or expansion of existing departments and were within management s expected ranges 
provision for income taxes 
current federal and state income tax expenses resulting from operations during were offset by the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for that same amount during those same periods 
accordingly  total income tax benefits recorded on the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december  reflects only the actual amounts received back from the federal and state taxing authorities for refunds of prior year over payments 
during  the company reversed all of the remaining valuation allowances and the reserved deferred tax assets were recorded on the consolidated financial statements of the company  resulting in a one time net tax benefit of  that benefit was offset by additional tax expenses during to leave a net tax expense during that year of  throughout  the company was fully taxable and recorded a tax expense of million 
financial condition

total assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in total assets of million in  or  reflects the two acquisitions the company completed in as well as the strong internal growth trend of the bank since its incorporation in the largest component of asset growth was the increase in loans 
total liabilities increased from million in to million in the primary cause for the increase between the periods is an increase in deposits as a result of the two acquisitions  internal growth and an increase in borrowings

stockholders equity increased from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to the two acquisitions the company completed in as the bank issued million in stock in connection with the acquisitions 
in addition  retained earnings increased as a result of the current period net income of million offset in part by dividends paid to shareholders and a reduction of equity as a result of a stock buyback program whereby the company acquired million worth of its outstanding stock

these unrealized gains are included net of taxes in stockholders equity 
assets cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents  including non interest bearing and interest bearing cash and federal funds sold  increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily the result of funds received from the increases in deposits associated with the two acquisitions not yet being invested in loans or in the investment portfolio

management charged off loans totaling million   and  net of recoveries  as uncollectible during  and  respectively 
the large increase in the amount was the result of four large commercial loan relationships that totaled million  or of the total amount charged off  as well as continued softening in the economy and isolated instances of specific business problems

the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historic dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the rate of inflation has been relatively moderate over the past few years  however  the effect of inflation on interest rates can materially impact bank operations  which rely on the spread between the yield on earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowings as the major source of earnings 
operating costs  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment costs  can also be negatively impacted by inflation 
risk factors you should consider the following material risk factors carefully before deciding to invest in the company s securities 
if any of the events described below occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock may decline  in which case the value of your investment may decline as well 
our results are impacted by the economic conditions of our principal operating regions our operations are concentrated throughout several regions in north carolina including the central and western parts of the state 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results may correlate to the economic conditions in these areas 
a deterioration in economic conditions in any of these market areas  particularly in the industries on which these geographic areas depend  may adversely affect the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services  and accordingly  our results of operations 
we are exposed to risks in connection with the loans we make a significant source of risk for us arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
we have underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses  that we believe are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our loan portfolio 
such policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we compete with larger companies for some of the same business the banking and financial services business in our market areas continues to be a competitive field and is becoming more competitive as a result of 
changes in regulations  
changes in technology and product delivery systems  and 
the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets  and our results of operations could be adversely affected by the nature or pace of change in competition 
we compete for loans  deposits and customers with various bank and non bank financial services providers  many of which are larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services 
our trading volume has been low compared with larger banks the trading volume in our common stock on the nasdaq national market has been comparable to other similarly sized banks 
nevertheless  this trading is relatively low when compared with more seasoned companies listed on the nasdaq national market or other consolidated reporting systems or stock exchanges 
thus  the market in our common stock may be limited in scope relative to other companies 
we depend heavily on our key management personnel james a 
beck currently serves as our president and chief executive officer 
we depend heavily on the services of mr 
beck  and a number of other key personnel 
even though we carry a million key man life insurance policy on mr 
beck  the loss of his services or of other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our success depends in part on our ability to retain key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel who have experience both in sophisticated banking matters and in operating a small to mid size bank 
competition for such personnel is strong in the banking industry and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require 
we expect to effectively compete in this area by offering financial packages that include incentive based compensation and the opportunity to join in the rewarding work of building a new bank 
technological advances impact our business the banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving customer services  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to our customers
