these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related income statement  asset and or liability amounts 
investments the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other than temporary and require the recognition of an impairment loss in earnings 
management uses criteria such as the period of time that securities have been in an unrealized loss position  types of securities and their related industries  as well as published investment rating and analyst reports to evaluate their portfolio 
management considers the unrealized losses at december  to be temporary in nature 
impairment of goodwill indefinite lived intangibles the company evaluates the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually to determine if they may be impaired 
if the carrying amounts of the assets are not recoverable based upon discounted cash flow analysis  they are reduced by the estimated shortfall of fair value compared to the recorded value 
the company completed the annually required valuation process and no impairment losses were recognized in however  should actual results or changes in future expectations differ from those projected by management  goodwill impairment may be required and may be material 
warranty reserves the company offers to its customers a variety of warranties on its products ranging from to years in length and up to ten years on certain structural components 
estimated costs related to product warranty are accrued at the time of sale and included in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based upon past warranty claims and sales history and adjusted as required to reflect actual costs incurred  as information becomes available 
warranty expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
accrued liabilities for warranty expense at december  and were million and million  respectively 
litigation and product liability reserves at december  the company had reserves for numerous other loss exposures  such as product liability million and litigation million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes in assumptions could materially affect the company s recorded liabilities for loss

forward looking statements this annual report contains certain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events 
forward looking statements are necessarily subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are outside the control of the company that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 
these uncertainties and other factors include  but are not limited to  the potential fluctuations in the company s operating results  the condition of the telecommunications industry which purchases modular structures  the availability and price of gasoline  which can impact the sale of recreational vehicles  availability of chassis  which are used in the production of many of the company s recreational vehicle products  interest rates  which affect the affordability of the company s products  changing government regulations  such as those covering accounting standards  environmental matters or product warranties and recalls  which may affect costs of operations  revenues  product acceptance and profitability  legislation governing the relationships of the company with its recreational vehicle dealers  which may affect the company s options and liabilities in the event of a general economic downturn  the impact of economic uncertainty on high cost discretionary product purchases  which can hinder the sales of recreational vehicles  the demand for commercial structures in the various industries that the modular housing and building segment serves  the ability of the housing and building segment to perform in new market segments where it has limited experience  and also on the state of the recreational vehicle and modular housing and building industries in the united states 
other factors affecting forward looking statements include the cyclical and seasonal nature of the company s businesses  adverse weather  changes in property taxes and energy costs  changes in federal income tax laws and federal mortgage financing programs  changes in public policy  competition in these industries  the company s ability to maintain or increase gross margins which are critical to profitability whether there are or are not increased sales  the outbreak of war and other significant national and international events  and other risks and uncertainties 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive  and the company disclaims any obligation to subsequently revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
at times  the company s actual performance differs materially from its projections and estimates regarding the economy  the recreational vehicle and modular housing and building industries and other key performance indicators 
readers of this report are cautioned that reliance on any forward looking statements involves risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that the assumptions on which the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate given the inherent uncertainties as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events 
there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements contained in this report will prove to be accurate 
the inclusion of a forward looking statement herein should not be regarded as a representation by the company that the company s objectives will be achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing and investing yields 
the company did not utilize its credit facility in in  the company utilized its credit facility in connection with the acquisition of kan build and such borrowings were repaid within six months 
short term borrowings were utilized in in connection with the miller building acquisition and were repaid within sixty days 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would primarily impact the company s long term debt 
at december   the company had million of long term debt  including current maturities 
long term debt consists mainly of industrial development revenue bonds that have variable or floating rates 
at december   the company had million invested in short term and million in long term marketable securities 
the company s marketable securities consist of public utility preferred stocks which typically pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
these financial instruments are subject to market risk in that available energy supplies and changes in available interest rates would impact the market value of the preferred stocks 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company utilizes us treasury bond future options as a protection against the impact of increases in interest rates on the fair value of the company s investments in these fixed rate preferred stocks 
outstanding options are marked to market with market value changes recognized in current earnings 
the us treasury bond futures options generally have terms ranging from to days 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   including variable or floating rate debt and derivatives used to hedge the fair value of fixed rate preferred stocks  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
