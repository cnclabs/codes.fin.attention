item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business of the company the company has two reportable segments cooper tire and cooper standard automotive 
the company s reportable segments are each managed separately because they offer different products requiring different marketing and distribution strategies 

table of contents cooper tire produces light vehicle  truck and motorcycle tires  and inner tubes  which are sold nationally and internationally in the replacement tire market to independent dealers  wholesale distributors  regional and national retail tire chains  and large retail chains that sell other products in addition to tires  and supplies equipment and materials to the truck tire retread industry 
cooper standard automotive produces body sealing systems  active and passive vibration control systems  and fluid handling systems  primarily for the global automotive original equipment manufacturing and replacement markets 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presents information related to the consolidated results of operations of the company  including the impact of restructuring costs on the company s results  a discussion of the past results and future outlook of each of the company s segments  and information concerning both the liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies of the company 
an important qualification regarding the forward looking statements made in this discussion is then presented 
consolidated results of operations consolidated net sales in were billion  an increase of million  or percent  from billion in of this increase  million was the result of favorable foreign currency translation 
net sales in were nine percent lower than the record sales level of billion recorded in  due to a significant reduction in light vehicle production in  lower tire sales  due primarily to the fact that sales in benefited from the impact of the firestone recall which took place that year  and the absence in of sales of two plastics businesses that were divested in the second quarter of operating profit  net income and earnings per share were million  million  and on a diluted basis in  million  million and cents in  and million  million and in operating profit in benefited from the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the accounting pronouncement which requires that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested annually for impairment 
in response to this accounting pronouncement  the company tested for goodwill impairment  and determined that the valuation of its reporting units  based on discounted future cashflows  exceeded the values recorded on the balance sheets of the reporting units 
goodwill is tested for impairment more frequently if there is reason to believe a significant negative change in estimated future cashflows has occurred due to a specific event or set of events 
the amortization of goodwill in was million 
results in also improved due to higher sales in both the tire and automotive segments and the benefits of the restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives in the automotive segment 
reductions from of million in interest expense and million in products liability costs also benefited operating profit in operating profit in was adversely affected by a charge for a class action settlement and related defense costs of million million after income taxes  cents per share  and in by a charge for restructuring of million million after income taxes  cents per share and losses at facilities that were closed or sold of million million after tax  cents per share 
in addition  operating profit in was adversely affected by a million increase in product liability costs cents per share over results in were also adversely impacted by lower sales in both the tire and automotive segments than in  resulting from a weakened economy 
a reduction in year over year interest expense in of million  resulting from the repayment of debt and lower interest rates  mitigated the decline in net income 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales in  million percent of net sales in  and million percent of net sales in the increase in is largely attributable to the cost of employee incentive programs which provide for compensation based on profitability 
spending levels in and were unchanged  with the percentage increase in due almost entirely to the lower sales level 
interest expense was million in  a decrease of million from million in this decrease reflects the impact of the repayment of debt of approximately million and the impact of interest rate swaps of approximately million 
interest expense decreased million in from million in  reflecting a reduction in debt levels and lower interest rates 
other income decreased to million in from million in in  other income was million 
gains resulting from the sale of two tire warehouses and an aircraft in were responsible for million of income  while in the sale of an aircraft contributed million of income 
the decrease in is also partially attributable to premium costs of million incurred in connection with the repurchase of portions of the company s public notes during the company s effective income tax rate was percent in  which was lower than the percent rate in this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of the amortization of non deductible goodwill in accordance with sfas no  which became effective january   and global tax planning  which was offset by increases in valuation reserves 
the effective tax rate decreased in from percent in  due largely to the impact of global tax planning and the mix of earnings by entity across state and local jurisdictions 

table of contents at december   the company has future tax benefits of million related to various foreign and state net operating losses and other tax credit carryforwards for which valuation reserves of million have been recorded 
the company recorded valuation allowances for certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards because it believes it is more likely than not that such carryforwards cannot be utilized 
the remaining million of future tax benefits primarily result from net operating loss carryforwards incurred by the company s subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france and a united states foreign tax credit carryforward 
some of these can be utilized indefinitely while others expire from through the amounts expiring in the next five years  for which no valuation allowance has been recorded  approximate million 
it is more likely than not the carryforwards for which no valuation allowance has been established will be realized based upon forecasted future earnings  which are anticipated to result in future taxable income  and the implementation of certain tax strategies 
the company maintains defined benefit pension plans for most of its employees in the united states and certain of its foreign employees 
the methodology used to determine the expense and the funding requirements of those plans is described in the section of this management s discussion and analysis entitled critical accounting policies pension and postretirement benefits 
most of the assets of the pension plans are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income investments 
because of the declines in the financial markets over the past three years  the plans have incurred investment losses over that period 
as a result  pension expense has increased from million in to million in and million in the increase in was million lower than it would have otherwise been  because of the introduction of a lower cost cash balance pension plan in for new salaried and non bargained hourly employees and certain other salaried and non bargained hourly employees who did not meet specified age and service criteria 
pension expense is expected to increase to approximately million in  due to the investment losses incurred in  a lowering of the expected long term investment return on domestic plan assets from percent to percent  and a lowering of the discount rate used to measure domestic pension liabilities from percent at december  to percent at december  over one half of the expected increase in is attributable to the amortization of the actuarial losses incurred by the plans in  resulting primarily from the investment losses incurred in growth in the plans assets sufficient to meet the company s long term pension obligations is provided by both the investment returns on assets of the plans and additional funds added to the plans by the company 
pension funding increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in was the result of the company s decisions to accelerate the timing of a funding commitment that would otherwise have been due in and to fund certain plans at the maximum amount deductible for united states income tax purposes 
the increase in from reflected the company s inability to fund certain of its pension plans in due to the limits established for their deductibility under united states income tax regulations 
the funding level of the company s pension plans during is anticipated to approximate million 
the company currently provides retiree medical and life insurance benefits to a significant percentage of its domestic salaried and hourly employees 
expense recorded for this item was million in  million in  and million in because of this rate of increase  the company has determined that it is necessary to take steps to mitigate the impact of medical cost inflation 
as a result  domestic salaried and non bargained hourly employees hired on or after january  will not be eligible for retiree medical or life insurance coverage 
in addition  the company intends to implement increased cost sharing in in the medical coverage provided to current retirees 
these changes will apply as well to current employees as they retire 
as a result of these measures  expense for these benefits in is expected to remain at approximately million 
the effects of inflation did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the company in   and restructuring year in  the company recognized a restructuring charge of million related to decisions to close or consolidate manufacturing plants and administrative facilities  downsize the workforce at those and other locations  and relocate assets and ongoing business from locations for which closure decisions had been made prior to of this charge  almost million consisted of employee separation costs  million consisted of related exit costs  and an asset impairment charge of million was taken  relating to long lived assets at the locations affected by the downsizing decisions 
the charge was taken in part to take advantage of the synergies available following completion of the standard products and siebe acquisitions in and  respectively  and  in part to a more generalized need to enhance future profitability through better utilization of existing capacity and the creation of greater operational efficiencies 
during  facilities were closed or downsized and employment reductions were made 
an additional employees were terminated and two more facilities were downsized in the company also incurred additional restructuring expense of million in  consisting of employee separation costs at a tire production facility in the united kingdom and the costs of relocating employees  physical assets and ongoing business from closed manufacturing facilities in europe and the united states 
in and  reversals of the charge for these initiatives of million and million  respectively  were recorded  due primarily to lower than anticipated headcount reductions in the european facilities affected by consolidation  and by severance costs that were lower than anticipated for those employees who were terminated 
the restructuring initiatives associated with this charge were completed in 
table of contents the restructuring initiative positively impacted the company s operating profit by million in approximately percent of the impact in benefited the automotive segment 
the positive impact of this restructuring on operating profit in is expected to be million 
year in  the company recognized restructuring charges of million  of which million related to headcount reductions at four manufacturing and administrative facilities in the automotive segment  and million was attributable to asset impairment charges related to long lived assets in the automotive segment 
these charges were taken as part of the automotive segment s decision to reorganize and rationalize certain of its non manufacturing operations to reduce overall overhead costs 
a total of employees were terminated as a result of these restructuring efforts 
the company completed these reductions during additional restructuring expenses of million were recorded in  of which million was associated with the relocation of assets from closed manufacturing facilities in the automotive segment  and million was attributable to additional employee separation costs 
these amounts were offset by the reversal of million of the charge taken in the restructuring costs incurred in positively impacted the operating profit of the automotive segment by million in  and is expected to have a favorable impact of million in year in  the company recorded additional restructuring expenses of million 
of this amount  million related to the consolidation of the company s fluid systems manufacturing operations in sao paulo  brazil to the company s manufacturing plant in varginha  brazil  the consolidation of the company s rubber mixing operations in europe to its mixing facility in france  and a small consolidation of facilities in the united kingdom 
this entire amount related to headcount reductions of approximately employees associated with these consolidations  and was taken because of the need to reduce ongoing costs in the company s international operations  where profitability has lagged due in part to overhead costs resulting from excess production capacity 
the company expects to complete these initiatives in additional restructuring expenses of million were recorded in  related to asset write downs at north american facilities in excess of the amounts established in the restructuring reserves almost million  additional severance costs almost million  and costs of transferring assets and ongoing production from closed facilities in europe and north america almost million 
these restructuring amounts were offset by the reversal of million of the charge taken in  and 
million of the charge taken in the reversal of a portion of the charge was due to the fact that fewer employees were terminated than had originally been anticipated 
a part of the benefit of these initiatives will occur in  but the full impact  approximately million  will occur in all of the savings will benefit the automotive segment 
additional information related to these restructuring initiatives appears in the restructuring note to the financial statements 
tire segment overview sales of passenger car and light truck tire replacement units in the united states market by members of the rubber manufacturers association rma  which comprises virtually all of the largest tire companies in the world and includes the segment  and which accounted for over percent of the total united states tire market in both and  decreased by approximately three percent in from levels in in  rma member replacement unit sales decreased by approximately percent from sales levels 
sales of replacement tire units in the united states by non rma members  which consist primarily of smaller manufacturers located outside the united states  increased by approximately percent during the year was a record high sales year  due largely to the well publicized recall of certain firestone tires 
consumer demand softened in early due primarily to a weakened united states economy and the end of the firestone recall 
this softening continued generally throughout the year  although a second recall by ford motor company of certain firestone tires in mid provided a boost to the market during that period 
the company believes that the terrorist incidents of september  contributed to a significant weakening of the economy during the latter part of with the exception of a rebound in the first quarter of  the market remained weak during sales sales of the tire segment were billion in  an increase of million  or four percent  from billion in tire unit sales for were up nearly five percent from the segment significantly increased its sales volumes to the growing regional tire retail business and also reported higher sales of its proprietary  brand name tires 
despite product pricing that was higher in than in  the segment s overall dollar sales increase was slightly lower than its unit sales improvement  due principally to the sale of a large number of opening price point tires to a large retail customer 
sales for were five percent  or million  lower than the billion recorded in tire unit sales were down eight percent from the segment s sales decrease resulted primarily from a significant softening in consumer demand in due to generally weak economic conditions  the abnormally high demand for certain tires generated by the firestone recall announced in  and 
table of contents increased purchases in the fourth quarter of ahead of a january  price increase 
improvements in pricing and product mix partially offset these factors 
sales of the segment s operations in north america increased by more than four percent in most of the increase occurred during the first quarter when industry sales were strong 
sales over the last nine months of the year were essentially flat as general industry demand softened 
sales increased somewhat late in the fourth quarter following the announcement of a price increase effective january  the segment s unit sales of passenger tires increased by nearly four percent in  versus a very slight industrywide sales decrease 
passenger tires account for over percent of the combined passenger and light and medium truck replacement tire market 
the segment was able to increase market penetration in this area in spite of a continued increase in imported  low priced passenger tires 
the segment s unit sales of light truck replacement tires increased by more than six percent in  just slightly less than the industrywide sales improvement 
significant increases in imports of light truck tires in were a major factor in preventing the segment from increasing its share of the market for those tires 
the segment s unit sales of passenger tires declined by percent in versus an industrywide sales decrease of four percent 
this was partly due to the fact that the company did not participate in the ford recall of firestone tire recall to the same extent as certain other manufacturers who reached agreements with ford motor company regarding replacement of firestone tires 
continued imports of low priced passenger tires were also a factor in the decline relative to the industry 
in the light truck tire portion of the market  industrywide sales declined eight percent in from while the segment s sales of light truck tires decreased by approximately four percent 
sales of the segment s international operations increased by nearly million  or seven percent  in from  following an increase of three percent in from almost one half of the increase in was attributable to the foreign exchange impact of a weakened united states dollar in relation to the british pound 
the remaining sales growth resulted primarily from strong winter tire sales in europe and increased penetration of two major retail chains in europe 
sales of the segment s commercial products operations decreased two percent in compared to sales of radial medium truck tires increased by percent in  as the segment continued to successfully focus on increasing its penetration of that market 
this increase was more than offset by declines in custom rubber mixing and inner tube sales 
sales of the commercial products operations declined in from due to the loss of a large retread products customer and extreme weakness in the commercial trucking industry 
operating profit operating profit in was million  an improvement from the million reported in operating margins in were percent compared to percent in the segment s performance in reflects the adverse impact of the class action settlement and related defense costs of million  or percent in operating margin 
operating profit in was million with an operating margin of percent 
operating performance in north america in was adversely impacted by several factors a less favorable product and customer mix  which impacted operating profit by million  inefficiencies resulting from operating the segment s manufacturing facilities at less than full capacity as it implemented inventory reductions  which negatively affected operating profit by about million  and higher employee incentive based compensation and benefit costs of approximately million 
the less favorable product and customer mix occurred because a greater percentage of the segment s sales resulted from shipments of opening price point tires to lower margin customers 
offsetting these negative factors were an increase in sales  which favorably impacted operating profit by almost million  and lower raw material costs of million 
operating profit during was helped by a more favorable product mix  price increases implemented in north america during the first and third quarters  and moderation during the year in the cost of energy and certain raw materials derived from petroleum 
by the end of the year  many raw materials used by the segment were priced lower than in recent years 
these improvements were not sufficient to offset the impacts of lower sales  product liability provisions which impacted the segment by million in  an increase of million from  and production curtailments which took place in response to the weak market conditions experienced during the year 
the cost of these production curtailments totaled million in outlook the outlook for the tire segment for is dependent on many factors  including total vehicle miles driven  which in turn is affected by factors such as general economic conditions and fuel prices 
if the economy continues the gradual recovery which has occurred generally through  the segment anticipates that the replacement tire market in the united states will grow in however  industry volume for the first two months of has declined significantly  which the segment believes is largely due to the negative impact of worldwide political and economic uncertainty on consumer demand 
the segment cannot predict how long this weakness will continue  but is reviewing the performance of the segment over the short term and the possible impact of the weakness on the 
table of contents segment performance for the balance of the year 
the segment anticipates demand will rebound once current global tensions abate as it believes pent up demand for replacement tires is beginning to build 
any growth in the market in will reverse industrywide sales declines that occurred in both and the segment believes these declines have resulted from a combination of weak economic conditions and the impacts of the firestone recall in and the ford recall of firestone tires in  which caused the replacement in those years of a large number of tires that would otherwise not have been replaced until later years 
as time goes by  the disruptive impact of those recalls on the market will begin to dissipate and will result in a return to a more typical replacement market 
the tire industry s leading trade association anticipates that the return to normalcy will begin to manifest itself in  and the segment s outlook for the year similarly anticipates such an occurrence 
regardless of the extent of any growth in the replacement tire industry  the segment expects  although it cannot assure  its sales performance will outpace that of the industry as a whole  due largely to the expectation that it will continue to increase its market share with retail customers as well as increase its presence in the high performance sector of the market  which it has targeted for future growth 
improvements in the segment s profitability are dependent not only on higher sales levels  which will increase capacity utilization at its facilities  but also on its ability to realize price increases 
the segment announced price increases on most of its product lines  effective january  the combination of higher sales and higher prices are important to the segment s profitability because of raw material costs that are expected to be higher than in  increased pension and medical costs  and greater product liability insurance costs 
lower than expected sales would increase pressure on the segment s continuing effort to reduce inventories  and could require the segment to consider temporary production curtailments which would likely have an adverse impact on profitability 
the segment s profitability improvement in is also dependent on continuing success in its efforts to implement its ongoing supply chain management initiative and its ability to integrate lean manufacturing concepts and other cost saving efforts into all of its processes 
this is important because of the continued pressure on the industry caused by the importation of competing products from china and other countries where the cost of tire production is substantially lower than in the united states 
unlike certain of its competitors  the segment does not presently maintain production facilities in such countries 
the segment has an agreement under which its subsidiary in the united kingdom purchases chinese produced tires  and it is considering opportunities to expand that relationship 
the segment anticipates that the relative weakness of the british pound versus the euro will allow its subsidiary in the united kingdom to increase its sales and profitability levels over the improved levels shown in a shift to higher margin products over the past two years paid off in improved performance in and the segment anticipates that those improvements will continue in in the wake of the firestone recall announced in  the tire industry and the company have experienced a significantly higher level of product liability litigation 
it is likely that the cost of this litigation and the number of lawsuits brought against the company will remain at the current high levels during in addition  while the products liability insurance program which will take effect beginning on april  is not yet in place  it is likely the self insured retention contained in any replacement program will be higher  it is possible the aggregate retention limit will be eliminated  and insurance premium costs will increase 
this change in insurance coverage is expected to result in significant increases in product liability costs over levels  which are likely to impact the profits of the tire segment 
the company is exploring options  including but not limited to the formation of a captive insurance company  to mitigate the impact of these changes 
the segment will begin to be impacted in by the transportation recall enhancement accountability and documentation act tread act which became law on november   and which will directly impact the tire industry 
the tread act and any rules promulgated under the act are applicable to all tire manufacturers and importers of tires who sell tires in the united states  regardless of where such tires are manufactured 
pursuant to the statute  the national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa  the federal agency which oversees certain aspects of the tire industry  has proposed rules relating to test standards  tire labeling  tire pressure monitoring  early warning reporting  tire recalls and record retention 
rules for certain of these issues have been finalized and others are expected to be finalized in however  petitions for reconsideration of certain of the finalized rules have been filed with nhtsa and the outcome of those petitions cannot be predicted with any certainty 
the segment does not presently expect that any additional costs associated with implementing these rules will be material in automotive segment overview the company s automotive segment provides parts to automotive oems throughout the world 
light vehicle production in north america increased in to million vehicles from million vehicles in production in was million vehicles  the highest level ever recorded 
production in europe was down approximately two percent in at million vehicles from million vehicles in production in was unchanged from levels 
in brazil  the vehicle build in was million vehicles  down more than nine percent from the million vehicle level in as in europe  the vehicle level was unchanged from the level 

table of contents the business environment for the automotive industry is extremely challenging at the present time 
pricing pressure on the oems  as evidenced by the zero percent financing and record high rebates offered throughout  increased pension and other retirement related costs  and the impact of continued global overcapacity  have reduced the overall profitability of the industry  and have caused the oems to continue to pursue price concessions from their suppliers 
notwithstanding the difficulties faced by the industry  and especially by suppliers  the segment s emphasis on continuous improvement  lean manufacturing and other cost reduction initiatives  and the completion of earlier restructuring plans allowed the segment to substantially improve its profitability in the segment will continue its sharp focus on cost containment and similar measures to assure its continued competitiveness in the automotive supply environment 
sales sales for the automotive segment were billion in  an increase of more than seven percent from billion in sales increases in north america of million were the result of the increases in light vehicle production and the impact of net new business that has launched during the past year 
these increases were partially offset by price concessions 
sales in north america were adversely impacted by approximately million due to foreign currency fluctuations 
in the segment s international operations  a sales increase of million was equally attributable to the impact of new business and the favorable impact of foreign currency adjustments 
sales for the automotive segment in were billion  a decrease of percent from billion in approximately percent  or million  of the decline is attributable to the absence of the sales of two plastics businesses that were sold during the second quarter of the remainder of the sales decrease was primarily the result of the decrease in light vehicle production in north america from the levels of  and to a lesser extent  the impact of lower prices for many of the segment s products and the discontinuance of certain programs for which the segment provided products 
new business commencing in was not sufficient to offset this volume decline 
approximately percent of the segment s sales in were in north america  percent in europe  and two percent in brazil  australia and india 
comparable percentages in and were approximately percent in north america  percent in europe and four percent in brazil  australia and india 
although the segment does business with all of the world s major automakers  approximately percent of its global sales in were to ford  daimlerchrysler  and general motors 
in and  approximately percent of the segment s sales were to these three oems 
nearly all of the segment s foreign sales were of body sealing components and fluid handling systems 
approximately percent of the total sales of each of these product lines were derived from foreign operations in  and operating profit operating profit in was million  an improvement from the million reported in operating margins in were per cent compared to per cent in the segment s operating profit in was favorably impacted by the absence of amortization of goodwill  which amounted to million in  the increase in light vehicle production from  which was responsible for approximately million of the improvement  the impact of the restructuring initiatives undertaken in and and  to a lesser extent  increased volume resulting from new business 
in addition  the segment was able to operate its facilities more efficiently in as a result of more stable oem production levels than was the case in the segment s results reflect its successful efforts to overcome the adverse impacts of price concessions granted to the segment s customers and increases in pension and medical costs 
the segment s operating profit in declined from million in to million 
the reduction in north american light vehicle production levels in and disruption due to restructuring activities in the segment s manufacturing facilities  including inefficiencies resulting from the redeployment of the business of the closed rocky mount  north carolina sealing production plant to two other facilities  were primarily responsible for the lower operating profits reported by the segment 
other factors were the inefficiencies created by erratic scheduling resulting from the short lead times given by the oems in advance of the frequent production curtailments that occurred during the year and price concessions granted in the segment reported operating profit of million in  an operating margin of percent 
operating profits and margins were adversely impacted in by restructuring costs of million related to achieving synergies available following the acquisitions of standard products and siebe  million in operating losses at facilities that were closed or sold following the standard products acquisition and million of goodwill amortization 
the segment s business outside of north america was profitable in  whereas losses were recorded in the improvement was due to more efficient operations in both the sealing and fluid systems units in europe  as efforts to reduce the cost structure of the segment s european operations through the restructuring initiatives implemented over the past two years favorably impacted results 

table of contents these improvements more than offset the continued effects of weak economic conditions affecting the segment s brazilian operations 
the segment s business outside of north america was not profitable in  due to costs associated with significant product launches in both the sealing and fluid systems units in the united kingdom  the inefficiencies associated with the substantial restructuring that the segment has undertaken in europe  and the effects of a weakened economy in brazil  due largely to an energy crisis 
outlook sales for the automotive segment are expected to be approximately the same in as in an increase in volume from new business that will be launched during the year is expected to be offset by price concessions and slightly lower light vehicle production in the performance of the segment in may also differ substantially from the segment s present expectations if light vehicle production is significantly higher or lower than is presently forecasted 
the segment projected at the beginning of the year that light vehicle production in in north america  where nearly percent of the segment s sales are made  will be million vehicles  down from million in european and south american production levels are expected to be approximately the same in as in given uncertainty over the prognosis for the united states and global economies in  the segment is prepared to make rapid adjustments in its plans for the year if it becomes apparent that production levels will vary significantly from current predicted levels 
several factors are expected to impact the segment in first  the segment is involved in numerous significant product launches in  especially in its sealing systems operations in north america  where launches can be complex and costly 
the segment s ability to meet its profit forecasts for is dependent upon its ability to successfully implement its planned product launches 
the largest of these launches is the body sealing package for the new ford f series truck 
the launch of this vehicle  in which all of the north american divisions of the automotive segment will participate  is expected to result in total sales on this platform of approximately million by  when the new truck is at full production 
second  while not expected to be material in  certain divisions of the segment are being affected by competition from imports from lower cost production facilities  principally in korea and china 
the segment plans to meet this challenge by a combination of north american cost reductions and its own asian sourcing 
third  the competitive conditions in the global automotive industry continue to result in significant pressure on the segment to reduce the pricing for its products 
the continued ability of the segment to maintain or improve its financial returns is dependent upon increasing its sales and reducing its costs to a level sufficient to offset the impact of price concessions 
in europe  the segment continues to place additional business at its lower cost facilities in poland and the czech republic 
doing so is part of the segment s plan to continue the profitability improvements manifested by the segment s european operations in the limited number of new product launches in europe in will allow the segment to concentrate on further restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives during the year 
in brazil  the segment has been adversely affected by very poor economic conditions  unfavorable pricing for its products and the impact of a weak brazilian currency 
the impact of these factors has been softened by the cost savings associated with combining the segment s sealing and fluid systems business into the segment s plant in varginha  brazil  but additional business and better pricing will be required for the segment to earn an adequate return on its investment there in and beyond 
the segment has a per cent equity position in jin young standard  inc in korea and is working closely with its korean partner to expand jin young s business with the korean oems  who have increased their share of the global automobile market in recent years 
the segment has been successful in significantly improving its financial performance through increased market share and aggressive cost reduction measures 
the segment expects that it will again be able to achieve significant efficiencies in the launch of significant new business beginning later in is expected to result in increased sales and operating profit in even if industry production levels remain unchanged 
liquidity and capital resources generation and uses of cash net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million higher than the million generated in  due primarily to a million increase in net income from net cash provided by operating activities of million in was million higher than the million generated in this improvement was due in part to a change in the payment pattern of a significant tire customer  offset by a reduction in net income  adjusted for noncash charges  of million

offsetting this reduction in was the placement of million of debt in canada under a five year note 
in  the company s total debt increased by million  due substantially to the issuance of commercial paper to fund the siebe acquisition 
this increase in debt was largely offset by proceeds received from the sale of two plastics businesses for cash of million and by a purchase price adjustment related to the siebe acquisition 
the company also used million to repurchase  shares of its common shares in dividends paid on the company s common shares were million  million and million in  and  respectively  as the company maintained a quarterly dividend of cents per share through the entire period

the amendment provided for the exclusion of certain charges in calculating the ratio 
the amendment also allowed the company to maintain a total debt to total capitalization ratio of percent through december  and percent thereafter  and permitted the exclusion of the impact of the cumulative currency translation adjustment recorded in equity from the total debt to total capitalization measurement 
further  the amendment provided that any adverse impact from any potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles upon adoption in of sfas no

new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company  see the significant accounting policies accounting pronouncements note to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in its specific circumstances 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the significant accounting policies note to the financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies 
products liability the company is subject from time to time to products liability claims and lawsuits with respect to its tire products 
the company s current policy is to conduct a quarterly evaluation of each individual products liability claim or lawsuit based on the specific facts and circumstances of each claim or lawsuit  historical trends and an assessment of the litigation environment 
a 
table of contents judgment is then made  taking into account the views of counsel  past experience and other relevant factors  to determine the company s requirement to establish or revise an accrual for the aggregate liability 
the company s exposure for each claim or lawsuit is limited by the coverage provided by its current products liability insurance program which will remain in effect through march  that program includes a relatively low per claim deductible and a cap on the total deductible on claims arising from occurrences which took place during a particular year 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 
the disclosure of products liability costs in the company s financial statements includes the legal costs incurred in defending cases brought against the company and accruals recorded pursuant to the forgoing policy 
products liability insurance premiums are not included as part of products liability costs  but are recorded as an insurance expense 
while the products liability insurance program which will take effect beginning on april  is not yet in place  it is likely the self insured retention contained in any replacement program will be higher  it is possible the aggregate retention limit will be eliminated  and insurance premium costs will increase 
this change in insurance coverage is expected to result in significant increases in product liability costs over levels  which are likely to impact the profits of the tire segment 
the company is exploring options  including but not limited to the formation of a captive insurance company  to mitigate the impact of these changes 
such changes may also require the formulation of a different policy to account for products liability exposures 
whether a change is made  and if made  the nature of the change  cannot be determined until the new insurance program is in place 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company establishes a valuation allowance to record its deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while future projections for taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at december   a valuation allowance of million was recorded on purchased net operating loss carryforwards of million and  to the extent such benefits are realized  the benefits will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
at december   the company has future tax benefits of million related to various foreign and state net operating losses and other tax credit carryforwards for which valuation reserves of million have been recorded 
the company recorded valuation allowances for certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards because it believes it is more likely than not that such carryforwards cannot be utilized 
the remaining million of future tax benefits primarily result from net operating loss carryforwards incurred by the company s subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france and a united states foreign tax credit carryforward 
some of these can be utilized indefinitely while others expire from through the amounts expiring in the next five years  for which no valuation allowance has been recorded  approximate million 
it is more likely than not the carryforwards for which no valuation allowance has been established will be realized based upon forecasted future earnings  which are anticipated to result in future taxable income  and the implementation of certain tax strategies 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company will compare the undiscounted cash flows generated by the business units to the carrying value of the long lived assets 
based on current facts  the company believes there is no impairment 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s businesses 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  the company assessed the impact of sfas no 
at january  and again at december  and no impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was indicated 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has recorded significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities which are developed from actuarial valuations  primarily for plans in the united states 
inherent in the determination of the company s pension liabilities are key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits payments  expected returns on plan assets  and the rates of future compensation increases 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other postretirement benefit liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  its actuaries 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments and reflects the current rate at which the pension and other postretirement liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
the company considers the prevailing interest rates on ten year moody s aa corporate bonds when determining the discount rate 
based upon this analysis  the company reduced the discount rate used to measure its united states pension and postretirement benefit liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december  the effect of this one half percent reduction in the discount rate assumption will be increases of approximately million in pension expense and approximately million in other postretirement benefits expense 

table of contents the rate of future compensation increases is used to determine the future benefits to be paid for salaried and non bargained employees  because the amount of a participant s pension is partially attributable to the compensation earned during his or her career 
the rate reflects the company s expectations over time for salary and wage inflation and the impacts of promotions and incentive compensation  which is based on profitability 
the company reduced the rate of future compensation increases used to measure its united states pension liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december   primarily due to its outlook for the economy and the industries in which it competes 
the effect of this one percent decrease in the assumption for compensation increases in will be a decrease of approximately million in pension expense 
the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense which approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
during  the value of the company s plan assets declined due to the general market conditions 
based on recent and projected market and economic conditions  the company decreased the expected long term return on its united states plan assets to percent from the percent assumed in this assumption change will result in an increase in pension expense for of approximately million 
the company instituted per participant caps on the amounts of retiree medical benefits it will provide to future retirees at the time it adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to mitigate the impact of medical cost inflation on the company s retiree medical obligation 
the caps do not apply to individuals who retired prior to certain specified dates 
costs in excess of these caps will be paid by plan participants 
the company believes these caps will be exceeded by the end of during  the company announced it would implement increased cost sharing in in the retiree medical coverage provided to current retirees and also announced changes to the retiree health and life insurance benefits it provides to its domestic salaried and non bargained hourly employees 
the company also determined such employees hired on or after january  are not eligible for these benefits 
subject to specific provisions contained in certain of its labor agreements  the company has reserved the right to modify or terminate such benefits at any time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates from its financial instruments 
the company actively monitors its exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the impact of these risks 
see the significant accounting policies derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments notes to the financial statements for additional information 
the company has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
these analyses measure the potential loss in future earnings  cash flows or fair values of market sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
a ten percent decrease in interest rates would have adversely affected the fair value of the company s fixed rate  long term debt by approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  a ten percent increase in the interest rates for the company s floating rate long term debt obligations would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
in october  the company entered into million of interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its percent fixed rate  senior notes to a floating rate based on libor 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates from its short term notes payable issuances is not significant as such notes  which are not material to its financial position at december  and  are issued at current market rates 
at december   the company has derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency denominated intercompany loans 
gains or losses on the foreign currency denominated loans are offset by changes in the values of derivative financial instruments 
to manage the volatility related to currency exchange exposures related to future sales and purchases  the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets 
for the residual portion  the company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options with maturities of less than months pursuant to the company s policies and hedging practices 
the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the fair value of cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the company s unprotected exposures to earnings and cash flow fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not significant at december  and
