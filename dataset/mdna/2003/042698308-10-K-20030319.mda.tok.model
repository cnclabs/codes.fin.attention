results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  the percentages of the net sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s statements of operations 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and marketing general and administrative research and development amortization of goodwill other expense  net ge prucka lump sum commission termination payment income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principal 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income revenue total revenue declined from  in to  in and from  in to  in the  decline in total revenue in was due to two factors 
there was an increase of electrode component sales by  due in part to the introduction of a radio translucent product  offset by a  decline in the sale of computerized medical instruments 
the increase in electrode component sales was the result of an increase in sales of electronic sensors of  or in compared to offset by a decrease in snap sales by  in compared to the decline in total revenue by  in as compared to resulted from several factors 
revenue in included a one time  lump sum payment to buy out a sales commission agreement between art and prucka engineering  inc now ge marquette medical systems  inc net sales of snaps distributed by micron were lower by  in compared to a major customer purchasing snaps directly from the original manufacturer beginning in caused this loss of snap sales 
micron s silver plated and conductive resin sensors for disposable ecg electrodes were  or lower in than in cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of revenues was in compared to in and in excluding the ge prucka termination payment 
the reduction in cost of sales in is primarily attributed to the process improvements that resulted in manufacturing efficiencies 
cost of sales in also includes an impairment charge of  related to obsolete electrode assembly machine parts 
the reduction from to was primarily due to the higher sales mix of snaps in selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased  or in compared to and  or from to this was due primarily to the decision to eliminate direct sales and sales support personnel engaged in promoting art saecg products 
while the conversion of the predictor series to a windows version is complete  the company plans to market this software under license through original equipment manufacturers and expects to avoid future expenses by art on sales and marketing services 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were  lower in than in the savings in resulted from the reduction of administrative payroll from final severance associated with the closing of the texas office  and reductions at the fitchburg office 
even with this reduction the company incurred approximately  of legal expenses and  in other professional and corporate expenses in the year ended december  related to an attempt to acquire certain business assets of a competitor of micron products inc the negotiations to acquire the assets were discontinued in july better containment of legal and other administrative expenses contributed to the reductions as compared to prior years 
general and administrative expenses were  lower in than in the savings in resulted primarily from the severance of three officers of the company in and the assignment of their duties to other management personnel or outside consultants in savings in related to reduced costs associated with the office of the presidency were approximately  reduced costs associated with investor relations and investor related legal costs were approximately  additionally  legal expenses were  less in as a result of the completion of an environmental investigation concerning micron facilities with no adverse actions 
research and development research and development costs decreased from  in   in  to  in due to the termination of art s full time technician and the significant decrease in the use of outside consultants with respect to software development 
included in the  of cost for and  of cost for was the outside programming service used to complete the predictor r conversion 
this cost is not expected to recur in micron spent the remaining  in on its development of a sensor to be marketed in the pacific rim 
funding for future research and development is expected to come from cash provided by ongoing operations 
interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in interest expense of  in   in  and  in is related to the bonds  a majority of which were redeemed in the remaining bonds with a face value of  matured in may interest expense also includes a  annual charge for unutilized borrowing base on our  revolving loan 
other income expense included in other income expense is amortization expense of  in   in  and  in for the discount recorded on the bonds 
the decrease of amortization expense of  in was caused by the early redemption of  of bonds this expense was offset by interest income on the cash and cash equivalents balance 
income taxes income taxes as a percent of income before income taxes was in  in  and in in these years the company had no current federal income tax expense due to net operating loss carryforwards and available deferred tax assets 
the tax expense for   and is for state taxes  principally in massachusetts where micron is located 
earnings per share the company has an ongoing stock repurchase program  which resulted in the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock in the reduction in the number outstanding shares has had the effect of increasing the company s earnings per share as reported 
this decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding has had the effect of increasing the basic earnings per share as reported in by 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was  as of december    at december  and  at december  the  increase in working capital in was mostly attributable to the operating cash flows of  and the maturing of the remaining bond debt in may of the  decrease in working capital in was mainly attributed to  of payments to the early retirement of the principal and repurchase the associated warrants of the bonds in  and the  ge prucka commission agreement termination payment inflating the position in cash and cash equivalents were   and  at december    and respectively 
substantially all these funds are invested in fixed rate bank instruments that are highly liquid 
in addition  the announced program of acquiring the company s common stock resulted in a non operating use of funds aggregating   shares in    shares in  and   shares in the company expanded its stock buy back program on december  authorizing an additional  worth of stock to be purchased from time to time as determined by management based upon market conditions 
inventories increased by  in as compared to  in the increased use of capital to fund inventory is the result of carrying a larger quantity of radio translucent base resin  and manufactured product 
the resin inventory was necessary to adequately insure materials would be readily available for production demands at a reasonable cost 
the increased final product inventory is resulting from lower than expected shipments of radio translucent in  and the remaining inventory increase from the terminated attempt to purchase a competitor 
essentially all of the capital equipment expenditures of   net of disposals in   in and  in were related to the electrode sensor operation at micron 
in  a  decrease in capital equipment relates to the sale of  of attaching machines   long lived asset impairment and other miscellaneous disposals of equipment 
as in prior years  the expected capital expenditures of  for machinery and equipment in in the electrode sensor operation will be derived from net operating cash flows 
the company has a million line of credit with a bank that has been renewed through may there were no borrowings under the line of credit in  or the company anticipates evaluating the line of credit before its renewal again in inflation the company does not believe that inflation in the united states or international markets in recent years has had a significant effect on its results of operations 
factors that may affect future operating results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating the company and its business 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties that the company does not presently know or currently deems immaterial may also impair the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions 
the company could become involved in litigation over intellectual property rights the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
litigation  which would likely result in substantial cost to us  may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
in particular  our competitors and other third parties hold issued patents and are assumed to hold pending patent applications  which may result in claims of infringement against us or other patent litigation 
the company also may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office  which could result in substantial cost  to determine the priority of inventions if trade secrets are not kept confidential  the secrets may be used by others to compete against us micron relies on unpatented trade secrets to protect its proprietary process 
there are no assurances that others will not independently develop or acquire substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary process 
ultimately the meaningful protection of such unpatented proprietary technology cannot be guaranteed 
the company relies on confidentiality agreements with its employees 
remedies for any breach by a party of these confidentiality agreements may not be adequate to prevent such actions 
failure to maintain trade secret protection  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on us 
dependence on a limited number of customers in the fiscal years and  and  respectively of the company s revenues was derived from three customers 
the loss of any one or more of these customers would have an immediate significant adverse effect on our financial results 
in an effort to maintain this customer base  more favorable terms than might otherwise be agreed to could be granted 
currently  the company generally does not receive purchase volume commitments extending beyond several months 
large corporations can shift focus away from a need for our product with little or no warning 
the vast majority of revenues are derived from the sale of a single product in fiscal years and  the company derived and  respectively  of its income from medical electrode sensors for use in disposable electrodes 
while the technology in electrode sensors has been used for many years  there is no assurance that a new patented or unpatented technology might not replace the existing market for disposable electrode sensors 
any substantial technological advance that eliminates our product will have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
a product liability suit could adversely effect on operating results 
the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices of our customers entail the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls 
if our customers are involved in a lawsuit it is foreseeable that the company would also be named 
although  the company maintains product liability insurance  coverage may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive  and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and ability to market product in the future 
the company is subject to stringent environmental regulations 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local requirements governing the protection of the environment 
these environmental regulations include those related to the use  storage  handling  discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in or resulting from the company s manufacturing processes 
failure to comply with environmental law could subject the company to substantial liability or force use to significantly change our manufacturing operations 
in addition  under some of these laws and regulations  the company could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if its properties are contaminated  even if it did not cause the contamination 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of the company s financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes the company is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates the company could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as the company s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled factors that could affect future results 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and present a meaningful presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenues from the sale of products are recorded when the product is shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the purchaser  payment terms are fixed or determinable and payment is reasonably assured 
based on management s on going analysis of accounts receivable balances  and after the initial recognition of the revenue  if an event occurs which adversely affects the ultimate collectibility of the related receivable  management will record an allowance for bad debts 
bad debts have not had a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inventory and inventory reserves the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company reviews its inventory for quantities in excess of production requirements  obsolescence and for compliance with internal quality specifications 
any adjustments to inventory would be equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and expected cost to distribute those products to market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory may be required 
the company maintains a reserve for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value 
a review of inventory on hand is made at least annually and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded 
the review is based on several factors including a current assessment of future product demand  historical experience  and product expiration 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
asset impairment goodwill the company reviews the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets to assess potential impairments 
the management reassesses the useful lives of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the guidelines set forth in fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the value assigned to intangible assets is determined by a valuation based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products acquired from newmark or others in the future 
if the actual sale of product and market acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  management may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 
to test for impairment  a present value of an estimate of future cash flows related to the intangible asset are calculated compared to the value of the intangible asset 
when impairment exists it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
asset impairment long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we generally measure any impairment on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
included in cost of sales for is an impairment charge of  related to machine parts  which were used in the electrode assembly machine leasing business 
the parts were determined to have no future utilization and therefore were fully impaired 
recently issued accounting standards stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure which amends statement of financial accounting standard no

however  it retains the requirement of abp to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of  by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners  or is classified as held for sale 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
included in cost of sales for is an impairment charge of  related to machine parts which were used in the electrode assembly machine leasing business 
the parts were determined to have no future utilization 
goodwill effective january  the company adopted fasb statement no  business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires that the company recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  it also requires  upon adoption of sfas that the company reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in sfas sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas requires that the company identify reporting units for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidelines in sfas sfas is required to be applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
as of january   the company s goodwill of  was composed of  associated with attaching machine assets purchased from newmark  inc in and  associated with the acquisition of micron products inc in as a result of the transitional impairment tests  the goodwill associated with the newmark agreement was determined to be impaired as determined by using the present value of future cash flows solely related to attaching machines 
the balance of   net of tax is being reported as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended december  the diminishing number of leases and sales of attaching machines used for the assembly of disposable medical electrodes in this mature industry lead to the impairment of newmark goodwill 
no adjustment to the  balance of goodwill associated with the micron products acquisition was deemed necessary as of december  the continued effect on reported net income due to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization is as follows reported net income    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  goodwill amortization   adjusted net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and discontinuance of goodwill amortization    basic net income per share as reported

quantification and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is not directly exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as all business is conducted based in us dollars 
however  our foreign customers revenue  expense and capital spending are transacted in their local currencies 
as a result weak  economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our results 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge foreign risk and we believe our allowances are adequate for these risks
