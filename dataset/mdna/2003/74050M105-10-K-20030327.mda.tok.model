item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction premier financial bancorp  inc premier is a multi bank holding company headquartered in huntington  west virginia 
it operates seven community bank subsidiaries ranging in size from million to million  each with a local community name and orientation 
these banks operate in twenty communities within the states of west virginia  ohio and kentucky and provide their customers with a full range of banking services 
premier is also the parent of a data processing subsidiary which provides the data processing and management services for six of premier s affiliate banks and another non affiliated bank 
as of december   premier had approximately million in total assets  million in total loans and million in total deposits 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the management of premier in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the unites states of america 
the audit committee of the board of directors engaged crowe  chizek and company  llp  independent auditors  to audit the consolidated financial statements  and their report is included herein 
financial information appearing throughout this annual report is consistent with that reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is designed to assist readers of the consolidated financial statements in understanding significant changes in premier s financial condition and results of operations 
management s objective of a fair presentation of financial information is achieved through a system of internal accounting controls 
the financial control system of premier is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss and that transactions are properly authorized and recorded in the financial records 
as an integral part of that financial control system  the audit committee of the board of directors engaged arnett foster  cpa s to perform internal audits of the financial records of each of the subsidiaries on a periodic basis 
their findings and recommendations are reported to premier s audit committee as well as the audit committees of the subsidiaries 
also  on a regular periodic basis  the subsidiary banks are examined by federal and state banking authorities for safety and soundness as well as compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations 
the activities of both the internal and external audit functions are reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
summary financial results premier net results for were a loss of million  compared to net income of million reported for the year the loss for is primarily due to large provisions for loan losses  writedowns of repossessed real estate to realizable values  and higher collection costs 
the million earned in was due in large part to gains on the sale of two subsidiary banks 
the earnings in follow million of net income reported for the year ending december  basic earnings per share was a loss of in  compared to income of in and in the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years 
return on average assets roa measures how effectively premier utilizes its assets to produce net income 
premier s net loss for resulted in a roa of  a decrease from the roa reported in and the roa in as shown in the table  the decrease in roa from is attributed primarily to a decrease in gains on sales of assets and subsidiaries 
the decrease in roa versus the years and earlier is primarily due to a decline in net credit income resulting from the high provisions for loan losses in as illustrated in the table  premier s fully taxable net interest income as a percent of average earning assets was the highest in the past three years

as part of this change in strategy  premier elected to dispose of two of its subsidiary banks in on january   the company disposed of all the deposits approximately million  the majority of loans approximately million and the premises and equipment approximately million of the bank of mt 
vernon under the terms of a purchase and assumption agreement 
as a result of this transaction  the banking charter of the bank of mt 
vernon was relinquished and premier agreed not to compete in the markets previously served by the bank of mt 
vernon 
also  on december   the company disposed of certain assets and liabilities of the sabina bank 
the sale included all the loans approximately million and all the deposits approximately million  as well as the premises and equipment approximately million 
certain assets of the bank were retained by premier pending liquidation of the bank  which occurred in the operating results of both the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank were included in premier s and operating results through the respective dates of the sale 
however  s operating results do not include any of the operations of these two banks 
comparisons of average balances and income statement categories are all affected by the disposition of these two subsidiaries 
balance sheet analysis summary a financial institution s primary sources of revenue are generated by its earning assets  while its major expenses are produced by the funding of these assets with interest bearing liabilities 
effective management of these sources and uses of funds is essential in attaining a financial institution s optimal profitability while maintaining a minimum amount of interest rate risk and credit risk

additional information on each of the components of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is contained in the following sections of this report

these were more than offset by a decline in loans in premier s kentucky markets  which were equally split between commercial loans and real estate mortgage loans 
the decrease follows a or million decrease in average total loans from the sale of the bank of mt 
vernon in january  more than offset the increase in average loans resulting from internal growth 
total loans at december   decreased by million or over the total at december  this decrease follows a million or decrease in from total loans at december  as mentioned above  premier sold approximately million in loans in through the sales of the bank of mt 
vernon and the sabina bank 
the decrease in was the result of planned collections of loans retained from the bank of mt 
vernon sale as well as declines in period end loans at premier s kentucky affiliates 
the following table presents a five year comparison of loans by type 
with the exception of those categories included in the comparison  there are no loan concentrations which exceed of total loans 
additionally  premier s loan portfolio contains no loans to foreign borrowers nor does it have a material volume of highly leveraged transaction lending

allocation of allowance for loan losses commercial  other      real estate  construction real estate  other      consumer installment    unallocated    total      loans secured by real estate  which in total constituted approximately of premier s loan portfolio at december   consist of a diverse portfolio of predominately single family residential loans and loans for commercial purposes where real estate is merely collateral  not the primary source of repayment 
collateral for real estate mortgage loans includes residential properties and the loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan based on recent independent appraisals 
the real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also participates in the origination of loans into the secondary market and recognizes the referral fees in non interest income 
commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier s defined market area who are known to the local bank s staff 
consumer loans are made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default 
in addition to the loans presented in the loan summary table  premier also offers certain off balance sheet products such as letters of credit  revolving credit agreements  and other loan commitments 
these products are offered under the same credit standards as the loan portfolio and are included in the risk based capital ratios used by the federal reserve to evaluate capital adequacy 
additional information on off balance sheet commitments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total non performing assets  which consist of past due loans on which interest is not being accrued  foreclosed properties in the process of liquidation oreo  loans with restructured terms to enable a delinquent borrower to repay and accruing loans past due days or more  were million or of total assets at year end the amount is down from the million of non performing assets of total assets at year end but up from the million of non performing assets of total assets at year end the decline since year end was due to a focusing by premier on reducing its high level of non performing assets 
while the level of non performing asset is still high compared to years prior to  the amount of loans past due days or more  restructured loans and oreo each declined during the level of non accrual loans increased due to the deterioration of certain credits in the process of collection 
the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
it is premier s policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
premier had no commitments to provide additional funds on non accrual loans at december  for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations 
during premier recognized million of oreo writedowns compared to  in and  in although loans may be classified as non performing  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than original contracted terms 
during  approximately  of interest was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  while approximately  would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms 
a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the creditor will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial condition and other relevant information that is available 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance for loan losses is allocated to the loan so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cashflows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
additional information on premier s impaired loans is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total year end loans 
this ratio is an increase from the prior year s and the at the end of in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio 
the summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above 
the following table provides a detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years 
the provision for loan losses in was million  down only slightly from the million provision in but up significantly from the million provision in the high level of provision in was in response to management efforts to identify the level of probable incurred losses throughout premier s troubled institutions using the best practices of its higher performing institutions 
the large provision in was in response to the higher risk in certain loans retained by premier as part of the sale of the bank of mt 
vernon and a higher level of net charge off experience 
premier continually evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  and changes in the provision are based on the estimated probable incurred loss of the loan portfolio

the million of net charge offs in was a record high as premier experienced significant increases in consumer and real estate loan charge offs versus the prior year 
although the dollar amount of net charge offs declined in  charge offs could increase in the coming months due to increases in the total level of non accrual loans outstanding or continuing weakness in economic conditions 
these factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which at december  was sufficient to absorb over one and three quarter times the amount of net charge offs experienced in the following table presents the maturity distribution and interest sensitivity of selected loan categories at december  maturities are based upon contractual terms

based upon analyses of asset liability repricing  interest rate forecasts  and liquidity requirements  funds are periodically reinvested in high quality debt securities  which typically mature over a longer period of time 
at the time of purchase  management determines whether the securities will be classified as trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
at december   all of premier s investments were classified as available for sale and carried on the books at market value 
as shown in the following securities maturity and yield analysis table  the average maturity period of the securities available for sale at december  was years months  lengthened somewhat by the year month average final maturity of the mortgage backed securities portfolio

premier s average investment in federal funds sold and other short term investments increased by in this follows a increase in averaging million in  federal funds sold and other short term investments increased million from the million averaged in  and were significantly higher than the million averaged during fluctuations in federal funds sold and other short term investments reflect management s goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure  as discussed in greater detail above and in other sections of this report 
funding sources in  premier once again decreased the rates paid on its interest bearing deposits in response to the declining market interest rate environment 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  down from the paid in and the paid in the decrease is largely due to declines in rates paid on time deposits as higher rate certificates of deposits have either not renewed at maturity or were redeposited at significantly lower rates in conjunction with the sharp decline in the market interest rates 
due to alternative sources of investment and an ever increasing sophistication of customers in funds management techniques to maximize return on their money  competition for funds has become more intense 
premier s banks periodically offer special rate products to attract additional deposits 
premier s deposits  on average  decreased by or million in million or two thirds of this decrease was the result of the sale of the sabina bank late in the decrease compares to a or million decrease in from the average in the approximately million of deposits sold through the bank of mount vernon sale in early more than offset the increase in average deposits from internal growth during non interest bearing deposits decreased by or million on average when compared to the non interest bearing deposits sold through the sale of the sabina bank late in more than offset the increase in average non interest bearing deposits from internal growth during interest bearing deposits decreased by or million on average when compared to approximately half of the decrease was the result of the sale of the sabina bank late in the remaining million decrease was the result of planned non renewals of high rate time deposits which more than offset increases in average interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits 
the following table provides information on the maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  maturity of time deposits  or more december  in thousands maturing months or less  maturing over months through months  maturing over months through months  maturing over months  total  other funding sources for premier include short and long term borrowings 
premier s short term borrowings primarily consist of federal funds purchased from other banks  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with commercial customers 
these short term borrowings fluctuate depending on near term funding needs and as part of premier s management of its asset liability mix 
in  short term borrowings averaged million  down million from the average in only about one eighth of the decline was the result of the sabina bank sale 
the remaining decline was due to reduced short term funding needs at the affiliate banks 
the decline in follows a or million decline in average short term borrowings during this decline was largely due to strong deposit growth in premier s west virginia markets reducing the need for short term funding 
long term borrowings consist of federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings by premier s banks  other borrowings by the parent holding company and debt issued in the form of trust preferred securities 
fhlb advances  on average  declined by or million in  following a or million decrease in premier uses fixed rate fhlb advances from time to time to fund certain residential and commercial loans as well to maximize investment opportunities as part of its interest rate risk management 
at december   fhlb advances totaled million and had repayment schedules from one to thirteen years 
other borrowings  on average  declined by or million in as the parent company began using available funds to aggressively pay down its outstanding debt late in at december   other borrowings totaled million with repayment schedules up to five years 
premier s trust preferred securities represent beneficial interests in the assets of pfbi capital trust nasdaq nms pfbip 
the trust holds million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures subordinated debentures due in quarterly cash distributions on the preferred securities are made to the extent interest on the debentures is received by the trust 
as previously disclosed  pursuant to an agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of cleveland on september  as superceded by an agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland dated january   premier is required to request approval for the payment of distributions due on the trust preferred securities 
during the quarter ended june   premier was notified by the federal reserve bank of cleveland that due to the deterioration of core earnings of the company  among other issues  the frb would not allow the payment of the distribution due june  on premier s trust preferred securities 
in response  premier reached an agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland whereby premier s chairman of the board  who is also its largest shareholder  agreed to loan the company the amount of the distribution   so that premier  with the federal reserve bank s approval  could make the distribution 
the loan is unsecured at a zero interest rate with no defined maturity date 
the loan cannot be repaid without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank 
a similar agreement was reached with for the payment of the distribution due september  premier s president and chief executive officer  who is also a director  agreed to loan the company the amount of the distribution   this loan is also unsecured at a zero interest rate with no defined maturity date 
the loan also cannot be repaid without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of cleveland 
in december  the federal reserve bank of cleveland denied premier s request to make the fourth quarter distribution 
accordingly  premier exercised its right to defer the payment of interest on the subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities for an indefinite period which can be no longer than consecutive quarterly periods 
this and any future deferred distributions will begin to accrue interest at an annual rate of which will be paid when the deferred distributions are ultimately paid 
as part of a debt reduction and profitability plan presented on january  to the federal reserve bank of cleveland federal reserve  premier requested and received approval from the federal reserve to redeem  of the  outstanding trust preferred securities 
the goal of the redemption is to use a portion of premier s outstanding cash on hand to reduce its total interest cost and thus improve profitability 
the redemption will reduce premier s interest cost by approximately  per year 
future early redemptions  if any  will also require federal reserve approval  pursuant to a previously disclosed written agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of cleveland on january   under that same agreement  premier is required to request approval for the payment of quarterly distributions and any accumulated deferrals due on the trust preferred securities 
in response to a separate letter  the federal reserve bank of cleveland denied premier s request to make the first quarter distribution including the accumulated deferral on the remaining trust preferred securities outstanding 
management of premier does not expect to resume payments on the subordinated debentures or the trust preferred until the federal reserve bank of cleveland determines that premier has achieved adequate and sustained levels of profitability to support such payments and approves such payments 
the trust preferred securities have a cumulative provision 
therefore  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  premier intends to continue to accrue the monthly cost of the trust preferred securities as it has since issuance 
premier s management also intends to continue to seek approval of the federal reserve bank of cleveland for payment of the regularly scheduled quarterly distributions on the trust preferred securities and any accumulated deferrals 
asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model prepared by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier s alco guidelines 
another measure of a company s interest sensitivity is the measure of economic value at risk evr 
the evr of a company s balance sheet at a given point in time is the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows 
similar to net interest income  evr can be simulated assuming changes in market interest rates 
the resulting percentage change versus the stable rate evr is an indication of the longer term repricing risk imbedded in the balance sheet 
at december   a basis point increase in rates is estimated to increase premier s evr by while a basis point decrease would also increase premier s evr by 
the percentage changes in evr are within premier s aloc guidelines 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier s deposits and borrowings 
premier s deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier s net assets 
the following table presents summary information about the simulation model s interest rate risk measures and results

base rate the improvement in the simulated change in evr for a basis point decline in interest rates is due to the current low interest rate environment 
the low interest rate environment in limits the change in the market value of liabilities in a declining rate simulation because rates paid on liabilities cannot fall below zero 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to satisfy demands for deposit withdrawals  lending commitments  and other corporate needs 
premier s liquidity is based on the stable nature of consumer core deposits held by the banking subsidiaries 
likewise  additional liquidity is available from holdings of investment securities and short term investments which can be readily converted into cash 
furthermore  premier s banks continue to have the ability to attract short term sources of funds such as federal funds and repurchase agreements 
premier generated million of cash from operations in  which compares to million in and million in these proceeds along with the proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities and the repayment of loans were used to purchase securities  satisfy deposit withdrawals  and reduce outstanding debt during the year 
net cash provided by liquidating investing activities totaled million in and million in in  premier used surplus funds to increase loans and purchase investments 
net cash used to satisfy deposit withdrawals and reduce debt totaled million in and million in in  premier received million in funds from financing activities 
details on the sources and uses of cash can be found in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the parent company had nearly million in cash held with its subsidiary banks 
this balance along with cash dividends received from its subsidiaries is sufficient to cover the operating costs of the parent  service its existing other debt and satisfy the funding for the million trust preferred calling on march  additional information on parent company cash flows and financial statements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio remained strong at during  up from the during and the in the increase in primarily resulted from a decrease in total assets resulting from the sale of the sabina bank in late without a corresponding decrease in equity 
the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s risk adjusted capital to assets ratio was compared to at december  both of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was compared to at december  both of these ratios are well above the recommended to recommended by the federal reserve 
these healthy ratios are the direct result of management s desire to maintain a strong capital position 
additional information on premier s capital ratios and the capital ratios of its larger banks may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary source of funds for dividends paid by premier to its shareholders is the dividends received from its subsidiary banks 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the regulatory agencies 
under these regulations  the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits  as defined  combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years  subject to regulatory capital requirements and additional restrictions more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  premier s banks could  without prior approval  declare and pay to premier dividends of approximately million plus any net profits retained through the date of declaration 
additional information on the capital position of premier is included in the following table

net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million in  down from the amount earned in which follows a decrease in from when net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  interest income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by the amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutory federal tax rate of for companies of premier s size 
the decrease in net interest income in is largely due to the decrease in the volume of assets and liabilities resulting from the sales of the bank of mt 
vernon and the sabina bank in as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  decreases in the volume of earning assets in reduced premier s interest income by million 
this decrease was partially offset by the lower volume of interest bearing liabilities in resulting in a million decline in interest expense 
the net effect was to reduce net interest income by million for the year 
similarly  the lower interest rate environment in resulted in reducing interest income of million and reduced interest expense of million 
however  premier s management of changes in interest rates risk and its ability to lower the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities more rapidly than the declines in yields on interest earning assets resulted in an increase in net interest income from rate movements of million for the year this increase only partially offset the million decline in net interest income due to lower volumes resulting in the overall decline in net interest income 
similarly  in  a reduction in premier s volume of earning assets reduced interest income by million which was only partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense due to a lower volume of interest bearing liabilities 
the net result was a million decrease in net interest income from volume activity 
the lower volumes in were primarily the result of the sale of the bank of mount vernon in january in contrast to however  in  the decline in the yields on earning assets was greater than the decline in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
this resulted in an additional reduction in net interest income of million for a total decline in of million

the net result on all earning assets was to reduce the yield basis points to in  down from earned in and earned in similarly  in premier reduced the average rate paid on its deposits by basis points by not renewing a significant amount of high rate certificates of deposit and by keeping the rates paid on other deposit products competitive with national and local market rates 
the net result on all interest bearing liabilities was to reduce the cost of funds basis points to  down from in and in as a result  premier s net interest spread increased by basis points and its net interest margin increased by basis points to in  up from in and in further discussion of net interest income is included in the section of this report entitled balance sheet analysis 
non interest income and expense non interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving profitability 
recognizing this importance  management continues to evaluate areas where non interest income can be enhanced 
as shown in the table of non interest income and expense below  total fees and other income decreased by or  in approximately of the decline was due sale of the operations of the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank in the remaining decrease was due to declines in other income which was only partially offset by increases in revenue from service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to  in  a or  increase over after factoring out the services charges earned by the two banks that were sold in  service charges in increased by or  over this increase follows a or  decrease in from other income declined by  in largely due the other income reported by the two banks that were sold in and reduced income from origination and sales of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
in  premier realized  in losses on securities sales 
this compares to  in gains realized in and  in losses realized in these securities were sold as part of premier s management of its asset liability position 
in  premier recognized gains of million on the sale of two subsidiary banking operations 
in  premier recognized a gain of  during the second quarter as a result of the sale of a federal home loan bank advance 
this gain was substantially offset by losses on securities of  which also occurred in the second quarter of the following table is a summary of non interest income and expense for each of the years the three year period ending december  non interest income and expense dollars in thousands increase decrease over prior year amount pct amount pct non interest income service charges on deposit accounts    insurance income other    total fees and other income    investment securities gains losses gain on fhlb advance sale gain on sale of banking operations    total non interest income      non interest expense salaries and wages     employee benefits    total staff costs      occupancy and equipment expense    professional fees   taxes  other than payroll  property and income amortization of intangibles    oreo losses and expenses  other expenses     total non interest expenses      just as management continues to evaluate areas where non interest income can be enhanced  it strives to find ways to improve the efficiency of its operations and utilize the economies of scale of the consolidated entity to reduce its operating costs 
premier s net overhead ratio  or non interest expense less non interest income excluding securities transactions and other similar non operating transactions to average earning assets was  a slight decrease from the realized in and the ratio realized in for the year  net overhead was million  a decrease of million or below the overhead of million 
approximately million of this decrease was the net overhead of the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank recognized in whose operations were not included in premier s results for the current year decrease follows a decrease in of or million from the overhead of million 
the sale of the bank of mount vernon in early resulted in a decline in net overhead of million  while the remaining banking operations increased net overhead by  over a lower net overhead ratio means more of the net interest margin flows through as net income 
total non interest expense in decreased by million  or from approximately million of the decline was due sale of the operations of the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank in the remainder was due to a  or decline in the non interest expenses of the remaining operations as described in more detail below 
this year s decrease compares to a million or decrease in versus the sale of the bank of mount vernon in early resulted in a decline in non interest expense of million  while the remaining banking operations increased non interest expense by million over staff costs decreased by million or in versus approximately million of the reduction was due to the sale of the banking operations in the remaining  was largely due to a  decrease in staff costs at the parent holding company  partially offset by normal salary adjustments at the subsidiary banks 
staff costs in decreased million or from the sale of the bank of mount vernon in early resulted in a decline in staff costs of million  while the remaining  increase was due to normal salary and benefit increases 
occupancy and equipment expenses decreased by  or in from approximately  of occupancy and equipment expenses was eliminated due to the sale of the banking operations in the remaining  or increase was largely due to increases in property taxes and maintenance costs on buildings and equipment 
occupancy and equipment expenses in decreased by  or versus the sale of the bank of mount vernon in early resulted in a decline in occupancy and equipment expenses of  while the remaining  or increase was due to normal increases in costs 
professional fees increased by  or in versus approximately  of professional fees was eliminated due to the sale of the banking operation in the remaining  increase was largely due to increased legal fees related to collections  regulatory and compliance matters  other legal matters  and fees related to external audits and premier s efforts to strengthen its internal control processes 
in  professional fees increased  or over  also largely due to increased legal fees related to collections and other matters and internal and external audit costs 
oreo writedowns and expenses totaled million in  an increase of  over the increase in was largely due to writedowns of oreo property to net realizable values as management emphasized efforts to liquidate the properties 
in  premier adopted financial accounting statements fas and the effect of adopting these new accounting standards has been the elimination of the amortization of goodwill effective january in  premier recognized million of goodwill amortization compared to million in additional information concerning premier s adoption of fas and is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses is included in the loan portfolio section of the balance sheet analysis of this report 
applicable income taxes premier recognized a million income tax benefit in compared to million of income tax expense in and  of income tax expense in premier s effective tax rate was in  down from in but up from in the benefit in was due to the pretax loss realized by premier 
premier s effective tax rate in was increased by the benefits of holding tax exempt investments and other tax saving instruments 
the increase in taxes as well as the increased effective tax rate was due to the gains on the sales of the two banking subsidiaries and the taxability of those transactions 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one is that inflation can results in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier s assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier s ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management s efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report 
summary results of operations fourth quarter net income for the three months ended december  was  a million decrease from the  of net income earned during the fourth quarter of however  the fourth quarter of includes a million gain net of tax on the sale of the sabina bank 
excluding this gain  fourth quarter results reflected a loss of  primarily due to million of provisions for loan losses
