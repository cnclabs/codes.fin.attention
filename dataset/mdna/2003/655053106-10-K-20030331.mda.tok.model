critical accounting policies a summary of the critical accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follow below 
property  plant and equipment 
the company s automotive operations are highly capital intensive 
property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided for using the straight line and various accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the company capitalizes interest cost associated with construction in progress 
capitalized interest costs in and were million and million respectively 
the company periodically reviews the realization of long lived assets  based on an evaluation of remaining useful lives and the current and expected future profitability and cash flows related to such assets 
land is carried at acquisition cost 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
because the company operates in different geographic locations  including several state and local tax jurisdictions  the nature of the company s tax provisions and the evaluation of our ability to use all recognized deferred tax assets are complex 
in assessing the ability to realize such deferred tax assets  the company reviews the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the projections of taxable income in future periods and the effectiveness of various tax planning strategies in making assessments 
the consideration of these matters requires significant management judgment in determining deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
while it is believed that the appropriate valuations of deferred tax assets has been made  unforeseen changes in tax legislation  regulatory activities  audit results  operating results  financing strategies  organization structure and other related matters may result in material changes in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
goodwill 
goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and through december  was amortized over a year period on the straight line method 
on january  the company implemented statement of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas goodwill and other intangible assets are no longer amortized 
as required under sfas  management will regularly evaluate the carrying value of businesses and determine if any impairment exists 
as part of the evaluation  the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit to determine whether or not impairment has occurred 
in  the company carried forward its results of its december  tests of its continuing operations as permitted by sfas no

in connection therewith  the company incurred a charge of approximately million primarily as it related to the impairment of goodwill related to its logistics operations 
on march  the company completed the sale of the logistics operations for approximately million in cash and notes 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management makes these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories 
historically  with the exception of million of bad debt expense recorded in  bad debt losses have not been significant or have not differed materially from the company s estimates 
inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the interest expense of floating rate indebtedness and by increasing the cost of labor  fuel  equipment and raw materials 
the company does not believe that inflation has had any material effect on its business over the past three years 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested at least annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
the company adopted sfas on january   and goodwill is no longer amortized 
as of december  the company has goodwill of million  net of million of accumulated amortization 
refer to the discussion in the significant accounting policies section of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and intangible assets 
in october  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  was issued effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  sfas addresses implementation issues associated with sfas and improves financial reporting by establishing one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the company adopted sfas in fiscal year and has accordingly recorded a million charge related to the disposal of its logistics operations which has been included in discontinued operations 
in june  fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
and removes the previous requirement to record a liability for the costs associated with exit activities when a company commits to an exit plan 
sfas now requires a company to record a liability for costs associated with an exit activity  at fair value  only when a liability is incurred 
the company believes that adoption of this standard will have no material effect on its financial statements 
in november  fasb issued interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letter of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company is currently evaluating the provisions of the interpretation  but believes that adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
in december  fasb issued sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure requirements to require disclosure of the method on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements 
the company adopted this statement for the year ending december  which did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in january  fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual return or both 
the consolidation requirements of interpretation apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company is currently evaluating the provisions of the interpretation  but believes its adoption will not have a material impact on its financial statements

international revenues from the company s foreign subsidiaries were approximately of total revenues from continuing operations for fiscal the company s primary foreign currency exposure is the canadian dollar 
the company manages its exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency and  as such  certain exposures are naturally offset
