item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition forward looking statements this report contains statements that may be considered to be forward looking or predictions concerning future operations or events 
such statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are inherently uncertain  subject to risks and should be viewed with caution 
these statements are based on our belief or interpretation of information currently available 
shareholders and prospective investors are cautioned that actual results and future events may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
among all the factors and events that are not within our control and could have a material impact on future operating results include general economic and business conditions  competition and competitive rate fluctuations  cost and availability of diesel fuel  ability to attract and retain qualified drivers  a loss of one or more major customers  interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads  insurance costs and availability  claims expense  retention of key employees  terrorists attacks or actions  acts of war  adverse weather conditions  new or different environmental or other laws and regulations  increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment and the ability of revenue equipment manufacturers to perform in accordance with agreements for guaranteed equipment trade in values 
current and future changes in fuel prices could result in significant fluctuations of quarterly earnings 
the above is not an all inclusive list 
financial and operating results of jbht may fluctuate as a result of these and other risk factors or events as described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement to the extent we become aware that it will not be achieved for any reason 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from estimates 
any effects on business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of assets  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  exposures under self insurance plans and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
however  we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in the financial statement preparation process than others and are discussed below 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise estimates  earnings will be affected 
workers compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of our expenses related to employee injuries workers compensation  vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims 
most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 
the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates 
our current insurance coverage specifies that the self insured limit on the majority of our claims is million  which is prefunded with our insurance carrier 
we are substantially self insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 
our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from our insurance companies to continually update the estimated ultimate cost of each claim 
at december   we had approximately million of estimated net claims payable 
in addition  we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums 
at december   we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately million 
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors  trailers and containers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating leases 
in addition  we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
equipment acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straight line method over the lease term or the estimated useful life  whichever is shorter 
we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or trade in values for certain new equipment acquired since we have utilized these values in accounting for purchased and leased tractors 
if the supplier was unable to perform under the terms of such agreements  it could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported 
accordingly  a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
segments we operated three segments during calendar year segments included truck jbt  intermodal jbi and dedicated contract services dcs 
jbt business included full truck load  dry van freight which is primarily transported utilizing company owned or controlled revenue equipment 
freight in the jbt segment is typically transported over roads and highways and no portion of a movement involves railroads 
the jbi segment includes freight which is transported by rail over at least a portion of the movement 
jbi freight may also include certain repositioning truck loads which are moved by jbi equipment or third party carriers  in circumstances where the movement directs jbi equipment back toward intermodal operations 
dcs segment business usually includes company owned revenue equipment and employee drivers who are assigned to a specific customer  traffic lane or service 
dcs operations most frequently involve formal  written long term agreements which govern services performed and applicable rates 
prior to july   the logistics business segment jbl primarily consisted of jb hunt logistics  a wholly owned subsidiary which provided a wide range of comprehensive transportation and freight management services 
such services included experienced professional managers  information and freight optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of freight system solutions 
jbl utilized jbt  jbi or dcs owned or controlled assets and employees  third party carriers  or a combination of these options to meet service requirements 
jbl services were typically provided in accordance with written long term agreements 
effective july   jbl exchanged its ownership in substantially all of its assets for an initial membership interest in tpi 
as of january   we increased our interest in tpi from approximately to 
results of operations compared with operating segments for years ended december in millions of dollars gross revenue operating income change jbt jbi dcs jbl other subtotal inter segment eliminations total the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing in this annual report 
overview of our consolidated net earnings for calendar year were million  or diluted earnings per share of  compared with full year earnings of million  or cents per diluted share 
we generated million of operating income in  a nearly increase over the million of operating income in our operating ratio was in and in our increase in net earnings was in spite of an effective income tax rate which rose to from in and the number of diluted shares outstanding increasing by nearly 
the increase in shares outstanding reflects a secondary public offering  which closed in june of each of our three segments contributed to the improved earnings levels in jbt segment gross revenue was essentially flat  totaling million in and million in however  revenues were generated with approximately fewer tractors 
in addition  fuel surcharge revenues were million lower than the comparable amount in  which negatively impacted the revenue comparison by approximately 
truck segment operating income rose to million in  from million in the improvement in operating income reflected higher revenue per loaded mile  reduced empty miles and lower driver pay rates 
a significant portion of the higher revenue per loaded mile and reduced empty miles was a result of our continued focus on yield management and improved revenue quality 
the reduction in driver pay per mile was a result of changes in pay scales for newly hired drivers 
jbi segment gross revenue grew  to million in  from million in revenue growth was due  in part  to continued demand for our intermodal service offering and conversion of our container fleet to foot units 
operating income in the jbi segment rose to million in from million in our jbi operating ratio was in and in financial results in this segment were enhanced by improved container utilization  improved driver productivity and a focus on revenue quality 
dcs segment revenue grew nearly  to million in  from million in revenue growth was primarily a result of a increase in the size of the dcs tractor fleet and our focus on improving the quality of individual fleets 
while operating income rose to million in from million in  the segment s operating ratio was in and in we reduced some costs in the dcs segment such as driver pay and overhead  however  higher accident and claims expenses  as well as new project start up costs  more than offset the improvements 
the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of operating revenue percentage change between years vs 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits rents and purchased transportation fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses general and administrative expenses  net of gains communication and utilities total operating expenses operating income interest expense equity in earnings loss of associated companies earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings consolidated operating expenses total operating expenses in increased over  while operating revenues rose 
our operating ratio improved to in  compared with in salaries  wages and employee benefits expense increased in  and declined to of revenue in from in as previously mentioned  a lower mileage pay rate in our jbt segment for newly hired drivers and the use of additional independent contractors were primary contributors to the relationship of this cost category to operating revenues 
partly offsetting a decline in drivers wages relative to revenue were increases in maintenance wages  workers compensation  health insurance and office employee incentive expenses 
we opened some new company managed maintenance facilities and increased our mechanic labor force by about in order to reduce the amount of maintenance that we outsource 
we also experienced higher costs in workers compensation and other fringe benefit programs and paid additional incentive payments to our office and administrative personnel that resulted from improved net earnings 
rents and purchased transportation expense increased  primarily due to the growth of our jbi business segment and the related payments to railroads and drayage carriers and the use of more independent contractors 
the decline in fuel and fuel tax expense was primarily a result of fuel costs per gallon averaging about less vs 
operating supplies and expenses were down in reflecting the reduced amount of outsourced tractor and trailer maintenance work and our focus on reducing travel expenses 
the increase in insurance and claims costs reflects escalating liability insurance premiums which have been experienced industry wide and our higher accident costs 
the significant increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher driver advertising and recruiting expense in and changes in our gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions 
in  we had a million net loss on equipment and facility dispositions  compared with a net gain of million in our net interest expense declined in  partly due to the approximate million of capital we raised through a secondary public offering of common stock which closed in june of we increased our effective income tax rate to in  from in  primarily to reflect additional taxes associated with our increased earnings 
equity in losses of associated companies reflects our share of operating results for tpi and for our mexican joint venture 
amounts included the following years ended december tpi mexican joint venture jbht s financial exposure is limited to its approximate million investment in tpi as we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi s financial obligations 
the year financial results of our mexican joint venture primarily reflect adjustments to the carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our interests 
during the first quarter of  we sold our joint venture interest in mexico for its carrying value  to the majority owner  transportacion maritima mexicana tmm 
we recorded an million note receivable from tmm  which  according to the terms of this sale  will be paid in four annual payments of approximately million  plus interest at per annum  through june of the first payment was received as scheduled in june of compared with operating segments for years ended december in millions of dollars gross revenue operating income change jbt jbi dcs jbl other subtotal inter segment eliminations total as of december   tpi qualified as a reportable business segment for financial reporting purposes 
however  the logistics segment jbl information for shown above excludes tpi 
tpi is accounted for on the equity method and does not qualify as a reporting segment in the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing in this annual report 
overview of financial and operating results for the year were impacted by a number of significant items 
general economic conditions in the transportation industry were soft during the majority of the year and fuel costs varied dramatically  sometimes changing more than from one month to the next 
however  overall fuel costs for were down from the prior year 
consolidated operating revenues for decreased approximately from excluding the jbl operations  which were contributed to tpi as of july   revenue growth for the remaining business segments was approximately 
the growth in the remaining segments is attributable to expansion of our operating fleet of tractors from an average of  in to  in  an average increase of tractors or 
while fuel costs and related fuel surcharge revenues varied significantly during  the net change in fuel surcharge revenue had less than a impact on revenue between and jbt segment revenue totaled million in  down from this decline was due in part to the softer economy that created a reduced demand for freight 
jbt began focusing on improving the operating ratio through cost management initiatives rather than jbt fleet growth 
we had no plans to grow the jbt fleet until such time that a reasonable operating income had been achieved  warranting the additional investment of capital 
jbt tractor count  including independent contractors i c s declined nearly during and tractor utilization was also down approximately 
however  revenue per loaded mile increased  excluding fuel surcharges  reflecting freight mix changes and pure rate increases 
the truck segment generated operating income of million in  compared with a loss of million in as a result of a new initiative commenced in late  the number of i c s in jbt grew to in  from at the end of continued volatility in the earnings power of the truck unit is likely to prevail until supply and demand factors in the truckload industry improve 
additional improvement is significantly dependent upon increases in the availability of freight 
jbi segment business was reasonably strong during and grew to million from million in the intermodal segment held its tractor count essentially flat at during unlike the other segments  growth of jbi is not easily tracked by number of tractors  as jbi can utilize outside dray carriers and the other jbht business units to support load and revenue growth 
the increase in revenue can be attributed to a increase in the number of loads from to  coupled with a increase in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharges 
as a result of revenue growth and utilization of containers  jbi operating income climbed in to million from million in dcs segment revenue grew during  to million from million in this growth rate was down significantly from recent years due to soft economic conditions which made companies more apprehensive about changing or outsourcing their transportation needs  and  our unwillingness to reduce rates to increase market share 
the dcs segment tractor fleet grew by during  but revenue growth was limited by idle tractors throughout most of the year 
dcs generated million of operating income in  compared with million in the lower margin and reduced operating income was primarily a result of idle tractors and a higher proportionate amount of shared trailer pool and corporate support costs being assigned to the business  as a result of improving the tracking of trailer usage and the increased internal transfer price  which is charged by jbt and jbi when dcs utilizes their assigned trailers 
cost control and close analysis of individual fleet profitability remains a dcs objective 
for the year ended december   jbht s share of tpi s results of operations totaled a loss of million  compared with earnings of  for the six month period ended december  tpi s operating loss in was primarily due to start up expenses 
jbht s financial exposure is limited to its approximate million investment in tpi as we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi s financial obligations 
the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of operating revenue percentage change between years vs 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits rents and purchased transportation fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses general and administrative expenses  net of gains communication and utilities total operating expenses operating income interest expense equity in earnings loss of associated companies earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings consolidated operating expenses total operating expenses in declined from  decreasing in relative proportion to operating revenues 
our operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues improved slightly to in from in as previously mentioned  the jbl segment was contributed to tpi effective july  this approximate reduction in consolidated operating revenues was the primary factor in reduced rents and purchased transportation expense 
the jbi segment relied solely on jbt and third party carriers for transportation services and accordingly  purchased transportation costs as a percent of revenue were significantly higher than the other segments 
the decline in fuel and fuel tax expense was primarily due to significantly lower fuel cost per gallon in late the increase in operating supplies and expenses reflected higher tractor and trailing equipment maintenance and tire costs 
insurance and claims costs reflected higher collision rates in jbt during the significant decline in general and administrative expenses was due to an approximate million gain on the sale of a group of trailers  which closed in march of gains on revenue equipment dispositions are included in this expense classification and totaled a net gain of million in  compared with a loss of  in equity in earnings loss of associated companies reflects our share of operating results for tpi and for the mexican joint venture 
equity in earnings amounts included the following year ended december tpi mexican joint venture the year financial results of our mexican joint venture primarily reflected adjustments to the carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our interests 
we had an agreement in principle for a sale to the majority owner of the joint venture 
this transaction was consummated in early liquidity and capital resources cash flow we generate significant amounts of cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in while and reflected a typical level of cash provided by operating activities  was impacted by a significant prepayment for an operating lease which was funded in early cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment 
during the latter part of through late  we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors 
tractor additions since october have been purchased 
the majority of our trailing equipment additions since october have been under operating lease programs 
net cash provided by financing activities in reflects our million secondary stock offering  which closed in june of we discontinued a commercial paper borrowing program during and ceased paying cash dividends in early selected balance sheet data as of december working capital ratio current maturities of long term debt and lease obligations millions total debt and capitalized lease obligations millions total debt to equity total debt as a percentage of total capital from time to time our board of directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock 
purchases of jbht stock were number of shares acquired price range of shares liquidity our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older tractors and trailing equipment with new  late model equipment 
we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions 
we have recently obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering  revolving lines of credit and cash generated from operations 
we have also utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 
as mentioned above  we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors from late through late we started purchasing tractors and containers in october of and plan to continue purchasing tractors and containers in the foreseeable future 
we have been acquiring dry van trailing equipment since october of  primarily under operating lease programs 
we currently expect to spend in the range of million  net of expected proceeds from sale or trade in allowances  on revenue equipment for the full calendar year of we are authorized to borrow up to million under our current revolving lines of credit which expire november  we had no balances outstanding under these lines at december  under the terms of our credit and note agreements  we are required to maintain certain financial covenants including leverage tests  minimum tangible net worth levels and other financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants at december  as of december   we had committed to purchase approximately million of revenue and service equipment  net of proceeds  from sale or trade in allowances 
we believe that our current liquid assets  cash generated from operations and our revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
contractual cash obligations as of december  amounts due by period total one year or less one to three years four to five years after five years operating leases capital leases senior and subordinated notes payable subtotal commitments to acquire revenue equipment total financing commitments as of december  commitments expiring by period total one year or less one to three years four to five years after five years revolving credit arrangements standby letters of credit total risk factors in  we entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately million 
these transactions used a structure that the internal revenue service irs has recently indicated it intends to examine 
we have voluntarily disclosed these transactions to the irs and in october of  the irs began their examination of the specific facts of these transactions 
if the irs challenges our transactions  we intend to vigorously defend them 
however  if the irs successfully challenges these transactions  and is successful in disallowing some or all of the tax benefits that we realized  these actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
our effective income tax rates were  and for the years  and  respectively 
we implemented an accountable expense reimbursement plan for a portion of our drivers in february of driver per diem 
while this plan will generally benefit both jbht and the majority of our drivers  it results in a higher effective income tax rate 
partly as a result of this change and anticipated higher earnings  we are currently estimating an effective income tax rate of to for calendar year in  the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc commenced an action against us in federal district court alleging that we had violated the americans with disabilities act by refusing to hire as truck drivers certain individuals who were taking certain medications 
the eeoc sought injunctive relief and damages for a group of individuals 
the district court dismissed the eeoc s complaint on our motion for summary judgment 
the eeoc appealed this decision to the federal court of appeals 
the federal court of appeals upheld the district court s decision in our favor 
however  the eeoc may still appeal this case to higher courts 
if the higher courts rule against us  we could be subject to a new trial in the district court 
in a separate action filed in michigan in november  by a group of eight former employees  the plaintiffs alleged that we violated the elliott larsen civil rights act of michigan 
in february  we reached an agreement to settle this complaint 
the terms of the settlement are to remain confidential by agreement  however  this contemplated settlement will not materially impact our financial statements or results of operations 
in october  we were assessed a judgment of approximately million for an accident that occurred in august we are currently in dispute over the total value of this judgment and plan to file the appropriate appeals 
we believe  based on advise from outside counsel  that it is probable that this award will be substantially reduced by the appellate court 
however  if we are unsuccessful in our appeal to the appellate court  the ultimate payments to the claimant could have a material effect on our financial statements 
inflation could have a material impact on our business 
a prolonged or unusual period of rising costs could result in fuel  wages  insurance  interest or other costs increasing rapidly and could adversely affect our results of operations if we were unable to increase freight rates accordingly 
the impact of inflation has been minimal during the past three years 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel costs  excess capacity in the trucking industry  surpluses in the market for used equipment  interest rates  fuel taxes  license and registration fees  insurance premiums  self insurance levels and difficulty attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 
we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers 
we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes  some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources that we do 
some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain or retain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain rates or maintain our profit margins 
we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 
our intermodal business segment utilizes a number of railroads in the performance of transportation services 
while the majority of these services are provided pursuant to written agreements with the railroads  the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
if we are unable to retain our key employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we are highly dependent upon the services of a number of our officers and other key employees 
we do not have employment agreements with any of these employees 
the loss of any of their services could have a materially adverse effect on our operations or future profitability 
as part of a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa  a number of heavy duty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions from their engines which were produced subsequent to october  we have not yet had sufficient time to test these new engines 
we will continue to test a limited number of the new epa compliant engines 
in november of  we committed to purchase approximately  new tractors  primarily for our jbi and dcs segments  which will be equipped with mercedes engines 
these engines are not covered by the epa s october  rules 
except for these  tractors  which will be utilized primarily for local and regional operations  we expect to limit new tractor purchases until we are able to complete further testing and evaluation of the epa compliant engines 
in addition  these new epa compliant engines are expected to increase the acquisition and operating costs of these tractors and may negatively impact our future profitability 
fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our third largest general expense category 
during the past three years fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly  with prices frequently changing as much as 
to 
per gallon between consecutive months 
we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers  which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs 
most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel 
however  there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers 
in addition  we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise which cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or out of route miles which cannot be billed to customers 
in february of  fuel prices averaged approximately higher than december of and higher than february of rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
we also record a corresponding asset which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
we were required to adopt sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december   and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term debt 
we from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes  none were outstanding at december  risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if short term market interest rates average more during the next twelve months  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations based on variable rate debt outstanding at december  at december   the fair value of our fixed rate long term obligations approximated carrying value 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
