the gross margin for was as compared to for the primary drivers of the increase in gross profit were higher sales and lower discounts and incentives  partially offset by higher direct labor cost per unit

the events of september  only compounded this difficult market and added to the decline

gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for  a decrease of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the primary drivers of the decrease in gross profit were lower sales  higher discounts and incentives  and higher overhead costs absorbed by each unit

as of december   the company had working capital of  compared to  at december   a  decrease in working capital 
the most significant working capital decrease was a  decrease in cash partially offset by an increase of  in inventories

as of december   the company has a  line of credit with a bank which can be used for working capital purposes secured by equipment  inventory  and receivables 
the interest rate is the prime rate at december  
the line of credit expires september  under this line of credit   has been set aside as an irrevocable standby letter of credit for the company to meet the requirements for self insurance established by the department of industrial relations which regulates workers compensation insurance in california

the company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements through primarily with cash flows from operations  supplemented  if necessary  by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement 
the increase in chassis inventory from the relatively low levels at the december  to december  accounted for most of the operating cash usage  and the company does not anticipate having to increase chassis inventories in depending on market and economic conditions  the company might consider financing part or all of the new facility related to the new motorhome and diesel chassis concept

the contingent liability under repurchase agreements varies significantly from time to time  depending upon shipments and dealer sales to end users 
at december  and  the company s contingent liability was approximately  and  respectively 
the risk of loss under these agreements is spread over numerous dealers and financing institutions and is further reduced by the resale value of any motorhomes that may be repurchased

critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of inventory the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
adjustments to the value of inventory are recorded based upon damage  deterioration  obsolescence and changes in market value 
in determining market value  management has considered its current replacement cost ensuring it does not exceed net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and disposal 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories considering the order backlog and other factors in assessing estimated selling prices and made adjustments to cost of goods sold for estimated decrease in the net realizable value of inventory 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual results 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue primarily from the sale of motorhomes to dealers across the united states 
revenue is recognized when title of the motorhome transfers to the dealer 
this generally occurs upon shipment 
most dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with banks or other financing institutions under which the lender advances all  or substantially all  of the purchase price of the motorhome 
the loan is collateralized by a lien on the purchased motorhome 
as is customary in the industry  the company has entered into repurchase agreements with these lenders 
in general  the repurchase agreements provide that in the event of default by the dealer on its agreement to the lending institution  the company will repurchase the financed motorhome 
revenues are shown net of repurchases 
the company specifically reserves the gross margin for known repurchase obligations quarterly and at fiscal year end 
the company also reserves for dealer sales incentives  which are netted against revenues 
revenues are also generated from the service of motorhomes and from shipment or installation of parts and accessories 
legal accrual the company s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is accrued based on claims for which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  management will assess the potential liability related to the pending litigation and revise the estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operation and financial position 
warranty costs the company provides an estimate for accrued warranty costs at the time a product is sold 
this estimate is based on historical average repair costs  as well as other reasonable assumptions as have been deemed appropriate by management
