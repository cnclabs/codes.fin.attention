on august   fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard will apply to the company effective october  the company does not believe there will be a material effect from the adoption of this new standard

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of this project were to develop one accounting model based on the framework established in statement no 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
statement no 
requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
the provisions of statement no 
will apply to the company effective october  the company does not believe there will be a material effect from the adoption of this new standard 
in june  fasb issued statement no
