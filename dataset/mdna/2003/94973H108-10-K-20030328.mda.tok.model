on april   the company completed its acquisition of methodistcare 
as a result of these completed acquisitions  the company has significantly expanded its operations outside of california 
in order to integrate its acquired businesses and implement the company s regional expansion strategy  the company will need to develop satisfactory networks of hospitals  physicians and other health care service providers  develop distribution channels for its products and successfully convert acquired books of business to the company s existing information systems  which will require continued investments by the company

california legislation enacted since  among other things  establishes an explicit duty on managed care entities to exercise ordinary care in arranging for the provision of medically necessary health care services and establishes a system of independent medical review 
in  texas adopted legislation purporting to make managed care organizations such as the company liable for their failure to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions

the following table depicts management services and other revenue by reportable segment year ended december  in thousands health care   specialty   consolidated   management services and other revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million of management services and other revenue from the rightchoice and cerulean acquisitions  million of which was attributable to the health care segment and million of which was attributable to the specialty segment

in the event a tax liability should arise against which the california foundation has agreed to indemnify wellpoint  there can be no assurance that the california foundation will have sufficient assets to satisfy the liability in full  in which case wellpoint would bear all or a portion of the cost of the liability  which could have a material adverse effect on wellpoint s financial condition

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company s management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect  among other things  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from the amounts previously estimated  which were based on the information available at the time the estimates were made 
the critical accounting policies described below are those that the company believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes that critical accounting policies include medical claims payable  reserves for future policy benefits  intangible assets and goodwill and investments 
medical claims payable medical claims payable include claims in process as well as provisions for the estimate of incurred but not reported claims and provisions for disputed claims obligations 
such estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider  among other things  contractual requirements  historical utilization trends and payment patterns  benefits changes  medical inflation  product mix  seasonality  membership and other relevant factors 
in developing its best estimate of medical claims payable  the company consistently applies the principles and assumptions listed above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because medical claims payable includes various actuarially developed estimates  the company s actual health care services expense may be more or less than the company s previously developed estimates 
claim processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
capitation costs represent monthly fees paid one month in advance to physicians  certain other medical service providers and hospitals in the company s hmo networks as retainers for providing continuing medical care 
the company maintains various programs that provide incentives to physicians  certain other medical service providers and hospitals participating in its hmo networks through the use of risk sharing agreements and other programs 
payments under such agreements are made based on the providers performance in controlling health care costs while providing quality health care 
expenses related to these programs  which are based in part on estimates  are recorded in the period in which the related services are rendered 
the company believes that its reserves for medical claims payable are adequate to satisfy its ultimate claim liability 
however  these estimates are inherently subject to a number of highly variable circumstances 
consequently  the actual results could differ materially from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
health care services and other benefits expense includes the costs of health care services  capitation expenses and expenses related to risk sharing agreements with participating physicians  medical groups and hospitals and incurred losses on the company s disability and life products 
the costs of health care services are accrued as services are rendered  including an estimate for claims incurred but not yet reported 
for many of the company s hmo plans including substantially all of its california hmo plans  the company contracts with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers through capitation fee arrangements as a means to manage health care costs 
the company has two general types of capitation arrangements 
the predominant type is the so called professional capitation arrangement 
under professional capitation arrangements  the company pays the health care provider  such as a participating medical group  a fixed amount per member per month  and the health care provider assumes the risk of the member s utilization of certain specified health care services 
typically  under professional capitation arrangements  the health care provider does not assume the risk of the member s utilization of any hospital based services 
the second type is the so called global capitation arrangement 
under global capitation arrangements  the company also pays the health care provider  such as a participating medical group  a fixed amount per member per month 
however  under global capitation arrangements  the health care provider generally assumes the risk of the member s utilization of all health care services subject to certain limited exceptions and state regulatory requirements 
as of december   and  the company had approximately  and global capitation arrangements  respectively  covering approximately million  million and million member months  respectively 
in addition  one of the company s subsidiaries owns a equity interest in a community health partnership network the chpn operating in the greater atlanta area see item business managed health care networks and provider relations blue cross blue shield of georgia 
the chpn is a locally based equity venture between the company s subsidiary and local physician and hospital groups 
the company s subsidiary has entered into a global capitation arrangement with the chpn 
as of december   and  approximately   and  members  respectively  were covered by this arrangement 
for the years ended december   and  the company s capitation expenses of  million   million and  million represented  and  respectively  of the company s total health care services and other benefits expense 
as of december  and  the company s capitation expenses payable of million and million represented and  respectively  of the company s total medical claims payable 
the company s future results of operations will depend in part on its ability to predict and control health care costs through underwriting criteria  medical management  product design and negotiation of favorable provider and hospital contracts 
the company s ability to contain such costs may be adversely affected by changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  acts of terrorism and bioterrorism or other catastrophes  including war and numerous other factors 
the inability to mitigate any or all of the above listed or other factors may adversely affect the company s future profitability 
reserves for future policy benefits the estimate of reserves for future policy benefits relates to life and disability insurance policies written in connection with health care contracts 
reserves for future life benefit coverage are based on projections of past experience 
reserves for future policy and contract benefits for certain long term disability products and group paid up life products are based upon interest  mortality and morbidity assumptions from published actuarial tables  modified based upon the company s experience 
reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  and as settlements are made or reserves adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
the current portion of reserves for future policy benefits relates to the portion of such reserves that the company expects to pay within one year 
the company believes that its reserves for future policy benefits are adequate to satisfy its ultimate benefit liability 
however  these estimates are inherently subject to a number of highly variable circumstances 
consequently  the actual results could differ materially from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  the reserves for future policy benefits were million and million  respectively 
intangible assets and goodwill the company has made several acquisitions in the past several years that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles in effect through december   these assets were amortized over their useful lives  and were tested periodically to determine if they were recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over their useful lives 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method 
the provisions of sfas no 
also apply to all business combinations consummated after june  sfas no 
 which became effective for fiscal years beginning after december   eliminates amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
rather  these assets are subject to impairment tests at least annually 
the company is required to make estimates of fair value and apply certain assumptions  such as a discount factor in applying these annual impairment tests 
such estimates could produce significantly different results if other assumptions  which could also be considered reasonable  were to be used 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are being amortized using a straight line basis or the timing of related cash flows over periods ranging from five to years 
an intangible asset subject to amortization must be reviewed for impairment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  and  accordingly  no longer amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company completed the transitional evaluation of its goodwill and other intangible assets at january  and the annual evaluation at december   and determined that there was no impairment loss 
as of december  and  total goodwill and other intangible assets were billion and billion  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets 
investments as of december   the company s investment securities at market value  totaled billion  of which was invested in fixed income securities and the remaining was invested in equity securities 
as of december   the company s investment securities at market value totaled billion  of which was invested in fixed income securities and the remaining was invested in equity securities 
these investment securities are generally used to support current operations and  accordingly  have been classified as current assets 
the company s long term investments as of december  and were million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of restricted assets  certain equities and other investments 
total current and long term investments comprised and of total assets as of december  and  respectively 
with the majority of investments in fixed income securities  the company maintains an investment portfolio that is primarily structured to maximize investment income while preserving the principal asset base and provide a source of liquidity for operating needs 
the company records investment income when earned  and realized gains or losses when sold  as determined using the first in first out method 
the company regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to its internal investment guidelines 
the company operates within these guidelines by maintaining a well diversified portfolio  both across and within asset classes 
the company has from time to time retained an independent consultant to advise the company on the appropriateness of its investment policy 
the company performs a quarterly evaluation of its investment securities  using both quantitative and qualitative factors to determine whether a decline in investment value is other than temporary 
when a decline in an investment s fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a loss is recorded against investment income 
when determining whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary  the company considers the extent and duration to which a security s market value has been less than its cost  the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issuer  recommendations and opinions from outside investment managers and the current economic environment 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded investment losses that the company believed to be other than temporary of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company believes that it has performed an adequate review for impairment of the investment portfolio and that investments are carried at fair value 
changing economic and market conditions in the future  however  may cause the company to reassess its judgment regarding impairment  which could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines being charged against future income 
as of december  and  net unrealized gains from the company s fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  primarily resulting from a general decrease in interest rates 
the company had a net unrealized loss in its equity securities portfolio as of december  of million and an unrealized gain of million as of december  the company believes that these fluctuations are temporary as a result of current market conditions

the company s operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal  state and local agencies in all jurisdictions in which the company operates 
many of these agencies have increased their scrutiny of managed health care companies in recent periods or are expected to increase their scrutiny as newly passed legislation becomes effective

there can be no assurance that acting as a government contractor in these circumstances will not increase the risk of heightened scrutiny by such government agencies or that such scrutiny will not have a material adverse effect on the company  either through negative publicity about the company or through an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  profitability from this business may be adversely affected by inadequate premium rate increases due to governmental budgetary issues 
future actions by any regulatory agencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in connection with the rightchoice and cerulean transactions  the company incurred significant additional indebtedness to fund the cash payments made to the acquired companies stockholders 
in addition  the company may incur additional indebtedness to fund some or all of the cash payments to be made in connection with the pending carefirst transaction 
this existing or new indebtedness may result in a significant percentage of the company s cash flow being applied to the payment of interest  and there can be no assurance that the company s operations will generate sufficient future cash flow to service this indebtedness 
the company s current indebtedness  as well as any indebtedness that the company may incur in the future such as indebtedness incurred to fund repurchases of its common stock or to fund the carefirst or other transactions  may adversely affect the company s ability to finance its operations and could limit the company s ability to pursue business opportunities that may be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
completion of the carefirst transaction is subject to a number of conditions  including approval of the insurance regulators in maryland  delaware and the district of columbia 
in addition  one of carefirst s operating affiliates must have its federal charter amended or repealed by the united states congress subject to presidential approval and must obtain approval from the washington  dc corporation counsel 
there can be no assurances that the required approvals will be obtained 
on march   the maryland insurance commissioner issued an order disapproving the conversion of carefirst to a for profit entity 
the company has days from the date of the commissioner s order to appeal the order 
if all conditions to closing are not satisfied on or before november   wellpoint and carefirst will have the right to terminate the amended carefirst merger agreement 
as a result  there can be no assurances that the transaction will be consummated 
as a condition to approval of the carefirst transaction  regulatory agencies may seek to impose requirements or limitations on the way that the combined company conducts it business 
although neither wellpoint nor carefirst is obligated to agree to any material requirements or limitations in order to obtain approval  if either or both companies were to agree to any such conditions  such requirements or limitations or additional costs associated therewith could adversely affect wellpoint s ability to integrate the operations of carefirst with those of wellpoint 
accordingly  a material adverse effect on wellpoint s revenue  results of operations and cash flows following the carefirst transaction could result 
as part of the company s business strategy  the company has acquired substantial operations in new geographic markets over the last seven years 
these businesses  some of which include substantial indemnity based insurance operations  have experienced varying profitability or losses in recent periods 
since the relevant dates of acquisition of cerulean  rightchoice and methodistcare  the company has continued to work extensively on the integration of these businesses 
however  there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate success of the company s integration efforts or regarding the ability of the company to maintain or improve the results of operations of the acquired businesses 
the company has incurred and will  among other things  need to continue to incur considerable expenditures for provider networks  distribution channels and information systems in addition to the costs associated with the integration of these acquisitions 
the integration of these complex businesses may result in  among other things  temporary increases in claims inventory or other service related issues that may negatively affect the company s relationship with its customers and contribute to increased attrition of such customers 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that the company experiences such problems or is otherwise unable to implement fully its expansion strategy 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to capital surplus requirements by the california department of managed health care  the california  georgia and missouri departments of insurance  various other state departments of insurance and the blue cross and blue shield association 
although the company believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with all applicable requirements  there can be no assurances that applicable requirements will not be increased in the future 
from time to time  the company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings  many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business 
the company  like hmos and health insurers generally  excludes certain health care services from coverage under its hmo  ppo and other plans 
the company is  in its ordinary course of business  subject to the claims of its enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict treatment or reimbursement for certain services 
the loss of even one such claim  if it results in a significant punitive damage award  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable settlements of coverage claims 
in june  the california medical association filed a lawsuit in us district court in san francisco against blue cross of california bcc 
the lawsuit alleges that bcc violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico through various misrepresentations to and inappropriate actions against health care providers 
in late  a number of class action lawsuits were brought against several of the company s competitors alleging  among other things  various misrepresentations regarding their health plans and breaches of fiduciary obligations to health plan members 
in august  the company was added as a party to shane v 
humana  et al  a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of health care providers nationwide 
in addition to the rico claims brought in the california medical association lawsuit  this lawsuit also alleges violations of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  federal and state prompt pay regulations and certain common law claims 
in october  the federal judicial panel on multidistrict litigation issued an order consolidating the california medical association lawsuit  the shane lawsuit and various other pending managed care class action lawsuits against other companies before district court judge federico moreno in the southern district of florida for purposes of the pretrial proceedings 
in march  judge moreno dismissed the plaintiffs claims based on violation of rico  although the dismissal was made without prejudice to the plaintiffs ability to subsequently refile their claims 
judge moreno also dismissed  with prejudice  the plaintiffs federal prompt pay law claims 
on march   the california medical association filed an amended complaint in its lawsuit  alleging  among other things  revised rico claims and violations of california law 
on may   judge moreno issued an order requiring that all discovery in the litigation be completed by december  with the exception of discovery related to expert witnesses  which was to be completed by march  in june  the federal court of appeals for the th circuit issued a stay of judge moreno s discovery order  pending a hearing before the court of appeals on the company s appeal of its motion to compel arbitration which had earlier been granted in part and denied in part by judge moreno 
the hearing was held in january and  in march  the court of appeals panel issued an opinion affirming judge moreno s earlier action with respect to the motion to compel arbitration 
the company filed a motion requesting a rehearing of the matter before the entire th circuit court of appeals  which motion was denied by the th circuit court of appeals in june on july   judge moreno issued an order providing that discovery in the case would be allowed to re commence on september  on september   judge moreno issued an additional order certifying a nationwide class of physicians in the shane matter  setting a trial date in may and ordering the parties to participate in non binding mediation

a mediator has been appointed by judge moreno 
in march  the american dental association and three individual dentists filed a lawsuit in us district court in chicago against the company and bcc 
this lawsuit alleges that wellpoint and bcc engaged in conduct that constituted a breach of contract under erisa  trade libel and tortious interference with contractual relations and existing and prospective business expectancies 
the lawsuit seeks class action status 
the company filed a motion which was granted in july with the federal judicial panel on multidistrict litigation requesting that the proceedings in this case be consolidated with a similar action brought against other managed care companies that has been consolidated with the shane lawsuit 
in july  two individual physicians seeking to represent a class of physicians  hospitals and other providers brought suit in the circuit court of madison county  illinois against healthlink  inc  which is now a subsidiary of the company as a result of the rightchoice transaction 
the physicians allege that healthlink breached the contracts with these physicians by engaging in the practices of bundling and down coding in its processing and payment of provider claims 
the relief sought includes an injunction against these practices and damages in an unspecified amount 
this litigation was dismissed without prejudice at the request of the plaintiffs in february a similar lawsuit was brought by physicians including one of the physicians in the case described above in the same court in madison county  illinois  on behalf of a nationwide class of providers who contract with blue cross and blue shield plans against the blue cross and blue shield association and another blue cross blue shield plan 
the complaint recites that it is brought against those entities and their unnamed subsidiaries  licensees  and affiliates  listing a large number of blue cross and blue shield plans  including alliance blue cross blue shield of missouri 
the plaintiffs also allege that the plans have systematically engaged in practices known as short paying  bundling and down coding in their processing and payment of subscriber claims 
blue cross blue shield of missouri has not been formally named or served as a defendant in this suit 
the company s future results will depend in part on its ability to accurately predict health care costs and to control future health care costs through product and benefit design  underwriting criteria  medical management and negotiation of favorable provider contracts 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment and health care practices  inflation  new pharmaceuticals technologies  clusters of high cost cases and numerous other factors are beyond the control of any health plan provider and may adversely affect the company s ability to predict and control health care costs and claims  as well as the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs and limit the company s ability to negotiate favorable rates 
in recent years  large physician practice management companies have experienced extreme financial difficulties  including bankruptcy  which may subject the company to increased credit risk related to provider groups and cause the company to incur duplicative health care services expense 
additionally  the company faces competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates for these programs 
any limitation on the company s ability to increase or maintain its premium levels  design products  implement underwriting criteria or negotiate competitive provider contracts may adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
managed care organizations  both inside and outside california  operate in a highly competitive environment that has undergone significant change in recent years as a result of business consolidations  new strategic alliances  aggressive marketing practices by competitors and other market pressures 
additional increases in competition including competition from market entrants offering internet based products and services could adversely affect the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
the company is dependent on the services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of its health care plans  particularly with respect to individuals  seniors and small employer group members 
such independent agents and brokers are typically not exclusively dedicated to the company and may frequently also market health care plans of the company s competitors 
the company faces intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers 
as a result of the company s acquisitions  the company operates on a select geographic basis nationally and offers a spectrum of health care and specialty products through various risk sharing arrangements 
the company s health care products include a variety of managed care offerings as well as traditional fee for service coverage 
with respect to product type  fee for service products are generally less profitable than managed care products 
a component of the company s expansion strategy is to transition over time the traditional insurance members of the company s acquired businesses to more managed care products 
with respect to the risk sharing nature of products  managed care products that involve greater potential risk to the company generally tend to be more profitable than management services products and those managed care products where the company is able to shift risks to employer groups 
individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase the company s higher risk managed care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures 
typically  government sponsored programs involve the company s higher risk managed care products 
over the past few years  the company has experienced a slight decline in margins in its higher risk managed care products and to a lesser extent on its lower risk managed care and management services products 
this decline is primarily attributable to product mix change  product design  competitive pressure and greater regulatory restrictions applicable to the small employer group market 
from time to time  the company has implemented price increases in certain of its managed care businesses 
while these price increases are intended to improve profitability  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
subsequent unfavorable changes in the relative profitability between the company s various products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and on the continued merits of the company s geographic expansion strategy 
one of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries operates as a pharmacy benefit manager pbm under the trade name wellpoint pharmacy management 
the pbm industry faces a number of risks and uncertainties in addition to those facing the company s core health plan business 
such risks and uncertainties include the application of federal and state anti remuneration laws generally known as anti kickback laws  whether pbms operate as fiduciaries under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and are in compliance with their fiduciary obligations under erisa in connection with the development and implementation of items such as formularies  preferred drug listings and therapeutic intervention programs  and potential liability regarding the use of patient identifiable medical information 
in addition  a number of federal and state legislative proposals are being considered that could affect a variety of pbm industry practices  such as the receipt of rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the company believes that its pbm business is currently being conducted in compliance in all material respects with applicable legal requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s pbm business will not be subject to challenge under various laws and regulations  or that any such challenge will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  future legislative enactments affecting the pbm industry could have a material adverse effect upon the company s results of operations and financial condition 
substantially all of the company s investment assets are in interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities or equity securities 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
in addition  the value of equity securities can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions 
changes in the value of the company s investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  can affect the company s results of operations and stockholders equity 
there can be no assurances that interest rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
the company s operations are dependent on retaining existing employees  attracting additional qualified employees and achieving productivity gains from the company s investment in technology 
the company faces intense competition for qualified information technology personnel and other skilled professionals 
there can be no assurances that an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
prior to the company s acquisition of the gbo  john hancock mutual life insurance company john hancock entered into a number of reinsurance arrangements with respect to personal accident insurance and the occupational accident component of workers compensation insurance  a portion of which was originated through a pool managed by unicover managers  inc under these arrangements  john hancock assumed risks as a reinsurer and transferred certain of such risks to other companies 
these arrangements have become the subject of disputes  including a number of legal proceedings to which john hancock is a party 
the company believes that it has a number of defenses to avoid any ultimate liability with respect to these matters and believes that such liabilities were not transferred to the company as part of the gbo acquisition 
however  if the company were to become subject to such liabilities  the company could suffer losses that might have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company completed its acquisition of certain mail order pharmaceutical service assets and now conducts business as a mail order pharmacy 
the pharmacy business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations which are in many instances different from those under which the company s core health plan business currently operates 
the failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
although the company intends to maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  there can be no assurances that the coverage limits under such insurance programs will be adequate to protect against future claims or that the company will be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
following the terrorist attacks of september   there have been various incidents of suspected bioterrorist activity in the united states 
to date  these incidents have resulted in related isolated incidents of illness and death 
however  federal and state law enforcement officials have issued public warnings about additional potential terrorist activity involving biological and other weapons 
if the united states were to experience more widespread bioterrorist or other attacks  the company s covered medical expenses could rise and the company could experience a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
in april and may  one of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries acting as a pharmacy benefit management business under the trade name wellpoint pharmacy management received two administrative subpoenas duces tecum issued by the us attorney s office in boston massachusetts 
the company does not believe that its pharmacy benefit management business is presently a target of investigation by the us attorney 
the subpoenas appear to focus primarily on wellpoint pharmacy management s relationship with tap pharmaceuticals  including tap s drugs lupron and prevacid 
the company has responded to the subpoenas by producing certain requested documents 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all laws and regulations applicable to the pharmacy benefit management business 
as a result of the general nationwide economic downturn  many states are currently experiencing budget deficits 
state legislators are exploring a variety of alternatives to address this situation 
in order to address the budget shortfalls  various states may propose reductions in payments received by medicaid managed care providers such as the company 
alternatively  state legislators may seek to impose greater state taxes 
any significant reduction in payments received by the company in connection with its medicare managed care business could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  any increase in state taxes could prolong or exacerbate the current economic downturn  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
budget cutbacks could also result in reduced employment levels in public sector accounts for which the company provides insured or administrative services products
