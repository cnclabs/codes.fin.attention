management believes that the new structure will facilitate the acquisition of investment properties from individuals and partnerships 
during all of and the trust owned or controlled fifteen apartment communities containing  apartment units  three multi tenant commercial properties containing  rentable square feet  and two restaurant properties leased to operators under net leases 
five of the apartment properties containing units are owned by separate partnerships that are controlled by the trust through a wholly owned subsidiary 
a description of partnership owned real estate acquisitions is contained in note to the financial statements 
in  the trust registered  shares of beneficial interest which were subsequently offered to holders of an equal number of operating partnership units in the five partnership entities it has controlled  as general partner  since november  as of january   holders of  partnership units  representing of outstanding units  had exercised their exchange options

the  apartment units in the portfolio throughout and contributed and  respectively  of the total revenue from real estate operations  and and  respectively  of real estate operating expenses 
critical accounting policies amortization of management contracts 
in the trust paid  for the general partner interest and absolute management control over five partnerships 
the trust granted to the limited partners in those partnerships options to exchange their interests for shares of beneficial interest of the trust 
those options will expire in november at which time the trust will have the option to issue shares in exchange for any outstanding limited partnership interests 
the trust elected to amortize  on a straight line method  its cost to acquire its position over the ten year option period that it granted to the limited partners  consequently  depreciation expense each year includes  for amortization of the acquisition costs 
carpet replacement policy 
from its inception in  the trust has consistently followed the practice of charging the cost to replace carpets in its apartment units to expense as incurred 
real estate operating expenses include costs to replace carpets of   and  for  and respectively 
an acceptable alternative method of accounting would be the capitalization of costs as incurred  followed by charges for depreciation over the estimated useful life of the carpet 
management believes that  due to the relatively short useful life of apartment carpets  the annual expense for replacements is not materially greater than would be the annual charges for depreciation had the carpets been capitalized when purchased
