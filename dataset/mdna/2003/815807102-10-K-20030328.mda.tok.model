management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  reserves for bad debt and restructuring and impairment charges 
revenue recognition segue s revenue recognition policy follows the guidance prescribed in statement of position sop and statement of position sop 
these call for the residual method of revenue for multi element arrangements when the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is recognized as follows the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vsoe  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with relevant sections of sop and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
segue does a thorough review of the vsoe of undelivered items semi annually 
if the average actual vsoe is substantially different from the standard vsoe  the company adjusts the standards to be more reflective of the actual vsoe 
this change may result in more or less revenue being recognized related to the initial delivery 
to date  the difference between segue s standard vsoe and the actual vsoe has been immaterial and no adjustments have been made 
bad debt reserve on a regular basis  segue reviews its accounts receivable aging to determine which accounts appear to be uncollectible and records an appropriate reserve 
this determination is based on a complete review of all accounts greater than days old and an estimate of default based upon historical rates for all accounts less than days old 
restructuring charges another critical accounting policy relates to the recording of restructuring losses 
segue follows the guidance prescribed in eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
as such  in segue recorded a restructuring charge of million  which included  for a workforce reduction in q and an incremental  for an additional estimated loss on unused space in our lexington and los gatos facilities that resulted from workforce reductions 
refer to note in our consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information 
this estimate for the loss on unused space was based on information that was available at that time 
factors that were included were anticipated rental rates in the commercial office market and the estimated timeframe in which we expected to sublease the space 
segue obtained local real estate market data and consulted with its real estate advisor on these factors to help determine an appropriate reserve for potential losses on the unused space 
during the fourth quarter of  segue was able to reach an agreement in principle with its landlord to restructure the sublease for our lexington facility 
a formal agreement was consumated on january  at december   the accrual balance related to the obligations associated with excess office space in both the lexington and los gatos facilities is approximately million 
this is comprised of an estimated million for future rents payable by segue on unoccupied space  plus  in miscellaneous costs related to subleasing the space  less approximately  of estimated sublease income 
segue is under a restructured sublease for the lexington facility until october year ended december  compared to year ended december  software revenue software revenue results from the granting of perpetual and time based licenses for the use of segue products 
we license our software through our direct sales force  inside sales  international distributors  business partners  and resellers 
software revenue decreased approximately to million in from million in the decrease in software revenue in as compared to was a continued result of the difficult economic environment causing a slowdown of spending on it  and to increased competition 
international product sales accounted for approximately and of segue s total product sales in and  respectively 
the total dollar amount of international product sales decreased by approximately  or 
the decrease in total international sales was due to a general slowdown in it spending 
software revenue growth depends upon our ability to successfully generate and fulfill software license orders  generate incremental revenue from our business partnerships and strategic alliances  attract and retain skilled personnel  deliver timely new products and enhancements and continued market growth 
performance could also be affected by the market acceptance of our new and enhanced products and increased competition 
it is difficult to determine when and if we will be able to grow software revenue in the future 
services revenue services revenue consists of revenue from maintenance  training and consulting 
services revenue decreased approximately to million in from million in maintenance revenue decreased approximately to million in compared to million in training and consulting revenue decreased approximately to million in compared to million in the decrease in training and consulting revenue was mainly due to the continued difficult economic conditions in  which caused a decrease in bookings and delivery of training and consulting engagements 
in  the company began to offer on line training to our customers  which has proven to be successful 
on line training allows the company s customers a flexible option in which to realize the full value of training while keeping expenses  such as travel and lodging  to a minimum 
the decrease in recognized maintenance revenue was driven by the continued difficult economic environment 
lower product sales  which include the sale of new maintenance  and the resistance of some customers to renew maintenance in this economic environment  were the main reasons for the reduction in maintenance revenue 
recognized maintenance revenue is being amortized over the contract period  which is predominately a month period 
it is difficult to determine when and if we will be able to grow training and consulting revenue in the future or if we will be able to renew maintenance contracts at the same level as we have done in the past 
adjustment relating to payment to a customer in  the company committed to making payments totaling million to several vendors  resellers and distributors 
ibm was the largest of these  accounting for million 
under eitf issue no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  these payments are considered to be a reduction of revenue and are presented in our statement of operations as such for there were no other material payments made by the company in or earlier that would be considered for reclassification under the guidance in eitf issue no 
on march   ibm notified us that the infrastructure and systems management division of global services will no longer be selling services for application performance monitoring and scalability testing 
we have been informed that another division within ibm is considering picking up this offering 
upon ibm s final decision  the partnership agreement may be modified to facilitate the new offering 
this could include the return of a portion of the million paid to ibm in april  but there is no obligation to do so 
cost of software cost of software includes documentation  product packaging  product media  employment costs for processing and distribution  amortization of capitalized technology and royalties due to third parties for their software that we embed in our products 
these costs increased by approximately to  representing of software revenue in compared to  or of software revenue  in the major reason for the increase in our cost of software expense was due to the royalties we expensed in that related to our agreement with t plan ltd 
per our agreement with t plan ltd  we expensed  in as compared with only  in the increased royalty expense was offset by reductions in personnel costs and lower fulfillment costs related to lower product sales 
fulfillment costs vary with the amount of product shipped 
cost of services cost of services consists principally of salaries and benefits for our customer service and technical support staff  which staff provides services under maintenance contracts  and for our training and consulting staff  as well as third party consulting fees and the cost of materials and facilities used for training customers 
cost of services as a percentage of services revenue varies based on the profitability of individual consulting engagements and the utilization rate of in house consultants versus the use of higher cost outside contract consultants 
cost of services decreased to million  or of services revenue  in compared to million  or of services revenue  in cost of training and consulting decreased to million in compared to million in the majority of this decrease is a result of lower personnel costs associated with the workforce restructuring actions that were completed in the company also saw large reductions in travel and training  as well as a significant decrease in outsourcing expenses  which are a reflection of the training and consulting revenue decrease 
cost of maintenance decreased to million in from million in lower personnel costs  due to the restructuring that was completed in  were offset slightly by higher phone and data expenses for our northern ireland technical support center 
the company continues to shift support responsibilities to the global technical support center in northern ireland  where operating expenses are generally lower than in the united states 
support costs and personnel levels are continually reviewed in light of maintaining the quality of customer care 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  travel costs and promotional marketing programs 
marketing programs include advertising  public relations  direct mail programs  seminars and trade shows 
total sales and marketing expenses decreased to million  or of net revenue  in compared to million  or of net revenue  in the company realized significant reductions in sales expense for due to reduced personnel costs associated with the restructuring actions that occurred in  lower commissions due to lower revenue  and significantly lower variable expenses such as travel  phone expense  training and seminars 
total sales expense for decreased by to million from million in in addition  the company was able to reduce overall marketing expenses in by to million from million in a decrease in marketing personnel related costs in was a major factor  as well as a significant reduction in marketing programs which includes advertising  promotional materials  creative services and trade shows 
segue will continue to watch the level of expenses for marketing programs  but further reductions to these may have an adverse effect on our business by not creating enough leads to generate sales revenue we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to be a large percent of total expenses for segue  although their percent to total revenue may vary in the future  as we try to grow revenue faster than expenses 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and facility costs 
to date  all of segue s internal costs for research and development have been charged to operations as incurred  since amounts of software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
research and development expenses decreased to million  or of net revenue  in compared to million  or of net revenue in the decreases are attributable mainly to a reduction in personnel related costs due to the impact of the restructuring action  specifically the workforce reductions that occurred in  including the closing of our development lab in california during general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for executive  finance  legal  information technology  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees  system support costs and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of net revenue  in compared to million  or of net revenue  in the decrease in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the following decreased personnel related costs as a result of the restructurings that occurred in  a significant decrease in bad debt expense due to the recovery of several large accounts  reduction in temporary personnel and consulting expenses and reduced travel 
these reductions were offset by an increase in legal expense related to our lease negotiations 
amortization of goodwill goodwill resulted from segue s acquisition of sqlbench in december however  as required by sfas no 
 segue discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective january  during the year ended december   segue performed an initial analysis of the transitional fair value of the goodwill and re evaluated the fair value of the goodwill during the fourth quarter of the analysis demonstrated that no impairment existed at january  or december  and no adjustment was made 
segue will re evaluate the fair value of the goodwill during the fourth quarter of we do not expect any future impairment loss that may occur to exceed million  which amount reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for the year ended december   amortization of goodwill was million

other income expense other income and expense consist primarily of interest income and expense 
interest income from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments amounted to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

there was no tax benefit for losses generated in the united states during and due to the uncertainty of realizing such benefits 
management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence impacting the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  the deferred tax assets have been fully reserved

recognized maintenance revenue is being amortized over the contract period  which is predominately a month period 
cost of software cost of software includes documentation  product packaging  product media  employment costs for processing and distribution  amortization of capitalized technology and royalties due to third parties for their software that we embed in our product

the amortization of the completed technology included in cost of software for and was and  respectively 
additionally  in  the company expensed and wrote off approximately  of prepaid royalties

there was no tax benefit for losses generated in the us during and due to the uncertainty of realizing such benefits

in  the company sold to s associates llc  a company managed and owned by the chairman of segue s board of directors  dr 
james h 
simons s associates   shares of the company s series b preferred stock for a payment of million 
please refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this form k for more detailed financial information about this transaction 
further  in  the company raised approximately  from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan as compared to  in the decrease in the amount of cash from the exercise of stock options is the result of fewer exercises of employee stock options because of segue s lower stock price in in december  we settled certain lawsuits  including both the black white litigation and the securities litigation matter that is referenced in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k  for which we accrued segue s portion of the settlements  approximately  no amounts were paid on these lawsuit settlements in as of may  we had paid the accrued settlement amounts in full 
we have historically had losses 
this  accompanied by the economic downturn of and the slowdown of information technology capital spending  has resulted in lower sales volume  which has required segue to continue utilizing significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents to fund operations 
however  the effects of the steps taken by management have significantly reduced the company s future expected cash outflow 
for the quarter ended december   segue recorded its first quarterly profit since and generated approximately million in positive cashflow 
furthermore  on january   the company received approval to restructure its sublease by returning approximately  square feet in its lexington facility to the landlord 
the restructured sublease will result in a positive cash impact of over  annually for the next years 
pursuant to the terms of the restructuring segue has posted an initial letter of credit for  the cash security of  letter of credit plus that was posted is classified as restricted cash and is reflected in other assets on the company s balance sheet 
this required letter of credit will reduce over time  by formula  to zero by august long term cash requirements  other than for normal operating expenses and those described above  are anticipated for the development of new software products and enhancements of existing products  and the possible acquisition of software products or technologies complementary to our business 
we have reduced our workforce and overhead expenses as described above and curtailed capital spending and other uses of cash 
but  in order to achieve and sustain profitability and to continue positive cashflow from operations  segue must maintain or grow its revenue 
assuming that segue can execute on current plans to maintain or grow revenue through its restructured sales program  its focus on enterprise customers  and its introduction and success of new and enhanced products  and the business climate for it spending does not worsen  we believe that with the funding described above  plus current cash and cash equivalents  that segue will have sufficient resources to meet its working capital and debt requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we are not able to maintain current business levels or the economy worsens  we may need to take other actions in order to fund our working capital requirements 
additionally  the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts  and classification and amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should segue be unable to continue funding its operations 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
factors that may affect future results the company s business is subject to many uncertainties and risks 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities reform act of the company s future results may differ materially from its current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in segue s other filings with the sec 
our quarterly results may fluctuate 
segue s quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly for several reasons  including the timing and success of introductions of our new products or product enhancements or those of our competitors  decline of the general business climate  including uncertainty of it spending  competition and pricing  customer order deferrals or reductions in the size of individual orders as a result of general business conditions  ability to increase sales from enterprise companies  and general economic conditions 
substantial portions of segue s operating expenses are related to personnel  facilities and marketing and sales programs 
the level of spending for such expenses can not be adjusted quickly and is based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenues 
if actual revenue levels are below management s expectations  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected 
furthermore  segue has often recognized a substantial portion of its product revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the latter part of that quarter and revenues from any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
segue typically does not experience order backlog 
for these reasons  segue believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we may not be profitable in the future 
since segue began operations  it has generally experienced losses 
losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  segue had net income of  in  a net loss of million in  which included a charge of  for purchased research and development in process and  for severance charges  a net loss of million in  which included a charge of million related to our acquisitions of eventus and black white  and a charge of  related to write offs of a non recurring engineering fee and guaranteed royalties  a net loss of million in  which included million for restructuring costs   for severance of senior executives  a net loss of million in  which included  for various litigation settlement costs  a loss of million for the year  which included million for restructuring charges  and a net loss of million  including restructuring charges of million for the year in the fourth quarter of  we reported net income of  but it is uncertain whether the company can sustain profitability in the future 
the company also experienced revenue shortfalls in as compared to and during and  we initiated aggressive cost saving measures in an effort to reduce expenses  enhance the possibility of profitability  and conserve cash 
these cost saving measures may not be effective  and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
failure to achieve profitability may adversely affect the market price of segue s common stock 
continued decline in business conditions and information technology it spending could cause further decline in revenue 
the level of future it spending remains very uncertain particularly in light of the continued decline in the business climate throughout if it spending continues to decline  segue s revenues could be further adversely impacted 
segue may not derive substantial incremental revenue from its alliances and silkelite partner program 
in an effort to augment product revenue derived from the efforts of its direct sales force  segue has focused on expanding its key strategic alliances and on building a successful silkelite partner program 
segue has built alliances with peoplesoft  allen systems group  ibm tivoli  and strengthened its ibm alliance 
the silkelite partners program focuses on resellers  consulting partners and distributors 
silkelite partners both resell segue products and use segue software products in the delivery of consulting services 
the success of the key strategic alliances and the silkelite program is uncertain  faces strong competition  and takes time and significant resources to develop 
should segue fail to generate substantial incremental revenue from its strategic alliances or its silkelite program  the financial results and stock price could be adversely affected 
segue may not generate substantial incremental revenue from the expanded relationship with ibm 
in  segue signed an expanded contract with ibm corporation under which segue is the exclusive external provider of software for ibm global infrastructure and systems management services new remote infrastructure analysis offering 
ibm will use segue s monitoring product  silkvision  and segue s enhanced scalability product  silkperformer v 
segue invested significant resources in the alliance  including million in cash to accelerate the availability of the new ibm service offering 
should the ibm service offering not be successful  segue will not generate substantial incremental revenue and its business could be materially adversely affected 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to technological and other market changes  including the successful introduction of new and enhanced products 
the nature of the web based automated software testing and e business testing markets in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology  rapidly evolving customer needs and desires  changes in industry standards and practices and frequent releases of new product or enhancements by competitors 
to be competitive  segue must develop and introduce product enhancements and new products that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and potential customers 
over of segue s product revenue in was generated from its silkperformer and silktest products 
in  we upgraded both the silkperformer and silktest products and also upgraded our new monitoring product  silkvision 
we also introduced silkplan pro  a test management product which we have an exclusive distribution agreement with t plan ltd  a uk based company 
if these new products are not successful or if we fail to continue to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis  or maintain our level of product revenue from silkperformer and silktest  or fail to generate substantial incremental revenue from our new products  our business may be materially adversely affected 
we may face liquidity issues 
we have taken steps to conserve our use of cash  including significantly reducing headcount  infrastructure and other expenses  and limiting capital expenditures in order to compensate in part for our recent decline in revenues  to improve our liquidity and to achieve greater efficiencies 
segue believes that based on expense savings and potential incremental revenue from its strategic alliances  its silkelite partner program  the expanded ibm relationship  and its new products and product enhancements  that future sales will be sufficient to allow us to continue as a viable business 
in the fourth quarter of  we did generate about million in positive cash flow from operations including cash reclassified to restricted cash and shown on the balance sheet in other assets 
total net revenue in declined by approximately from the prior year 
if future sales are not sufficient or revenue continues to decline  however  we may have to raise additional financing to fund working capital needs 
if we fail to generate substantial incremental revenue  or we are not successful in raising additional financing on terms acceptable to segue  we may not have sufficient working capital resources and our business may be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure a liquid market for our stock 
segue has been informed by nasdaq that the company was not in compliance with certain listing requirements for continued listing on their exchange 
in each case  segue was able to take steps to remain in compliance with the listing requirements 
continued compliance with the listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market exchange  and thus a liquid market for our common stock  are closely related to the financial performance of the company 
the company s future business may not be sufficient to assure continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap exchange 
we may have difficulty operating the business efficiently with fewer resources 
beginning in  and continuing through  segue reduced headcount by about and implemented several cost reduction initiatives  including reduced marketing and sales expenses 
segue was able to achieve increased productivity from fewer resources 
segue s ability to increase further its current productivity  as well as sustain current performance with fewer resources  is uncertain 
segue faces significant competition from other software companies 
the market for web based software quality management and testing tools is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify even further in the future 
segue currently encounters competition from a number of public and private companies  including mercury interactive corporation  rational software corporation now part of ibm  compuware corporation and empirix 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
therefore  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share 
such competition and any resulting reduction in profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
segue s business could be adversely affected if its products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or bugs which result in product failures 
the occurrence of errors could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  significant repair and replacement costs  injury to our reputation  or damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel in a difficult economic environment 
qualified personnel remain in demand throughout the software industry 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers and other senior personnel 
the failure to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel that are integral to our direct sales  product development  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
our ability to retain our qualified staff may be further impacted by our financial results during all of this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face many risks associated with international business activities 
we derived approximately of total revenue from international customers in  compared to in the international market for software products is highly competitive and we expect to face substantial competition in this market from established and emerging companies 
segue faces many risks associated with international business activities including currency fluctuations  imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  tailoring of products to local requirements  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
continued growth of international sales is important to growth and the stability of segue 
to the extent we are unable to continue to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 
segue s success depends on our ability to protect our software and other proprietary technology 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from segue s technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technology  these efforts may be inadequate 
we currently rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our products 
currently  we have three issued patents and four pending 
there can be no assurance that these patents would be upheld if challenged 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
if we were to discover that any of segue s products violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms to continue licensing our software without substantial reengineering or that any effort to undertake such reengineering would be successful 
any claim of infringement could cause segue to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract management resources from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or result in an injunction 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
segue is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through its investing and borrowing activities 
in addition  our ability to finance future transactions may be impacted if we are unable to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates 
our investing strategy to manage interest rate exposure is to invest in short term  highly secure and liquid investments 
we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in high grade corporate commercial paper 
foreign currency risk 
segue faces exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge economic exposures or for trading 
historically  our primary exposures have been related to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries 
during  we incurred transaction and re measurement expenses of approximately  related to foreign currency 
the effect of foreign currency transactions and re measurements in and was an expense of  and an immaterial amount  respectively 
as of december   the cumulative translation of foreign currency changes recorded in stockholders equity was  on january   the euro became the local currency for two of our operating subsidiaries  austria and germany 
we anticipate that the impact of the euro will have a larger effect than in the past  as we will have both transactions and translation related to this currency
