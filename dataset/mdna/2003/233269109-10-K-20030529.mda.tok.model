item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statement of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect our operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be required to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition dpac recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we also offer our customers the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
while such returns have historically been insignificant and within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of our reserves is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balances outstanding 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  which could adversely affect our operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale of the related inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
goodwill we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill has possibly occurred 
since we operate in a single business segment as a single business unit  the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based on a comparison of the fair value of the entire company to the carrying value of our net assets 
in estimating the fair value of the entire company  we review the average and closing stock prices for our common stock  as well as other factors 
if the fair value of the entire company is determined to be less than the carrying value of our net assets  we could be required to record an impairment loss for our goodwill that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such charge was recorded 
as of february   the carrying value of our goodwill was approximately million 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
dpac regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
subsequent to the second quarter  we experienced an unexpected decrease on our operating results which continued throughout the second half of the year 
if we continue to operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets which could substantially increase our effective tax rate for such period 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we reversed our valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets which substantially reduced our effective tax rate for such period 
therefore  any significant changes in statutory tax rates or the amount of our valuation allowance could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our reported financial results 
stock based compensation the company accounts for employee stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  as opposed to the optional fair value method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
pursuant to the provisions of apb  we generally do not record an expense for the value of stock based awards granted to employees 
if proposals currently under consideration by various accounting standards organizations and governmental authorities are adopted  we may be required to treat the value of stock based awards granted to employees as compensation expense in the future  which could have a material adverse impact on our reported operating results and could negatively impact the price of our common stock 
if these proposals are adopted  we could decide to reduce the number of stock based awards granted to employees in the future  which could adversely impact our ability to attract qualified candidates or retain existing employees without increasing their cash compensation and  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table summarized dpac s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the three fiscal years ended february  as a percentage of net sales fiscal years ended february  net sales total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development goodwill amortization total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income tax provision income tax provision benefit net income fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year net sales of  increased by  or from fiscal year net sales of  the increase in net sales was primarily due to a change in product mix toward a greater percentage of commercial stacking revenue that contained purchased memory and a lesser percentage containing memory supplied by our customers 
stacking revenues containing purchased memory  or memory stacking  involves dpac purchasing memory chips  stacking them  and then selling the stacked product to the customer 
in these cases where the costs of memory chips are included in the sales price of products  the company will purchase material for the commercial order concurrently with finalizing the sales price thereof  in order to avoid any price volatility in the components 
revenues from memory stacking may vary significantly from period to period based not only on quantities shipped but also on the current market price of purchased memory 
the balance of commercial stacking revenues is from service stacking  where customers provide us with consigned memory chips and we provide services to configure and stack the memory to customer specifications 
as there is no memory chip component cost to service stacking  revenues per unit are significantly lower than revenues per unit of memory stacking sales 
of total revenue in fiscal year  approximately related to memory stacking and to service stacking  as compared with and  respectively  in fiscal year this increase was caused by a change in customer mix  where a higher percentage of our sales were to customers using purchased memory 
the unit quantity of commercial stacks shipped during the year increased by over the previous fiscal year  offset by a decrease in the average selling price of approximately for commercial stacking services 
exclusive of memory content  this resulted in a net decrease in commercial stacking revenues of  or in fiscal year over fiscal year royalty revenues decreased by  during fiscal year export sales represented of total revenue for fiscal year as compared to of revenue for fiscal year  as a european customer established during fy increased sales volume in fy cost of sales for fiscal year was  or of sales  as compared to  or for fiscal year the increase in cost of sales percent is directly related to the increased percentage of revenues from commercial products for which we purchased the memory components 
the cost of purchased memory is passed through to the customer  but does not contain a significant profit element 
thus  while there is not an impact on total margin  the gross margin percent is impacted by purchased memory content 
for fiscal year  approximately  of commercial orders contained procured memory as compared to  for fiscal year the balance of the commercial orders had consigned memory associated with the sale 
additionally  margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in average selling prices discussed above 
we anticipate that average sales prices will continue to decline in fiscal year selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  or in fiscal year to  from  in fiscal year sg a expense  as a percentage of net sales was approximately in both fiscal years 
the increase in dollar amount is primarily attributed to incurred acquisition search costs of  and increased levels of compensation expense  recruitment fees  and insurance premiums 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on march  as a result  the company has ceased amortization of goodwill  reducing annual amortization expense by  amortization of goodwill was in fiscal year and  in fiscal year see new issued accounting pronouncements 
research and development expense was  or of net sales  in fiscal year and  or of net sales in fiscal year this represents an increase of  or in fiscal year from fiscal year the continued investment in research and development is primarily due to continued efforts to allocate resources to the development and production of unique new technologies 
the company is continuing to invest in research and development for new products in the advanced technology marketplace 
see forward looking statements 
interest expense decreased  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the reduced balances of capital leases outstanding during the year 
interest income decreased by  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the decline in interest rates that we were able to earn on our short term investments 
in fiscal year  the company reversed a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets totaling  based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets  the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of  a reduction of goodwill in the amount of  and a net income tax benefit of  this reversal is the result of the company s history of operating profitability and the determination by management that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was judged to be more likely than not 
the company exercises significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
if judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets are not accurate  the company could be required to record additional reserves against deferred tax assets in future periods 
the company had an income tax provision of  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year net sales of  decreased by  or from fiscal year net sales of  primarily due to the decrease in value of the memory content we purchased on behalf of certain customers and included in the related sales 
this decrease was caused by the significant decline in dram component prices experienced throughout fiscal year and was partially offset by the increased unit volume of commercial stacks shipped during the year 
for the commercial high density product  the revenues for products containing the memory components we purchased decreased to of total revenues as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the purchased memory had an established contract price  and therefore did not expose dpac to price volatility risks for memory components 
the unit quantity of commercial stacks shipped during the year increased by over the previous fiscal year  offset by a decrease in the average selling price of approximately for commercial stacking services 
exclusive of memory content  this resulted in a net increase in commercial stacking revenues of  or in fiscal year over fiscal year royalty revenues deceased by  during fiscal year we sold substantially all of the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary  typehaus  in november typehaus generated zero revenues for fiscal year as compared to  or of revenues for fiscal year export sales represented of total revenue for fiscal year as compared to of revenue for fiscal year  as a new european customer accepted our commercial stacking technology 
cost of sales for fiscal year was  or of sales  as compared to  or for fiscal year the decrease in cost of sales percent is directly related to the decreased percentage of revenues from commercial products for which we purchased the memory components 
the cost of purchased memory is passed through to the customer  but does not contain a significant profit element 
thus  while there is not an impact on total margin  the gross margin percent is impacted by purchased memory content 
for fiscal year  approximately  of commercial orders contained procured memory as compared to  for fiscal year the balance of the commercial orders had consigned memory associated with the sale 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by  or in fiscal year to  from  in fiscal year sg a expense  as a percentage of net sales was in both fiscal years 
the decrease in dollar amount is primarily attributed to the reduction in legal expenses associated with defending and prosecuting a patent infringement lawsuit by  see related discussion on the patent litigation and the consolidation of the facility  obtained from the previous year s acquisition  into the garden grove facility during the third quarter of fiscal year additionally  the typehaus subsidiary was sold at the end of the third quarter of  eliminating the associated general and administrative expenses 
amortization of goodwill was  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the increase represents amortization associated with the pep acquisition  which was consummated in the third quarter of fiscal year research and development expense was  or of net sales  in fiscal year and  or of net sales in fiscal year this represents an increase of  or in fiscal year from fiscal year the continued investment in research and development is primarily due to continued efforts to allocate resources to the development and production of unique new technologies 
the company is continuing to invest in research and development for new products in the advanced technology marketplace 
see forward looking statements 
interest expense increased  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the interest rates on outstanding capital leases 
interest income decreased by  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the decline in interest rates that we were able to earn on our short term investments 
other expense in fiscal year of  relates to the loss on disposal of typehaus 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity during the three years ended february  was cash generated from operations 
cash provided by operating activities was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively  and substantially consisted of net income and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash payments related to the pep acquisition consisted of a  payment of an acquired tax liability in fiscal year and  as part of the purchase price in fiscal year cash used for the purchase of manufacturing and test equipment  computers and tooling was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we have commitments for capital expenditures of approximately  in the fiscal year ending february  net cash used in financing activities was  and  in fiscal years and net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal year the primary uses of funds for financing activities consist of principal payments on long term debt of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary sources of funds from financing activities are proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of february   our future commitments under capital leases and term debt through fiscal year were  as of april   we were in compliance with the covenants  terms and conditions of our leases and debt instruments 
additionally  we have an available credit facility with a financial institution  for up to three million dollars  based on eligible accounts receivable 
the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate and expires in november the company must also meet certain financial ratios  which we were in compliance with at february  we ended fiscal year with a cash balance of  working capital of  and a current ratio of to this compares to a cash balance of  working capital of  and a current ratio of to at the end of fiscal year management believes that this positive cash position  together with working capital  cash from operations  and the current credit facility  should be adequate to implement management s business plan and to meet our cash needs for at least the near future 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of revenues from operations  any potential acquisitions  an increase in manufacturing capabilities  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services and growth in personnel and operations 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
if internally generated funds are inadequate  we may scale back expenditures or seek other financing  which might include sales of equity securities that could dilute existing shareholders

sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
sfas will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   as required

in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company expects that the provisions of fin will not have a material impact on its financial statements upon adoption since the company currently has no variable interest entities 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a significant impact on the price of our products  the cost of our materials  or our operating results for any of the three years ended february  risk factors cautionary statements statements in this report that are not historical facts  including all statements about our business strategy or expectations  or information about new and existing products and technologies or market characteristics and conditions  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to  the factors described below which could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
disclosure about terrorist risk we did not experience any direct impact from the september  terrorist attacks on the united states other than minor delays in certain material shipments due to disruptions in the air transportation system 
these delays did not have a material impact on us 
we are unable to estimate or predict what future impact these events will have on us  our customers  our suppliers and the market demand for our products 
any production delays or shutdowns  reduction in demand or loss of customers due to terrorist attacks could have a negative impact on our results of operations and future sales 
product development and technological change the semiconductor and memory module industries are characterized by rapid technological change and are highly competitive with respect to timely product innovation 
our memory and future wireless products are subject to obsolescence or price erosion because semiconductor manufacturers are continuously introducing chips with the same or greater memory density as our custom modules 
as a result  memory products typically have a product life of not more than three to five years 
our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and product enhancements to keep up with technological advances and to meet customer needs 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the company could incur new operating costs with the introduction of new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in planned product development or marketing efforts  or that we will have adequate financial or technical resources for planned product development and promotion 
uncertainty of market acceptance or profitability of new products the introduction of new products  such as our announced product plans for the wireless marketplace  will require the expenditure of an unknown amount of funds for research and development  tooling  manufacturing processes  inventory and marketing 
in order to successfully develop products  we will need to successfully anticipate market needs and may need to overcome rapid technological change and competition 
in order to achieve high volume production  we will need to make substantial investments in inventory and capital equipment or  as currently contemplated  we will need to out source production to third parties or enter into licensing arrangements 
we are inexperienced in the wireless industry  and our plans in that industry are unproven 
we have limited marketing capabilities and resources and are dependent upon internal sales and marketing personnel and a network of independent sales representatives for the marketing and sale of our products 
there can be no assurance that our products will achieve or maintain market acceptance  result in increased revenues  or be profitable 
parts shortages and over supplies and dependence on suppliers the semiconductor industry is characterized by periodic shortages or over supplies of parts that have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our operations 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for semiconductor devices used in our products  and we have no long term supply contracts with any of them 
due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and competitive conditions  we may experience difficulties in meeting our supply requirements in the future 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries of parts  either due to the loss of a supplier or industry wide shortages  could delay shipments of our products  increase our cost of goods sold and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of credit risk we grant credit to customers included in the military  aerospace  and a variety of commercial industries 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and collateral is not required 
estimated credit losses are provided for in the financial statements 
during the year ended february   sales to two major customers accounted for and of net sales 
accounts receivable from these two customers accounted for of total net accounts receivable at february  during the year ended february   sales to three major customers accounted for  and of net sales 
accounts receivable from these three customers accounted for of total accounts receivable at february  during the year ended february   of net sales were to one major customer 
accounts receivable from this customer accounted for of total net accounts receivable at february  a decision by a significant customer to substantially decrease or delay purchases from us or our inability to collect receivables from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on defense related business we have historically derived a portion of our revenues from defense related contracts 
as a result  our business may be impacted by reductions in the federal defense budget and will continue to be subject to risks affecting the defense industry  including changes in governmental appropriations and changes in national defense policies and priorities 
we have reduced  and attempt to continue to reduce  our dependence on defense related business by developing products with commercial applications  although such products generally have lower margins than defense related products  and this adversely affects our results of operations and cash flows 
intellectual property rights our ability to compete effectively is dependent on our proprietary know how  technology and patent rights 
we hold us patents on certain aspects of our three dimensional stacking technology and have applied for additional patents 
there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved  that any issued patents will afford our products any competitive advantage or that any of our products will not be challenged or circumvented by third parties  or that patents issued to others will not adversely affect the sales  development or commercialization of our present or future products 
we are involved from time to time in claims and litigation over intellectual property rights  which may adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
we believe that it may be necessary  from time to time  to initiate litigation against one or more third parties to preserve our intellectual property rights 
in addition  from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights  which claims could result in litigation 
such litigation would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse result in such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of certain products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to use the infringed technology 
such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our failure to obtain a license or our failure to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms could cause us to incur substantial costs and suspend manufacturing products using the infringed technology 
if we obtain a license  we would likely be required to make royalty payments for sales under the license 
such payments would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our gross profit 
in addition  any litigation  whether as plaintiff or as defendant  would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is ultimately determined in our favor 
in addition  the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
management of growth or diversification successful expansion or diversification of the company s operations will depend on the ability to obtain new customers  to attract and retain skilled management and other personnel  to secure adequate sources of supply on commercially reasonable terms and to successfully manage new product introductions 
to manage growth or diversification effectively  we will have to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls 
as we expand or diversify  we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion 
failure to manage growth or diversification effectively could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
competition there are memory companies that offer or are in the process of developing three dimensional products  including chippac  amcor  staktek  samsung  infineon  elpedida and others 
some of such companies have greater financial  manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
we could also experience competition from established and emerging computer memory companies 
there can be no assurance that our products will be competitive with existing or future products  or that we will be able to establish or maintain a profitable price structure for our products 
we expect to face competition from existing competitors and new and emerging companies that may enter our existing or future markets with similar or alternative products  which may be less costly or provide additional features 
in addition  some of our significant suppliers are also our competitors  many of whom have the ability to manufacture competitive products at lower costs as a result of their higher levels of integration 
we also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
competition may arise due to the development of cooperative relationships among our current and potential competitors or third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors will emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products  reduce their prices and introduce new products that may offer greater performance and improved pricing  any of which could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products 
in addition  our competitors may develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that may render our technology or products obsolete or uncompetitive 
product liability in the course of our business  we may be subject to claims for product liability for which our insurance coverage is excluded or inadequate 
variability of gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales was for fiscal year ended february  as compared to for the fiscal year ended february   and for the fiscal year ended february  any change in the gross margins can typically be attributed to the type of products  and the amount of purchased memory included in sales during the year as well as the amount of royalty income generated during the periods 
as we market our products both to military and aerospace  and commercial customers  the product mix that each category of the customers orders may be different and result in changes in the gross margin 
due to the various configuration and applications of our product  prices range from less than for commercial custom modules to over a thousand dollars for high end military specification custom modules 
we expect that our net sales and gross margin may vary significantly based on these and other factors  including the mix of products sold and the manufacturing services provided  the channels through which our products are sold  changes in product selling prices and component costs  the level of manufacturing efficiencies achieved and pricing by competitors 
the selling prices of our products may decline depending upon the price changes of dram  sram and flash semiconductors  which would have a material adverse effect on our net sales and could  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
accordingly  our ability to maintain or increase net sales will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices 
declining product selling prices may also materially and adversely affect our gross margin unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit to offset declines in product selling prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or reduce our cost per unit 
we also expect that our business may experience significant seasonality to the extent it sells a material portion of our products in europe due to vacation cycles and to the extent  our exposure to the personal computer market remains significant 
our average sales prices have historically declined  and we anticipate that the average sales prices for our products will continue to decline and could negatively impact our gross profit margins 
semiconductor companies and oem s are placing increasing price pressure on module manufactures  which in turn  has resulted in downward pricing pressure on our products with certain competitors aggressively reducing prices in an effort to increase market share 
fierce competition among third party suppliers has also increased  at the same time the major semiconductor companies  who are supplying their own stacking solutions with the goal to sell semiconductors  can result in little to no value for the service providers of stacking 
to offset declining average sales prices  we must reduce manufacturing costs and ultimately develop new products with lower costs or higher average sales prices 
if we cannot achieve such cost reductions or product improvements  our gross margins will decline 
decline of demand for product due to downturn of related industries we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to factors affecting the semiconductor  computer  telecommunications and networking industries 
from time to time  each of these industries has experienced downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
a decline or significant shortfall in growth in any one of these industries or a technology shift  could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products  and therefore  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our net sales and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected in the future due to changes in demand from individual customers or cyclical changes in the semiconductor  computer  telecommunications  networking or other industries utilizing our products 
fluctuations in operating results our results of operations and gross margin have been subject to fluctuations from period to period 
the primary factors that have affected and may in the future affect our results of operations  include  adverse changes in the mix of products sold  the inability to procure required components  the size of investments in new technologies or product lines  and the partial or complete loss of a principal customer or the reduction in orders from a customer due to  among other things  excess product inventory accumulation by such customer 
other factors that have affected and may in the future affect our results of operations include fluctuating market demand for and declines in the selling prices of our products  decreases or increases in the costs of the components of our products  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  our competitors selling products that compete with our products at lower prices or on better terms than we sell our products  delays in our the introduction of new products and in our making enhancements to existing products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new product introductions  or our semiconductor customers manufacturing memory custom modules  internally or with other third parties  outside of the united states due to concerns about united states antidumping investigations and laws 
our operating results may also be affected by the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  the timing of significant orders  the ability to produce products in volume  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or other events  inventory obsolescence  including the reduction in value of our inventories due to price declines  unexpected product returns  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  cyclicality in our targeted markets  and expenses associated with acquisitions 
in particular  declines in dram  sram and flash semiconductor prices could affect the valuation of our inventory  the pricing of services  which could result in adverse changes in our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of these same conditions apply to the products being developed for the wireless market 
sales of our individual products and product lines toward the end of a product s life cycle are typically characterized by steep declines in sales  pricing and gross margin  the precise timing of which may be difficult to predict 
we have experienced and could continue to experience unexpected reductions in sales of products as customers anticipate new product purchases 
in addition  to the extent that we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize  or in the event a customer cancels outstanding orders during a period of either declining product selling prices or decreasing demand  we could experience an unanticipated decrease in sales of products 
these factors could give rise to charges for obsolete or excess inventory  returns of products by distributors  or substantial price protection charges or discounts 
in the past  we have had to write down and write off excess or obsolete inventory 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in managing product transitions  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  our customers may purchase products from us in large quantities over a short period of time  which may cause demand for our products to change rapidly 
due to these and other uncertainties associated with semiconductor infrastructure deployments and oems purchasing strategies  we may experience significant fluctuations in demand from our customers 
such fluctuations could cause a significant increase in demand that could exceed our production capacity and could negatively impact our ability to meet customers demands as well as potentially impact product quality 
alternatively  such fluctuations could cause a significant reduction in revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the need for continued significant expenditures for capital equipment purchases  research and development and ongoing customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for us to reduce our operating expenses in any particular period if our expectations for net sales for that period are not met or our investment objective for future revenues streams need to continue for potential success 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to be profitable in any future period 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of good future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock or other securities would be materially and adversely affected 
international sales in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were export sales  primarily to western europe as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal year foreign sales are made in us dollars 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of a significant new international customer in fiscal year and can change from year to year 
international sales may be subject to certain risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  natural disasters  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for telecommunications and other products  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  potentially adverse tax consequences and uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances 
moreover and as a result of currency changes and other factors  certain of our competitors may have the ability to manufacture competitive products in asia at lower costs than we can manufacture them 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products 
we cannot predict whether the united states or other countries will implement quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of our customer s purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from united states laws 
therefore  we may be limited in our ability to enforce any rights under such agreements and to collect damages  if awarded 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited experience in acquisition we may pursue selective acquisitions to complement our internal growth 
if we make any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our shareholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or use other company assets available at the time of acquisition 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses  product lines and technologies 
in addition  the attention of our small management team may be diverted from our core business if we undertake an acquisition 
potential acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including  among others problems assimilating the purchased operations  technologies or products  costs associated with the acquisition  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  sudden market changes  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations  and potential litigation arising from the acquired company s operations before the acquisition 
our inability to overcome problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions could divert the attention of management  utilize scarce corporate resources and harm our business 
in addition  we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
cyclical nature of semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry  including the memory markets in which we compete  is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
furthermore  any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased demand for  and possible shortages of  components we use to manufacture and assemble our products 
such shortages could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
product returns and order cancellation to the extent  we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize  or in the event a customer cancels outstanding orders  we could experience an unanticipated increase in our inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with our customers 
product returns would increase our inventory and reduce our revenues 
we have had to write down inventory in the past for reasons such as obsolescence  excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs 
we have no long term volume commitments from our customers except those subject to cancellation by the customer 
sales of our products are made through individual purchase orders and  in certain cases  are made under master agreements governing the terms and conditions of the relationships 
customers may change  cancel or delay orders with limited or no penalties 
we have experienced cancellations of orders and fluctuations in order levels from period to period and we expect to continue to experience similar cancellations and fluctuations in the future that could result in fluctuations in our revenues 
additional capital funding to impair value of investment if we expand more rapidly than currently anticipated or if our working capital needs exceed our current expectations  we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our research  development  sales and marketing activities 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or will be available on terms favorable to us 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
to the extent  we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our shareholders may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have greater rights  preferences or privileges than our existing common stock 
geographic concentration of operation all of our manufacturing operations are located in our facility in garden grove  california 
due to this geographic concentration  a disruption of our manufacturing operations  resulting from sustained process abnormalities  human error  government intervention or natural disasters such as earthquakes  fires or floods could cause us to cease or limit our manufacturing operations and consequently harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  as the company lease period expires the company may be required to move to new locations  which may present risks associated with such a move 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  waste water discharge  waste storage  treatment and disposal  and remediation of releases of hazardous materials 
our failure to comply with present and future requirements could harm our ability to continue manufacturing our products 
such requirements could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
the imposition of additional or more stringent environmental requirements  the results of future testing at our facilities  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for remediation at other sites where problems are not presently known to us  could result in expenses in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
key personnel the company may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical sales  marketing and managerial personnel required to operate its business successfully 
dpac s future success depends  in part  upon ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with proper skills is intense 
also  attrition in personnel can result from  among other things  changes related to acquisitions  as well as retirement or disability 
the company may not be able to retain existing key technical  sales  marketing and managerial employees or be successful in attracting  assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel in the future 
if the company is unable to retain existing key employees or is unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  business  financial condition and results of operations of dpac could be materially and adversely affected 
stock price volatility the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these price fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
many technology companies  including us  have experienced dramatic volatility in the market prices of their common stock 
if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  our stock price may decline 
we cannot be certain that the market price of our common stock will remain stable in the future 
our stock price may undergo fluctuations that are material  adverse and unrelated to our performance item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests excess cash in money market funds  held primarily in one financial institution 
money market funds do not have maturity dates and do not present a significant market risk 
for fiscal year  interest expense was not sensitive to the general level of the us interest rates because our debt instruments  consisting principally of capital lease agreements  were based on fixed interest rates
