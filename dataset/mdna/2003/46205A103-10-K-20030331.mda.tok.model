item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a network television broadcasting company which owns and operates the largest broadcast television station group in the us  as measured by the number of television households in the markets our stations serve 
we currently own and operate broadcast television stations including three stations we operate under time brokerage agreements  which reach all of the top us markets and of the top us markets 
we operate pax tv  a network that provides family entertainment programming seven days per week and reaches approximately of prime time television households in the us approximately million homes through our broadcast television station group  and pursuant to distribution arrangements with cable and satellite distribution systems and our affiliates 
we were founded in by mr 
paxson  our chairman  chief executive officer and controlling stockholder 
we began by purchasing radio and television stations  and grew to become florida s largest radio station group  while also owning two network affiliated television stations and other television stations that carried principally infomercials and other paid programming 
in  we sold our radio station group and our network affiliated television stations to concentrate on building our owned and operated television station group 
we used the proceeds from the sale of our radio station group and network affiliated television stations to acquire television stations and build the pax tv network 
since commencing our television operations in  we have established the largest owned and operated broadcast television station group in the us  as measured by the number of television households in the markets our stations serve 
we launched pax tv on august   and are now in our fifth network programming season 
in september  nbc invested million in our company 
we have also entered into a number of agreements with nbc that are intended to strengthen our business 
under these agreements  nbc sells our network spot advertising and performs our network research and sales marketing functions 
we have also entered into jsas with nbc with respect to all of our stations serving markets also served by an nbc owned and operated station  and with many independently owned nbc affiliated stations serving markets also served by our stations 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively  for commission compensation and cost reimbursements under our agreements with nbc 
should nbc or the nbc affiliates elect not to renew the agreements under which these operating relationships have been implemented  we could be required to incur significant costs to resume performing the advertising sales and other operating functions currently performed by nbc and our jsa partners or to transfer performance of these functions to another broadcast television station operator and our revenues could be adversely affected during any transition period where we either resume or transfer these functions  which  in each case  could have a material adverse effect upon us 
we derive our revenues from the sale of network spot advertising time  network long form paid programming and station advertising network spot advertising 
we sell commercial air time to advertisers who want to reach the entire nationwide pax tv viewing audience with a single advertisement 
most of our network advertising is sold under advance  or upfront  commitments to purchase advertising time  which are obtained before the beginning of our pax tv programming season 
network advertising rates are significantly affected by audience ratings and our ability to reach audience demographics that are desirable to advertisers 
higher ratings generally will enable us to charge higher rates to advertisers 
we pay commissions of up to of gross revenue to advertising agencies for network advertising 
our network advertising sales represented approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  network long form paid programming 
we sell air time for long form paid programming  consisting primarily of infomercials  during broadcasting hours when we are not airing pax tv 
we pay commissions of up to of gross revenue to advertising agencies for long form paid programming 
our network long form paid programming represented approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  
table of contents station advertising 
we sell commercial air time to advertisers who want to reach the viewing audience in specific geographic markets in which our stations operate 
these advertisers may be local businesses or regional or national advertisers who want to target their advertising in these markets 
station advertising rates are affected by ratings and local market conditions 
we pay commissions of up to of gross revenue to advertising agencies for station advertising sales 
our station advertising sales represented approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  included in station advertising revenue is long form paid programming sold locally or nationally which represented approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  our revenue mix has changed since we launched pax tv in the percentage of our television advertising revenues derived from long form paid programming has declined from more than in to combined network and station long form in the year ended december  due to the increase in spot advertising sales following the launch of pax tv 
long form paid programming  however  continues to represent a significant portion of our revenues 
beginning in january  we modified our programming schedule by replacing network programming during the hours of pm to pm  monday through friday  and pm to pm and pm to midnight  saturday and sunday  with long form paid programming 
as a result  we expect our percentage mix of long form paid programming to increase in to approximately combined network and station long form of our total revenues 
starting in the fourth quarter of  we began entering into jsas with owners of broadcast stations in markets served by our stations 
after implementation of a jsa  we no longer employ our own on site station sales staff 
the jsa partner provides station spot advertising sales management and representation for our stations and we integrate and co locate our station operations with those of our jsa partners 
to date  we have entered into jsas for of our television stations 
our primary operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  programming expenses  employee compensation and costs associated with cable and satellite distribution  ratings services and promotional advertising 
programming amortization is a significant expense and is affected significantly by several factors  including the mix of syndicated versus lower cost original programming as well as the frequency with which programs are aired 
as we acquire a more complete library of lower cost original programming to replace our syndicated programming  our programming amortization expense should decline 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the most significant estimates involved in preparing our financial statements include estimates related to the net realizable value of our programming rights  barter revenue recognition  estimates used in accounting for leases and estimates related to the impairment of long lived assets  fcc licenses and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be critical since they have the greatest impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations and they require significant estimates and judgments 
we carry programming rights assets on our balance sheet at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of our program rights based on anticipated future usage of programming and the anticipated future ratings and related advertising revenues 
we evaluate the net realizable value of our programming rights by aggregating the program costs and related estimated future revenues for each programming daypart 
if estimated future revenues are insufficient to recover the unamortized cost of the programming assets in each daypart  we record an adjustment to write down the value of our assets to net realizable value 
we also evaluate whether future revenues will be sufficient to recover the 
table of contents cost of programs we are committed to purchase in the future  and if estimated future revenues are insufficient  we accrue a loss related to our programming commitments 
our estimates of future advertising revenues are based upon our actual revenues generated currently  adjusted for estimated revenue growth assumptions 
if market conditions were to deteriorate  we may not achieve our estimated future revenues  which could result in future write downs to net realizable value and accrued losses on programming commitments 
we have entered into agreements with satellite television providers and certain cable operators for carriage on their systems in exchange for advertising spots on our network 
we have recorded satellite and cable distribution rights related to these agreements based on the estimated value of the advertising credits at prevailing unit rates in effect at the time these agreements were entered into 
the satellite and cable assets are amortized over the terms of the agreements 
deferred revenue under these barter arrangements is recognized when the spots are aired on our network 
had we used other estimates  our revenues recognized under these agreements may have been different 
we have made judgments and estimates in connection with some of our leasing transactions regarding the estimated useful lives of the assets subject to lease as well as the discount rates used to estimate the present value of future lease payments 
these judgments and estimates have led us to conclude that these leases should be accounted for as operating leases 
had we used different judgments and estimates  these leases may have been classified as capital leases 
the terms of our senior credit facility  senior subordinated note indentures and outstanding preferred stock restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  including our ability to enter into capital leases 
we review our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if our analysis indicates that a possible impairment exists  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset determined either by third party appraisal or estimated discounted future cash flows 
in addition  our fcc licenses and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair values of those assets with their recorded amounts on an aggregate basis as a single reporting unit since we operate pax tv as a consolidated distribution platform 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets  fcc licenses and goodwill have been impaired 
if  however  there were a material change in our determination of fair values or if there were a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize an impairment charge 
in addition  it is possible that the estimated life of certain long lived assets will be reduced significantly in the near term because of the anticipated industry migration from analog to digital broadcasting 
if and when we become aware of such a reduction of useful lives  depreciation expense will be adjusted prospectively to ensure assets are fully depreciated upon migration

television station revenues increased primarily due to increased television spot advertising revenues in our local markets and favorable results from our jsa agreements 
network spot revenues increased and network long form revenues increased compared to primarily due to increased distribution of pax tv 
our revenues during the years ended december  and were negatively affected by the temporary loss and continued impairment of the broadcast signal of our new york television station when our antenna  transmitter and other broadcast equipment were destroyed upon the collapse of the world trade center on september  we are currently broadcasting from towers outside of manhattan at substantially lower height and power 
we expect to begin broadcasting from the empire state building in manhattan during the third quarter of  which will substantially improve our current signal strength and quality 
in addition  we are continuing to evaluate several alternatives for a permanent location  however we expect it could take several years to replace the signal we enjoyed at the world trade center location with a comparable signal 
the loss of a significant portion of our over the air viewership in the new york market has had a negative effect on our revenues as a result of lower ratings for the pax tv network and our station serving the new york market 
we have property and business interruption insurance coverage to mitigate the losses sustained 
insurance recoveries are recognized in the period they become probable of collection and can be reasonably estimated 
to date we have incurred expenditures for property and extra expenses totaling approximately million 
in addition  we estimate our business interruption losses to be approximately million through december  during  we received million of insurance proceeds  million of which related to property extra expense and million related to business interruption 
we are involved 
table of contents in a legal dispute with our insurer over these matters and are presently unable to estimate the amount of additional insurance proceeds we will receive  if any 
programming and broadcast operations expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with million in this increase is primarily due to higher music license fees and tower rent expense for previously owned towers that we sold in program rights amortization expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for the decrease is due to a greater mix of lower cost original programming as compared with as well as the lower carrying value of our programming assets resulting from net realizable value adjustments 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with million for the increase is primarily due to legal costs associated with the nbc arbitration and the mhz spectrum auction  higher advertising expenses associated with the launch of our broadcast season and higher insurance costs 
stock based compensation expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for this decrease is due to a reduction in options vesting in the year ended december  compared with the programming rights adjustment to net realizable value described below was million during the year ended december  compared with million for depreciation and amortization expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for this decrease is due primarily to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  including fcc licenses  be tested for impairment annually rather than amortized over time 
as a result of the new accounting standard  our amortization expense is now significantly lower as we no longer amortize goodwill and fcc license intangible assets 
we have issued options to purchase shares of class a common stock to certain members of management and employees under our stock compensation plans 
as of december   there were  options outstanding under these plans 
in addition to these options  we have granted options to purchase  shares of class a common stock to members of senior management and others 
in connection with option grants  we recognized stock based compensation expense of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in january  we consummated a stock option exchange offer under which we granted to holders who tendered their eligible options in the exchange offer new options under our stock incentive plan  as amended  to purchase one share of our class a common stock for each two shares of our class a common stock issuable upon the exercise of tendered options  at an exercise price of per share 
because the terms of the new options provided for a one business day exercise period  all holders who tendered their eligible options in the exchange offer exercised their new options promptly after the issuance of those new options 
the effect of the stock option exchange was to reduce the number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon the exercise of issued and outstanding options under the existing equity compensation plans by million and increase by million the number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon the exercise of options available for issuance under equity compensation plans approved by security holders 
the stock option exchange will result in a fixed non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million  of which approximately million related to vested shares will be recognized in the first quarter of and the remaining million will be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining one year vesting schedule of the modified award 
in addition  the remaining deferred stock compensation expense associated with the original stock option awards totaling approximately million at december  will be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining one year vesting schedule of the modified awards 
as previously described  effective january  we modified our programming schedule by reducing the number of hours we program the pax tv network primarily during the daytime period and replacing such hours with long form paid programming 
as a result of this change  we no longer plan to air certain syndicated and original programs 
therefore  we revised our estimate of the future advertising revenues to be generated related to these programs and recognized a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to these programming assets 
additionally  as further described below  in the second quarter of 
table of contents we recorded a million accrued programming loss related to programming commitments for touched by an angel 
in  we adjusted our estimate of the anticipated future usage of touched by an angel and certain other syndicated programs and the related advertising revenues expected to be generated and recognized a charge of approximately million related to the net realizable value of these programming assets and related programming commitments 
the charge included a million accrued loss related to programming commitments for future seasons of touched by an angel 
as further described below  in we sublicensed the programming rights to touched by an angel to the hallmark channel 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase is primarily due to a greater level of senior debt due to our refinancings in july and january and borrowings to fund capital expenditures 
at december   total long term debt and senior subordinated notes were million compared with million as of december  although the july and the january refinancings reduced our overall cost of capital  the refinancings increased our debt and reduced our preferred stock  and as a result our interest expense increased in interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the decrease is due to lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
during the year ended december   we sold our television station wpxb serving the merrimack  new hampshire market to nbc for million and realized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
as further described below  during we recorded an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance totaling approximately million resulting from changes in accounting for the amortization of fcc license intangible assets and goodwill upon adoption of sfas years ended december  and net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for this decrease is primarily attributable to lower station revenues offset in part by higher advertising revenues from the pax tv network 
the decrease in television station revenues is primarily due to reduced television spot advertising revenues in our local markets 
the increase in pax tv network advertising revenues resulted from increases in ratings and distribution of pax tv and favorable results from our network sales agreement with nbc 
on an overall basis  network spot revenues increased approximately in resulting from a strong upfront market for the broadcast season 
as previously described  our revenues during the year ended december  were negatively affected by the temporary loss and continued impairment of the broadcast signal of our new york television station when our antenna  transmitter and other broadcast equipment were destroyed upon the collapse of the world trade center on september  the loss of a significant portion of our over the air viewership in the new york market has had a negative effect on our revenues as a result of lower ratings for the pax tv network and our station serving the new york market 
we have property and business interruption insurance coverage to mitigate the losses sustained 
we are involved in legal proceedings with our insurer over these matters and are presently unable to estimate the amount of additional insurance proceeds we will receive  if any 
programming and broadcast operations expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with million in this increase is primarily due to a one time payment to terminate a tower lease and tower rent expense from the sale of certain of our broadcast towers in the fourth quarter of described below 
program rights amortization expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for the decrease is due to syndicated programming changes and a greater mix of lower cost original programming as compared with selling  general and administrative expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with million for the decrease is primarily due to lower selling costs and other cost cutting measures 
time brokerage and affiliation fees were million during the year ended december  compared with million for this decrease is due to the completion of acquisitions of stations we previously operated under time brokerage agreements 
stock based compensation expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for this decrease is due to a reduction in options 
table of contents vesting in the year ended december  compared with the programming rights adjustment to net realizable value described above was million during the year ended december  compared with million for depreciation and amortization expense was million during the year ended december   which was comparable with million for interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase is primarily due to a greater level of debt in resulting from our july refinancing of our preferred stock and senior subordinated notes and borrowings to fund capital expenditures 
at december   total long term debt and senior subordinated notes were million compared with million as of december  interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the decrease is due to lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
during the year ended december   we sold five television stations for aggregate consideration of million and realized pre tax gains of approximately million 
in addition  during  we recognized a million gain from the modification for program rights obligations primarily resulting from our return of certain fully amortized programming rights in exchange for cash of million and the cancellation of our remaining payment obligations 
the series b preferred stock issued in conjunction with the nbc transaction was issued with a conversion price per share that was less than the closing price of the class a common stock on the date of issuance 
as a result  we recognized a beneficial conversion feature in connection with the issuance of the stock equal to the amount of the discount multiplied by the number of shares into which the series b preferred stock is convertible 
in november  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus regarding the accounting for beneficial conversion features which required us to recalculate the beneficial conversion feature utilizing the accounting conversion price rather than the stated conversion price used for this change resulted in a cumulative catch up adjustment totaling approximately million  which was recorded as a preferred stock dividend in the fourth quarter of restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  we approved a restructuring plan to consolidate certain of our operations  reduce personnel by employees and modify our programming schedule in order to significantly reduce our cash operating costs 
these restructuring activities resulted in a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of consisting of million for termination benefits and million of lease termination and other costs 
we have accounted for these costs pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which we early adopted in the fourth quarter of sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
additional restructuring costs  if any  will be recognized in as they are incurred 
through december   we paid termination benefits totaling approximately million to employees and paid million of lease termination and other costs which were charged to the reserve 
we expect these restructuring activities will result in approximately million of annual salary and occupancy cost savings 
during the fourth quarter of  we approved a plan to restructure our television station operations by entering into jsas with owners of broadcast stations in markets in which our stations were not already operating under jsas 
our restructuring plan included two major components termination of station sales and administrative employees and the closing of our leased studio and sales office facilities at each of our stations 
these restructuring activities resulted in a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  consisting of million of termination benefits and million of costs associated with the closing of our studios and sales offices that will no longer be utilized upon implementation of the jsas 
through december   we paid termination benefits to employees totaling approximately million and paid lease termination costs of approximately million  which were charged against the restructuring reserve 
in  we reversed approximately million of restructuring reserves primarily 
table of contents related to four stations which had not entered into jsas and certain other reserves which were no longer required 
in  we reversed approximately million of restructuring reserves primarily related to two other stations which had not entered into jsas and certain other reserves which were no longer required 
we have substantially completed the jsa restructuring except for contractual lease obligations for closed locations  the majority of which expire in as a result of the jsa restructuring  we have reduced our annual station operating expenses by an estimated million consisting primarily of salary and occupancy cost savings of approximately million partially offset by commissions paid to our jsa partners which  based on actual station net revenues  totaled approximately million 
income taxes as previously described  upon adoption of sfas on january   we no longer amortize goodwill and fcc license intangibles 
under previous accounting standards  these assets were being amortized over years 
although the provisions of sfas stipulate that indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized  we are required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for temporary differences related to goodwill and fcc license intangible assets and the tax deductible portion of these assets 
prior to the adoption of sfas  we considered our deferred tax liabilities related to these assets as a source of future taxable income in assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets 
because indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are no longer amortized for financial reporting purposes under sfas  the related deferred tax liabilities will not reverse until some indeterminate future period should the assets become impaired or are disposed of 
therefore  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to fcc license intangible assets and goodwill are no longer considered a source of future taxable income in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 
as a result of this accounting change  we were required to record an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance totaling approximately million for in addition  we will continue to record increases in our valuation allowance in future periods based on increases in the deferred tax liabilities and assets for temporary differences related to goodwill and fcc license intangible assets 
we structured the disposition of our radio division in and our acquisition of television stations during the period following this disposition in a manner that we believed would qualify these transactions as a like kind exchange under section of the internal revenue code and would permit us to defer recognizing for income tax purposes up to approximately million of gain 
the irs is examining our tax return and has issued us a notice of proposed adjustment disallowing all of our gain deferral 
we intend to contest this determination and  based upon the advice of our legal counsel  we believe that it is likely that we will prevail 
we can provide no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
in addition  the irs has issued to us an alternative notice of proposed adjustment that  in the event the irs is unsuccessful in disallowing all of the gain deferral  approximately million of the million gain deferral will be disallowed 
we intend to contest this alternative determination as well  however we can provide no assurance that we will prevail 
should the irs successfully challenge our position and disallow all or part of our gain deferral  because we had net operating losses in the years subsequent to in excess of the amount of the deferred gain  we would not be liable for any tax deficiency  but could be liable for interest on the tax liability for the period prior to the carryback of our net operating losses 
we have estimated the amount of interest for which we could be held liable to be a maximum of approximately million should the irs succeed in disallowing all of the deferred gain 
however  should the irs be successful in disallowing only part of the gain under its alternative proposed adjustment  we estimate we would be liable for only a nominal amount of interest 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to fund capital expenditures for our television properties  programming rights payments and debt service payments 
our primary sources of liquidity are our net working capital and proceeds from the planned sale of certain non core assets which are expected to generate over million in proceeds 
to date  we have completed million of these asset sales  which include the sale of our television station wpxb  serving the merrimack  new hampshire market  to nbc for million  which we completed on october   and the sale of our television station kpxf  serving the fresno  california 
table of contents market  to univision communications  inc for million  which we completed on february  in addition  we have signed definitive agreements with respect to the sale of other broadcast assets which upon closing will result in additional proceeds of approximately million 
these pending asset sales include the sale of our television stations wmpx  serving the portland auburn  maine market  and wpxo  serving the st 
croix  us virgin islands market for an aggregate purchase price of million  the sale of our limited partnership interest in television station wwdp  serving the boston  massachusetts market  for approximately million and the sale of our television station kapx  serving the albuquerque  new mexico market  for million 
we expect to complete the sales of wmpx and wpxo and the sale of our limited partnership interest in wwdp in the second quarter of the kapx sale is subject to regulatory and other approvals 
we believe that cash provided by future operations  net working capital and the proceeds from the planned asset sales will provide the liquidity necessary to meet our obligations and financial commitments for at least the next twelve months 
if we are unable to complete the identified asset sales or our financial results are not as anticipated  we may be required to seek to sell additional assets or raise additional funds through the offering of equity securities in order to generate sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs 
we can provide no assurance that we would be successful in selling assets or raising additional funds if this were to occur 
as of december   we had million in cash and short term investments and working capital of approximately million 
during the year ended december   our cash and short term investments decreased by approximately million and our working capital decreased by approximately million 
these decreases are due primarily to the use of million to pay interest and million to fund operations including programming and cable payments  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of broadcast assets 
cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these amounts primarily reflect payments for interest on our debt and the operating costs incurred in connection with the operation of pax tv and the related programming rights and cable distribution rights payments 
cash used in provided by investing activities was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these amounts primarily include capital expenditures  short term investment transactions  and acquisitions of broadcast properties offset by proceeds from station sales  the sale of our broadcast towers and property insurance proceeds 
as of december   we had agreements to purchase significant assets of broadcast properties totaling approximately million  net of deposits 
we do not anticipate spending any significant amounts to satisfy these commitments until or thereafter 
capital expenditures  which consist primarily of digital conversion costs and purchases of broadcast equipment for our television stations  were approximately million in  million in and million in the fcc has mandated that each licensee of a full power broadcast television station that was allotted a second digital television channel in addition to the current analog channel  complete the construction of digital facilities capable of serving its community of license with a signal of requisite strength by may  and complete the build out of the balance of its full authorized facilities by a later date to be established by the fcc 
despite the current uncertainty that exists in the broadcasting industry with respect to standards for digital broadcast services  planned formats and usage  we have complied and intend to continue to comply with the fcc s timing requirements for the construction of digital television facilities and the broadcast of digital television 
we have commenced migration to digital broadcasting in certain of our markets and will continue to do so throughout the required time period 
we currently have stations broadcasting in digital and expect to have more stations broadcasting in digital by december  we have requested extensions or modifications with respect to of our television stations and are awaiting construction permits from the fcc with respect to nine of our television stations 
nine of our television stations have not received a digital channel allocation and therefore will not be converted until the end of the digital transition 
because of the uncertainty as to standards  formats and usage  we cannot currently predict with reasonable certainty the amount or timing of the expenditures we will likely have to make to complete the digital conversion of our stations 
we currently anticipate  however  that we will spend at least an additional 
table of contents million over the next two to three years to complete the conversion 
we will likely fund our digital conversion from cash on hand and proceeds from our planned asset sales 
during  we sold our television station wpxb  serving the merrimack  new hampshire market  to nbc for million and realized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
during  we sold our interests in five television stations for aggregate consideration of million and realized pre tax gains of approximately million

paxson 
we acquired dp media for aggregate consideration of million  million of which we had previously advanced during dp media s assets included a equity interest in a limited liability company that owns television station wwdp in norwell  massachusetts and is controlled by the former stockholders of dp media 
we allocated the aggregate purchase price of dp media to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair market values 
during the third quarter of  we advanced funds to dp media to fund operating cash flow needs 
as a result of our significant operating relationships with dp media and our funding of dp media s operating cash flow needs  the assets and liabilities of dp media  together with their results of operations  have been included in our consolidated financial statements since september  in december  we completed the sale and leaseback of certain of our tower assets for aggregate proceeds of million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million which has been deferred and will be recognized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
as part of the transaction  we entered into operating leases related to both our analog and digital antennas at these facilities for terms of up to years 
annual rent expense over the lease term is approximately million 
for certain tower assets with a net book value of approximately million  we were temporarily unable to transfer title or assign leases to the buyer at closing 
we expect to complete the majority of these transfers in in the interim  we entered into management agreements with the buyer on terms consistent with the operating leases 
included in the million proceeds was approximately million of deferred consideration for the managed sites which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying december  consolidated balance sheet 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in these amounts include the proceeds from the january and july refinancings described below  as well as the related principal repayments  redemption premiums  preferred stock redemptions and refinancing costs 
also included are proceeds from borrowings to fund capital expenditures and proceeds from stock option exercises  net of principal repayments and preferred stock dividends 
in january  we completed an offering of senior subordinated discount notes due in gross proceeds of the offering totaled approximately million and were used to refinance our exchange debentures due  which were issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of our exchangeable preferred stock on january   and to pay costs related to the offering 
the notes were sold at a discount of  which represents a yield to maturity of 
cash interest on the notes will be payable semi annually beginning on july  the senior subordinated discount notes are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
we recognized an extraordinary loss due to early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately million in resulting primarily from the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt costs associated with the repayment of the exchange debentures 
on july   we completed a million financing consisting of a million senior credit facility and million of senior subordinated notes due proceeds from the initial funding under the 
table of contents senior credit facility and the senior subordinated notes offering were used to repay all of our indebtedness and obligations under our previously existing credit facilities  which were scheduled to mature in june  to redeem our senior subordinated notes and our redeemable preferred stock and to pay redemption premiums  fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing 
in  we recognized an extraordinary loss related to early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately million resulting primarily from the write off of unamortized debt costs related to the refinanced indebtedness and the redemption premium and costs associated with the repayment of the senior subordinated notes 
the million senior credit facility consists of a fully drawn million revolving credit facility maturing june  a million delayed draw term a facility maturing december  of which million was outstanding at december   and a million fully drawn term b facility maturing june  of which million remained outstanding at december  the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and the term a facility is available to fund capital expenditures

the senior subordinated notes are due in and interest on the notes is payable on january and july of each year 
we have entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap in the notional amount of million to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of our variable rate indebtedness 
the fixed rate under the swap is and variable rates are indexed to libor 
including the impact of the swap  the weighted average interest rate of our indebtedness at december  was 
the terms of the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes contain covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness except for specified indebtedness related to the funding of capital expenditures and refinancing indebtedness 
in addition  our senior credit facility also contains covenants restricting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  dispose of assets  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness  create liens  make capital expenditures  make certain investments or acquisitions and enter into transactions with affiliates and otherwise restricting our activities 
on june   we and our lenders amended our senior credit facility to  among other things  reduce the minimum required levels of net revenues and ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility and summarized below for certain periods under the facility s financial covenants and allow us to retain the proceeds from certain planned asset sales for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the amendment  the interest rates were increased to libor plus or base rate as defined plus  at our option  and we paid an amendment fee of million 
on november   we and our lenders amended our senior credit facility to  among other things  exclude from the definition of ebitda certain costs resulting from our plan to consolidate certain of our operations  reduce personnel and modify our programming schedule 
in connection with this amendment  we incurred costs of approximately million 
our senior credit facility  as amended  contains the following financial covenants twelve month trailing minimum net revenue and minimum ebitda for each of the fiscal quarters ended june  through december   maximum ratio of total senior debt to ebitda  maximum ratio of total debt to ebitda  minimum permitted interest coverage ratio and minimum permitted fixed charge coverage ratio  each beginning for each of the fiscal quarters ending on or after march   maximum annual capital expenditures for through and maximum annual programming payments for through ebitda  as defined under our senior credit facility  is equal to our consolidated net loss plus the sum of interest expense net of interest income  depreciation  amortization excluding programming amortization  stock based compensation  permitted programming net realizable value adjustments  permitted restructuring and other charges  time brokerage and affiliation fees  losses on the sale of assets and other non cash expenses minus the sum of gains on the sale of assets and other non cash income 
in addition  ebitda  as defined  is adjusted to give effect to acquisitions or dispositions of television stations as if they occurred at the beginning of the period they were consummated 
for the year ended december   our net revenues and ebitda  as defined  exceeded our covenant minimum net revenues and ebitda under our senior credit facility for the period 

table of contents our twelve month trailing minimum net revenue and ebitda covenants  as amended  for the next four quarters are as follows in thousands fiscal quarter ending minimum net revenues minimum ebitda march  june  september  december  on march   we obtained a waiver from our lenders under our senior credit facility whereby our lenders waived compliance with respect to our twelve month trailing minimum net revenue covenants for each of the fiscal quarters ended june  september and december   subject to a minimum million net revenue floor in each period 
failure to meet the minimum net revenue covenants in these waiver periods will result in a fee equal to of the outstanding principal amount under the facility for each period subject to the waiver  provided our net revenues are not less than the million waiver floor 
in connection with the waiver  we paid an upfront fee of approximately million 
our ability to meet these financial covenants is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which is our ability to generate revenues which in turn is affected by overall conditions in the television advertising marketplace  our network and station ratings and the success of our jsa strategy and cost cutting initiatives 
at december   we were in compliance with these amended covenants 
although we currently expect to meet these amended covenants through the end of fiscal  adverse developments with respect to these or other factors could result in our failing to meet one or more of these covenants 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these covenants in future periods 
as previously described  we have received a waiver from our lenders for our minimum net revenue covenant for the trailing twelve month periods ended june  september and december  provided our net revenues are not less than million for each period 
if we were to violate any of these covenants and or the terms of our march waiver  we would be required to seek an additional waiver from our lenders under our senior credit facility and possibly seek another amendment to our senior credit facility 
we can provide no assurance that the lenders under our senior credit facility would grant us any waiver or amendment which might become necessary 
if we failed to meet any of our debt covenants and our lenders did not grant a waiver or amend our facility  they would have the right to declare an event of default and seek remedies including acceleration of all outstanding amounts due under the senior credit facility 
should an event of default be declared under the senior credit facility  this would cause a cross default to occur under the senior subordinated note and senior subordinated discount note indentures  thus giving each trustee the right to accelerate repayment  and would give the holders of each of our three outstanding series of preferred stock the right to elect two directors per series to our board of directors 
we can provide no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining alternative sources of funding to repay these obligations should these events occur

table of contents under the terms of our programming contracts  as of december  we have committed to pay for certain programs for which we currently do not have airing rights as follows in thousands on august   we entered into agreements with a subsidiary of cbs broadcasting  inc cbs and crown media united states  llc crown media to sublicense our rights to broadcast the television series touched by an angel touched to crown media for exclusive exhibition on the hallmark channel  commencing september  under the terms of the agreement with crown media  we will receive approximately million from crown media  million of which will be paid over a three year period commencing august and the remaining million of which will be paid over a three year period commencing august in addition  crown media is obligated to sub license future seasons from us should cbs renew the series 
under the terms of our agreement with cbs  we remain obligated to cbs for amounts due under our pre existing license agreement  less estimated programming cost savings of approximately million 
as of december   amounts due or committed to cbs totaled approximately million including commitments of approximately million for the season to be made available in the future 
the transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million  which is being deferred over the term of the crown media agreement 
we have a significant concentration of credit risk with respect to the amounts due from crown media under the sublicense agreement 
as of december   the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that we would sustain if crown media failed to perform under the agreement totaled approximately million  representing the present value of amounts due from crown media 
under the terms of the sublicense agreement  we have the right to terminate crown media s rights to broadcast touched if crown media fails to make timely payments under the agreement 
therefore  should crown media fail to perform under the agreement  we could regain our exclusive rights to broadcast touched on pax tv pursuant to our existing licensing agreement with cbs 
under our agreement with cbs  we are required to license future seasons of touched from cbs if the series is renewed by cbs 
under our sublicense agreement with crown media  crown media is obligated to sublicense such future seasons from us 
our financial obligation to cbs for future seasons will exceed the sublicense fees to be received from crown media  resulting in accrued programming losses to the extent the series is renewed in future seasons 
during the second quarter of  upon the decision by cbs to renew touched for the season  we became obligated to license the season  resulting in an accrued programming loss of approximately million 
this amount was offset in part by a decrease in our estimated loss on the season of approximately million  resulting in a net accrued programming loss of million in the second quarter 
the change in estimate for the season was due to the sublicensing agreement with crown media and a lower number of episodes produced than previously estimated

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the tables below provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitute forward looking statements 
all items described are non trading 
our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
we manage interest rate risks through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we use interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
interest rate swaps are entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
expected maturity dates for variable rate debt and interest rate swaps in the tables below are based upon contractual maturity dates 
average interest rates on variable rate debt and average variable rates under interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment 
the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable  and thus  approximate current market rates 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined from dealer quotations and represents the discounted future cash flows through maturity or expiration using current rates 
the fair value is effectively the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements
