for purposes of these acts  any statement that is not a statement of historical fact may be a forward looking statement 
for example  statements containing the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions may be forward looking statements 
however  we caution investors not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements in this report because these statements speak only as of the date when made 
furthermore  we are not obligated to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements  including without limitation the factors described below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
overview rsa security inc is a leading provider of electronic security  or e security  solutions 
with thousands of customers around the globe  we provide interoperable solutions for establishing online identities  access rights and privileges for people  applications and devices 
built to work seamlessly and transparently in the complex environments of our customers  our comprehensive portfolio of identity and access management solutions including authentication  web access management and developer solutions are designed to allow customers to confidently exploit new technologies for competitive advantage 
we sell our two factor user authentication  web access management and encryption products and solutions to corporate enterprise users seeking turnkey security solutions  and to original equipment manufacturers and developers seeking software development components for embedding security in a range of software applications or hardware devices 
we conduct our business in two segments e security solutions and rsa capital 
through our e security solutions segment  we derive our operating revenue primarily from two distinct product groups enterprise solutions  which includes rsa securid authenticators  rsa ace server software  rsa cleartrust software  rsa keon software  and maintenance and professional services for those products  and developer solutions  which includes rsa bsafe encryption software and protocol products  rsa keon components  and maintenance and professional services for those products 
sales of our rsa securid authenticator products continue to be strong  while our less mature enterprise software products continue to build revenue and market share 
over the last two years  we have seen a decrease in revenue from our developer solutions  which we believe is primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of technology companies funding development  as well as the availability of free  open source products that compete with our rsa bsafe product line  however  we have seen an emerging trend in developer solutions selling to enterprise customers 
our product line synergies create opportunities to sell additional products to existing customers 
typically  our enterprise solutions customers place an initial order for a limited number of users  for either our rsa securid authenticators or any of our software products 
as the use of our products grows within the enterprise  our customers may place additional orders with us to add more users 
as authenticators expire  typically three to four years after their initial purchase  our customers may order additional replacement authenticators 
in most cases  the customer will also enter into a customer support agreement with us at the time of initial purchase and renew this support agreement annually 
we typically base our rsa ace server  rsa keon and rsa cleartrust software license fees on the number of users authorized under each customer s license 
with respect to developer solutions  rsa bsafe software licensing terms vary by product and customer 
typical licensing terms may include an initial prepaid license fee and ongoing royalties paid as a percentage of the developer s product or service revenue  or payment of annual license fees  or a single fully paid up license fee 
often  our existing developer customers go on to license new software or technology from us or wish to increase the field of use rights for the technology they have already licensed 
in such a case  we amend our license agreement with the customer and charge additional licensing fees  thus deriving additional revenue 
we have contracted with outside manufacturing organizations to produce our rsa securid authenticators  and many of our products contain technology that is licensed from third parties 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture and delivery of rsa securid authenticators and royalty fees that we pay for the licensed technology 
cost of revenue also includes professional service  customer support  and production costs 
production costs include the programming labor  shipping  inspection and quality control functions associated with the rsa securid authenticators 
we are currently working to establish new vendor relationships in order to increase the number of suppliers from which we buy our authenticators and authenticator components  in order to reduce our vulnerability to potential supply problems 

table of contents our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are denominated in us dollars and local currency  with the majority of our sales denominated in us dollars 
our sales through indirect distribution channels are generally denominated in us dollars 
for countries outside the united states  we generally pay our operating expenses in local currency 
where we do invoice customers in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time of invoice until collection occurs 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations between the time we collect in us dollars and the time we pay our operating expenses in local currency 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets 
our rsa capital segment consists of our investment activities  and was formed to make synergistic investments in both external and internal activities and technologies 
through our investment activities  we have historically made investments primarily in equity instruments of e businesses and other technology companies 
during we reduced our commitment of resources to the rsa capital segment and recorded impairment charges on our equity investments to reduce their carrying value to their estimated realizable value  less costs to dispose 
we are currently considering proposals to sell our investment portfolio  and we currently do not intend to make any new investments 
during  we intend to focus our resources on our e security solutions segment 
expenses incurred in connection with our investment activities are primarily for general and administration and management and professional fees 
also included in our rsa capital segment is our interest in crosby finance  llc  a qualified special purpose entity  with a carrying value of million at december  information on our investment in crosby finance  llc may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our rsa capital segment also included our new emerging security technologies group  or nest  which was merged into our e security solutions segment prior to the second quarter of through nest we focused on investigating  developing and nurturing new ideas and technologies into operational businesses 
expenses incurred in connection with nest activities included general and administration expenses  as well as the operations of g international  inc and transindigo inc transindigo 
information on our segments may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructurings  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from two sources sales of products  including hardware and software licenses  and services  including maintenance  support and professional services 
our management must make and use judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period may materially differ if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates in establishing our allowance for sales returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  as amended and interpreted 
we recognize revenue from the sale of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenue is reduced by provisions for estimated sales returns 
for all sales  we use a binding contract  purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
sales to our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we consider delivery to occur when we ship the product  so long as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

table of contents at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable and whether collection is probable 
if we determine the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the fee is determined and payment becomes due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we do not record revenue until such time when collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
in our arrangements with our customers  we generally do not include acceptance provisions  which would give the customer the right to accept or reject the product after we ship it 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we recognize revenue upon shipment of product to stocking distributors for sales to distributors who have only limited return rights  and record a sales return reserve to provide for estimated product returns 
when arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using the residual method 
our determination of fair value of each of the undelivered elements in multi element arrangements is based on vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value for each element is either the price we charge when the same element is sold separately or the price established by the members of our management  who have the relevant authority to set prices  for an element not yet sold separately 
for arrangements containing multiple elements where vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until vsoe of fair value exists or all elements have been delivered 
maintenance service revenue  whether sold separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  generally twelve months 
revenue allocated to professional service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for sales returns we record allowances for estimated sales returns and allowances on products and maintenance and professional service related revenue in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  current economic trends  product line and customer industry and other known factors 
our historical experience with sales returns varies by product line depending on the customer s industries and markets 
we must make judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the allowances for estimated sales returns in any reporting period 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any reporting period may materially differ if actual sales returns and allowances differ from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in our customer payment terms  and other known factors when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
recoveries of accounts previously written off as uncollectible are recorded as increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves our estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of acquisition related net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and earnings and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
we will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is determined generally based on estimated discounted future cash flows or a market multiple valuation method 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined the fair value of our intangible assets was zero and accordingly  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our intangible assets  other than goodwill  to their fair value 
at december   we had approximately million of goodwill which accounted for approximately of our total assets 
any goodwill impairment test could result in a decrease to the carrying value of goodwill and could have a material effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position 
the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to analyze the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis 
we perform this annual test for impairment as of november of each year and  if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount  will perform an interim impairment test 
the test for impairment is performed under a two step process 
the first step tests for impairment  and the second step if necessary measures impairment 
goodwill is included in our e security solutions segment  which contains one reporting unit reporting unit 
we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of november   by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined based upon independent appraisal using the market multiple valuation method 
as of november  the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
therefore  the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of november  did not result in an impairment 
long term investments our long term investments include investments in preferred and common stock of privately held companies and our interest in crosby finance  llc  a qualified special purpose entity 
at december   we had approximately million of long term investments which included million for investments in preferred and common stock of privately held companies and million for our interest in crosby 
we carry our investments in privately held companies at their estimated realizable value less costs to dispose 
we regularly consider available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our privately held investments 
because no public market exists for these investments  we estimate their value based on potential financing valuations and the investees forecasted financial performance  as well as the external markets for these types of investments 
if the assumptions and estimates used in assessing the value of these investments are not accurate  or adverse changes in market conditions occur  or forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges that we have not previously recognized 
during  we recognized impairment charges of million related to our long term investments in privately held companies 
during the fourth quarter of we initiated a process to sell our equity investments  and recorded an impairment charge of million to reflect the investments at their estimated realizable value  less costs of disposal 
during  three of the companies in which we had invested were in the process of obtaining additional financing or being sold  and based upon valuations and anticipated cash proceeds  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying amount of these investments to their estimated fair value 
we account for our investment in crosby under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structured notes 
we are carrying our interest in crosby at fair value with all increases and decreases in fair value reported in income from investing activities in the statement of operations 
we determine the fair value based on the fair value of crosby s right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds upon maturity of the vdf contract 
at december   our interest in crosby had a fair value of million  and is included in investments as a long term asset 
should the fair value of our investment in crosby decrease  we would incur a pretax charge of up to million  which would be included in income from investing activities in our consolidated statements of operations 
restructurings during  and  we initiated consolidation of certain operations in order to enhance operational efficiency and reduce expenses  and recorded significant restructuring charges in connection with these actions 
restructuring charges were million and million for and  respectively 
these restructuring charges require us to make estimates based upon real estate market conditions  rental rates  future corporate requirements  general economic conditions and future estimated cash flows 
included in the restructuring charges recorded in are facility exit costs of million  which represents estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to lease payments due through under certain exited facilities lease agreements  impaired leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures  and other associated facilities expenses 
estimates related to the length of time to reserve excess facilities are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable subtenants and are based on market trend information analysis 
estimates of sublease income are based upon the terms of existing sublease agreements that we have obtained and market trend information analysis 
if the assumptions for these estimates change due to changes in the real estate and sublease markets  or due to the terms of sublease agreements that we have obtained  the ultimate restructuring 
table of contents expenses for these facilities could vary by material amounts  and could cause us to record additional restructuring charges in future reporting periods 
included in the restructuring charges are facility exit costs of million  which arose when we revised the estimates that we had used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
these estimates were revised due to higher than anticipated operating costs and changes to estimated length of time we expect it will take to obtain subtenants for certain excess facilities

goodwill is included in our e security solutions segment  which contains one reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test compared the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we determined the estimated fair value of the reporting unit based upon an independent appraisal using the market multiple valuation method 
as of the january  transitional goodwill impairment test  the fair value of our reporting unit was greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
therefore  the transitional goodwill impairment test performed as of january  did not result in an impairment of our goodwill

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to our technology  customer list  trademark and noncompetition agreement intangible assets due to circumstances that indicated the carrying value of these intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we determined that the carrying amount of these assets was not recoverable because the carrying value of these assets exceeded the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of these assets 
we determined the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their fair value at december  we determined the fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of these assets 
the fair value of the intangible assets was determined to be zero at december   and accordingly  we recorded a million impairment charge for the year ended december  to reduce the carrying amount of our intangible assets to their fair value

the following tables set forth the amount  percentage of total revenue and percentage decrease of revenue by regional area years ended december  percentage in millions revenue percentage revenue percentage decrease united states europe and other asia pacific total we believe the decrease in total revenue in as compared to was primarily due to the continued decline in information technology spending by our existing and prospective customers due to the uncertainty of the economy 
we believe that when and if information technology spending increases from the current rates of spending we will benefit with increased revenue 
we believe our product revenue will increase if businesses continue the trend toward permitting remote access to internal resources and web enabling existing applications 
we also believe our identity and access management solutions promote our product synergies and will enable us to generate additional revenue by selling additional products to existing customers 
we believe revenue from sales of rsa securid authenticators declined in as compared to primarily due to the recent and continued downsizing of businesses 
the number of rsa securid authenticator units sold decreased in to million from million in in addition  the average selling price per authenticator unit decreased in to from in the decrease in number of units sold  along with the decrease in the average selling price in as compared to  contributed to the decreased revenue from our rsa securid authentication product line 
the decrease in the average selling price can be attributed to an increase in the number of larger volume transactions during as compared to  because we tend to give larger discounts on larger volume transactions 
we believe our rsa securid authentication products generate and will continue to generate substantial revenue for us 

table of contents our authentication products revenue includes revenue from our rsa keon product line for all periods presented 
rsa keon revenue decreased in as compared to the same period of  which we believe was due primarily to our customers delaying or canceling the implementation of large infrastructure information technology projects 
in addition  during we eliminated several products included in the rsa keon product line  and this contributed to the decrease in revenue from our rsa keon product line 
however  due to synergies within our product lines  rsa keon product line has generated and  we expect  will continue to generate strong revenue 
we believe that the revenue generated from our authenticator product division will continue to provide steady overall growth for us despite the weakened global economy 
as result of the acquisition of securant in september  we established the rsa cleartrust web access management solution product division  and generated million of web access management revenue in the fourth quarter of web access management revenue was million and accounted for of total revenue for we believe  despite a highly competitive market  that our web access management revenue will contribute approximately to of our total revenue during we believe that the decrease in developer solutions and encryption revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of technology companies funding development and in the development of new information technology products  as well as the availability of free  open source products that compete with our rsa bsafe product line 
we believe revenue from sales of encryption products to enterprise customers has contributed  and will continue to contribute  to our developer solutions revenue  and we therefore expect that our encryption revenue will continue to account for approximately of our total revenue in we believe the increase in service revenue in as compared to can primarily be attributed to continued purchases by new customers coupled with renewals of annual maintenance contracts from sale of products in prior periods 
we believe that as the united states government proceeds with its agenda of increasing awareness of cyber security issues  and its focus on homeland security  we will benefit with increased revenue 
we believe the government sector of our business may increase in the future as government agencies seek e security partners in order to execute their cyber security agenda 
in addition  we believe the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa privacy and security standards that require security for online healthcare transactions and clinical trials has increased our revenue from the healthcare and pharmaceutical vertical market segment 
gross profit the following tables set forth the gross profit and gross margin for products and maintenance and professional services years ended december  in millions gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin products maintenance and professional services total included in the gross profit for products for is a million charge for inventory write down related to discontinued product designs and for product quality warranty accruals 
included in the gross profit for products for is a write off of prepaid royalties of million 
these prepaid royalties were expensed to cost of product revenue when it was determined that they may not have future realizable value as a result of our acquisition of xcert international  inc xcert in february excluding the inventory write down and warranty accruals  gross margin for products was for excluding the prepaid royalties  total gross margin for products was for we have included these gross margin measures  which are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  for year over year comparison purposes 
we believe the decrease in gross margin for products for as compared to  after excluding the items mentioned above  can be primarily attributed to the decrease in our software revenue 
our software products have higher gross margins than our other product types  and a decrease in software revenue would cause our gross margin for products to decrease 
we believe the increase in gross profit from maintenance and professional services in as compared to was primarily attributable to increased maintenance revenue achieved on decreased customer support costs 
customer support costs decreased due to cost reduction programs implemented since the third quarter of we expect to maintain total gross margins of between and for 
table of contents research and development total research and development expenses decreased in to million from million in  and represented of total revenue for for as compared to  approximately million of the decrease in research and development expenses was from decreased payroll  overheard and consulting expenses associated with our reduced workforce

for as compared to  approximately million of the decrease in marketing and selling expenses was from decreased payroll expenses and overhead costs associated with our reduced workforce  approximately million of the decrease was from decreased spending on marketing programs  approximately million of the decrease was from a reduction in bad debt expense  and approximately million of the decrease was from decreased commission expense due to decreased revenue 
rsa capital expenses included in total marketing and selling expenses were million for  all of which were attributable to our nest group  which merged into our e security solutions segment prior to the second quarter of we believe marketing and selling expenditures will be to of total revenue in general and administrative total general and administrative expenses decreased in to million from million in  and represented of total revenue for the decrease in total general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to cost reduction measures

costs related to these acquisitions are for investment banking  professional fees and other direct costs  including employee severance and facilities closure 
these costs were recorded on the dates of acquisition and have been included in the allocation of the purchase prices 
in september  we acquired all of the capital stock of securant  a privately held company that developed the cleartrust web access management solution  for an aggregate of million in cash including acquisition costs 
in may  we acquired all of the capital stock of gi  a privately held company that developed smart card and biometric authentication products  and substantially all of the assets of transindigo  a privately held company that developed real time web access management software products  for an aggregate of million in cash including acquisition costs and litigation expenses 
in february  we acquired all of the capital stock of xcert  a privately held company that developed digital certificate based products for securing e business transactions  for million in cash  including acquisition costs  plus the assumption of all xcert stock options 

table of contents allocation of the purchase prices for all four acquisitions completed during were based on estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on independent appraisals 
these allocations were as follows estimated fair values gi and estimated in millions securant xcert transindigo total life assets and liabilities  including cash goodwill intangible assets to years deferred tax liabilities  net in process research and development total purchase price less assumption of stock options less cash acquired net cash paid effective january   the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  required that the amortization of goodwill arising from business acquisitions be discontinued  and instead be evaluated at least annually for impairment 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during to reduce the carrying value of these intangible assets to zero at december  accordingly  we will not record any amortization expense related to these intangible assets after december  as a result of this impairment charge  we reduced the deferred tax liabilities associated with the intangible assets to zero at december  as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  we reclassified in place workforce related intangible assets into goodwill  resulting in an increase to goodwill and a decrease to intangible assets of million 
in addition  upon reclassification of in place workforce related intangible assets to goodwill and determination of indefinite lived assets  we reversed the deferred tax liabilities related to these intangible assets 
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities resulted in a decrease to goodwill and deferred tax liabilities of million 
the allocation of the securant purchase price has been revised since september  the date of acquisition for unrecorded liabilities related to pre acquisition contingencies and uncollectible accounts receivable  which resulted in a net decrease to the allocation of assets and liabilities and an increase to goodwill of million 
we received million from the securant escrow fund during in settlement of several claims 
we expect to record additional adjustments to the securant purchase price upon finalization of the post closing adjustment and settlement of any escrow claims 
in june  we paid million to xcert stockholders upon finalization of the working capital calculation 
the cost of the working capital adjustment has been added to the purchase price of xcert and resulted in an increase to goodwill of million 
we incurred litigation expenses in connection with patent litigation relating to the products acquired in our may acquisition of gi and recorded these expenses as related costs of acquisition 
the costs to defend the gi lawsuit are covered by the escrow fund set aside from the gi purchase price 
we have submitted claims against the gi escrow totaling approximately million 
through december  we have received an aggregate of million from the gi escrow to cover these litigation costs and other claims 
the selling stockholders are disputing the remaining claims 
the costs of litigation and disbursements from the gi escrow resulted in a net increase to goodwill of approximately million 
we used an independent appraiser to calculate the amounts allocated to assets and liabilities acquired including intangible assets and in process research and development ipr d 
the independent appraiser used established valuation techniques accepted in the high technology industry  including the income method  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value  and the cost method  which uses replacement costs 
these methods give consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  product sales cycles  and the estimated lives of each of the product s underlying technology 
for ipr d  consideration was also given to the projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development and the projected cost to complete the project 
the amounts allocated to ipr d projects were expensed in the quarter that the related acquisition was consummated because technological feasibility of the ipr d projects had not been achieved and there were no alternative future uses 
ipr d expense of million for the year ended december  represents the write off of ipr d in connection with the acquisition of securant  xcert  gi and transindigo 

table of contents the estimated costs to complete the ipr d projects are for payroll and related overhead costs for engineers employed in the completion of these development projects 
we would revise the estimate of remaining costs to be incurred should the projects fail to meet technological feasibility 
the valuation of the ipr d was determined using the income method 
revenue and expense projections as well as technology assumptions were prepared for to years based on information provided by the acquired companies management 
revenue projections for each ipr d project were identified as revenue derived from products relying on current technology  if any  and revenue derived from projects relying on a new ipr d project 
expense projections including cost of products sold and operating expenses varied depending on the ipr d project 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle  and resulting in discount rates in a range of  depending on the ipr d project 
the fair value of the ipr d was determined separately from all other acquired assets using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion ratios were estimated based on the estimated man hours remaining to complete each project versus total man hours estimated for each project to achieve technological feasibility 
management is responsible for estimates of the fair value of the ipr d 
the following table summarizes the nature  percentage complete  timing and estimated cost to complete for each ipr d project as of december  estimated cost to release date or complete at description of project complete expected release date december  xcert other in process research and development projects various various million transindigo elara third quarter of million given the risks associated with the uncertainties of the commercialization process  such as rapidly changing customer needs  complexity of technology and growing competitive pressures  we cannot assure investors that deviations from our estimates will not occur or that the projects will meet with commercial success 
we believe there is a reasonable chance of realizing the economic return expected from the acquired ipr d 
restructurings during and  we evaluated and initiated restructuring actions in order to consolidate some of our operations  enhance operational efficiency and reduce expenses 
we continue to monitor and assess our facility obligations  real estate markets and our operating expenses 
as a result of these ongoing assessments  we have recorded additional restructuring charges or revised previously recorded restructuring charges 
these actions resulted in total restructuring charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

total facility exit costs for include costs of million we incurred when we revised estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
we revised the estimates included in facility exit costs due to the extension of the period of time estimated to obtain sublease tenants for certain exited facilities  based on the terms of finalized subleases obtained during  due to higher than anticipated operating costs associated with certain exited facilities  and due to the continued uncertainty and deterioration in the commercial real estate and sublet markets in the boston metropolitan area 
we recorded restructuring charges of million during associated with the liquidation of our swedish development operations and the sale of certain swedish assets and the business related to the assets to tfs

during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a process to sell our equity investments  and recorded an impairment charge of million to reflect the investments at their estimated realizable value  less costs of disposal 
during  three of the companies in which we had invested were in the process of obtaining additional financing or being sold  and based upon valuations and anticipated cash proceeds  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying amount of these investments to their estimated fair value 
in november  we transferred approximately million shares of verisign common stock  which were covered by three forwards and one vdf  to crosby finance  llc  of which we are a member 
crosby is a bankruptcy remote qualified special purpose entity  established specifically to securitize the shares of verisign common stock 
the contribution and the transfer have been accounted for as a sale under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  we do not consolidate crosby for accounting purposes 
the counterparty to the vdf contract holds the remaining interest in crosby 
during  the three forwards matured and crosby received total cash proceeds of million upon delivery of million shares of verisign common stock to the counterparty 
crosby distributed the proceeds from the forwards to us and the counterparty at our respective membership interest percentages 
this generated cash proceeds of million and resulted in a gain of million to us  which is included in income from investing activities for at december   crosby held approximately million shares of verisign common stock and the vdf contract 
the vdf contract entitles crosby to receive cash proceeds of up to million depending on the market price of verisign common stock on january  the closing price of verisign s common stock on the nasdaq national market on december  was per share 
unless the value of verisign common stock appreciates to at least per share in january  crosby will not be entitled to any cash proceeds 
crosby has no liability or obligation to its members or the counterparty to the vdf contract other than to deliver the shares of verisign common stock to the counterparty upon maturity of the vdf contract and to distribute the cash proceeds  if any  to its members 
after settlement of the vdf in january  crosby will dissolve 
the carrying amount of our interest in crosby was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we account for our investment in crosby under the guidelines of eitf no 
 recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structured notes 
before the settlement of the forwards  we used the retrospective interest method to account for our interest in crosby as we believed we would recover a substantial amount of our interest 
any increases in the cost basis of our 
table of contents interest in crosby  determined by applying the retrospective interest method  were recorded in interest income 
any changes in the fair value of our interest in crosby were recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
in the fourth quarter of  after the settlement of the last forward  it became reasonably possible that we could lose all or substantially all of the value of our remaining interest  and therefore could no longer apply the retrospective interest method to our interest in crosby 
accordingly  we are carrying our interest at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in income from investing activities 
we determine the fair value of our interest in crosby based on the fair value of crosby s right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds upon maturity of the vdf 
the decline in the fair value of our interest in crosby was million for the year ended december  benefit provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for compared to a provision of million for the income tax benefit recorded during is due to lower pre tax income in as compared to  the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill for financial statement purposes upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and other non deductible acquisition related costs incurred in we believe the income tax benefit will be recoverable through a carry back claim to previously filed tax returns

in september we acquired securant technologies  inc a privately held company that developed and delivered the cleartrust web access management solutions 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the securant acquisition  we established the rsa cleartrust web access management solution as our fourth product line  which generated revenue of million for our stocking distributor program began in we sell all of our product lines to stocking distributors  with authentication products comprising most sales 
our stocking distributors purchase our products  take title upon shipment and resell the products to their customers 
stocking distributors have contractual rights of return for stock rotation purposes of generally to of their purchase volume 
prior to january   we believed we lacked sufficient data to reasonably estimate returns from stocking distributors and therefore we recognized revenue upon evidence of a sale to the end user 
by the beginning of  we had sufficient data to reasonably estimate stocking distributor returns and we determined that historically  actual return volumes have averaged less than of stocking distributor purchase volume 
based on this experience and the criteria set out in sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we began recognizing revenue upon shipment of product to the stocking distributors  net of estimated returns 
our revenue recognized from sales to stocking distributors in increased by million due to this change in estimate 
the increase in recognized revenue of million resulted in a decrease to net loss of million and a decrease to diluted loss per share of for the year ended december  we believe that our revenue grew at a slower rate in than it has done historically  not because of competitive pressures  but instead due to the general weakening of the global economy 
we believe that the general weakening of the global economy and the hesitant economic climate after the september th terrorist attacks resulted in decreases in spending by corporate information technology departments and by software developers 
we also believe developer spending decreased substantially with the fall off in venture investing after the collapse of many dot 
com companies 
we believe the increase in service revenue can primarily be attributed to increased maintenance revenue due to an increase in the number of installed users over the past several years 
the number of rsa securid authenticator units sold increased in to million from million in the average selling price per authenticator unit decreased in to from in the increase in number of units sold combined with the decrease in the average selling price per unit contributed to the increase in rsa securid authentication product line revenue of in to million from million in we believe that the decrease in developer revenue can be attributed to the weakened global economy  a decrease in new software development companies and the availability of free  open source products that compete with our rsa bsafe product line 
our strong revenue growth in international markets combined with a decrease in united states revenue contributed to the increase in international revenue as percentage of total revenue for we believe that a portion of our increase in international revenue is due to our growing penetration of international markets

between october  and september  we settled four collar contracts by delivering million shares of verisign common stock and realized gains of million and million in and  respectively 
on november  we exercised our right to terminate the collars on the remaining million shares of verisign common stock 
we delivered shares of verisign common stock to terminate the collars  which resulted in no cash proceeds to us and the recognition of a net gain of million during after termination of the collars  we had million shares of verisign common stock remaining 
in order to create current liquidity  on november  we entered into three forwards with respect to million shares of verisign common stock and a vdf contract with respect to million shares of verisign common stock

we can redeem all or a portion of the convertible debentures for cash at any time after october   as long as the arithmetic average of the weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day during the fifteen trading day period immediately prior to the election to redeem is of the conversion price 
this conversion feature was not exercisable at december  the debentures are unsecured and are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
the agreements governing the convertible debentures contain covenants restricting our ability to incur and guarantee additional debt 
the covenants limit the amount of additional debt we may incur to the lesser of of our consolidated stockholders equity  which was approximately million at december   or a total of million including the balance of the convertible debentures outstanding 
we have a million line of credit agreement with a major financial institution against which we may elect to borrow at any time until june   subject to annual extension provisions 
borrowing availability is reduced by letters of credit issued for purposes such as collateralizing real estate rental agreements 
at december   we had million of borrowing availability under this line of credit 
borrowings under this agreement will bear interest at either fixed or variable rates linked to either the london interbank offered rate or the prime rate 
borrowings will be collateralized by our cash deposits 
in july  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
this registration statement  which the sec declared effective in august  covers our issuance of various types of securities  including debt  common stock and warrants  up to an aggregate offering price of million 
as of december   there have been no issuance of securities under this shelf registration statement 
we currently have no plans to issue any securities under this shelf registration statement 
any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and accounts receivable days outstanding calculated as net accounts receivable divided by revenue per day will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and accounts receivable days outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as the amount of international sales and length of customer s payment cycle 
we also record deferred maintenance billings as accounts receivable  and the timing of these billings affects the accounts receivable days outstanding 
historically  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers 
an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our accounts receivable days outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
due to the current economic climate  we may observe an increase in the length of our customers payment cycle 
to address increases in accounts receivable balance and to improve cash flow  we may from time to time take actions to encourage earlier payment of receivables 
discounts offered to customers to encourage payment are deducted from revenue 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we may incur increased bad debt expense and increased estimates for reserves against revenue and will be subject to greater general credit risks 
worldcom  inc has been one of our significant resellers  but represented less than of our revenue in any period presented 
we do not believe worldcom s bankruptcy filing will have a material impact on our financial position 
during the first quarter of we sold one of our equity investments in a privately held company for approximately million 
in addition  we received approximately million from the liquidation of another of our equity investments 
we expect to receive a tax refund of approximately million by the end of this tax refund is attributable to the recovery of income taxes paid in prior years and is available to us due to the carryback of operating losses incurred in and this refund is subject to the timing of the filing of our tax returns and any internal revenue service review 

table of contents crosby held approximately million shares of verisign common stock and a variable delivery forward contract  or vdf  at december  the gain recorded for financial reporting purposes upon execution of the vdf contract in has not been recognized for tax purposes  and accordingly we recorded a million deferred tax liability in this deferred tax liability will reverse upon maturity of the vdf contract in and the gain will be included in the calculation of our taxable income for the recognition of that gain would result in a tax liability to us and may require the payment of cash to settle such tax liability 
our subscription to invest in rsa ventures  our venture capital fund  is million 
we had invested million at december  in rsa ventures 
over the ten year life of rsa ventures  we may invest  at our sole discretion  up to an additional million 
we currently do not intend to invest this amount 
our plans for future uses of cash may include additional acquisitions of other entities or technologies  retirement of outstanding debt and additional purchases of property and equipment 
we anticipate capital expenditures for will be primarily for purchases of property and equipment and will aggregate up to approximately million 
due to realignment of our manufacturing operations and the implementation of new hardware designs for our rsa securid authenticators  our inventory levels dropped at december  we typically maintain a three to four months supply of inventory on hand  and we intend to use cash during the first half of to re establish our inventories to these levels 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures and increase in inventory supply from cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we believe that cash generated from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  because of our concern that the current economic conditions may persist during  if not longer  we have taken and continue to take steps to reduce our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenue 
we anticipate that current cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and cash generated from the exercise of employee options and employee stock purchase plans will be adequate to fund our planned capital and financing expenditures for at least the next twelve months

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results our operating results tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  can cause these fluctuations  including  among others the size  timing and shipment of individual orders for our products  changes in our operating expenses  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of our products and our competitors products  customers deferring their orders in anticipation of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products  changes in the mix of products sold  changes in product pricing  including changes in competitors pricing policies  development and performance of our direct and indirect distribution channels  the amount and timing of charges relating to the impairment or loss of value of some of our assets  especially goodwill  intangible assets and investments  the timing of personnel departures and new hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  and general economic conditions 
we may not be able to achieve  sustain or grow our profitability from quarter to quarter 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  a small variation in when revenue is recognized can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
our business has historically tended to be seasonal  with the last quarter of the year having the highest amount of revenue and the first quarter of the year having the lowest amount of revenue 
if we cannot sublease our excess facilities  then we will have to continue to make lease payments for these facilities until the leases expire 
we currently lease a number of excess  unused or under used facilities that we are trying to sublet  and some of our lease commitments for these facilities will not expire for several years 
the real estate market  especially the real estate market in the boston metropolitan area where our headquarters are located  has deteriorated significantly during the last months  and we do not know when or whether we will be able to find sublessees for our excess facilities 
if the global economy remains weak  then we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
the global economy  especially the technology sector  is still weak and may continue to be in recession for the foreseeable future 
the general economic slowdown has had and may continue to have serious negative consequences for our business and operating results 
we believe that the economic slowdown is causing some current or potential customers to defer purchases  to go out of business or to have insufficient capital to buy or pay for our products 
in response to the current economic conditions  many companies have reduced their budgets for information technology products and services  which could reduce or eliminate some potential sales of our products and services 
in addition  some of our resellers and distributors are experiencing financial difficulties due to the weak economy  which affects our ability to sell to and collect money from those resellers and distributors 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
from january  through february   our stock price has ranged from a per share high of to a low of 
a number of factors may contribute to the volatility of our stock price  including our ability to meet the expectations of brokerage firms  industry analysts and investors with respect to our operating and financial results  the securities and exchange commission investigation into our disclosure in the first quarter of of a change in our method of estimating distributor revenue and trading in our common stock for more information about the investigation see part i  item legal proceedings of this report  our public announcements and our competitors public announcements  the public s perception of the strength of the e security solutions market and technology companies generally  litigation developments  the volatility of the stock market in general and of the technology sector in particular  and general economic conditions 
if the market for e security solutions does not continue to grow  then demand for our products may decrease 
the market for some of our e security solutions is continuing to develop  and demand for our products depends on  among other things the perceived ability of our products to address real customer problems  
table of contents the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  market acceptance and use of digital signatures and digital certificates in business applications  the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the public s perception of the need for secure electronic commerce and communications over both wired and wireless computer networks  the perceived quality  price  availability and interoperability of our products as compared to our competitors products  the pace of technological change and our ability to keep up with these changes  and general economic conditions  which  among other things  influence how much money our customers and potential customers are willing to allocate to their information technology budgets 
if we fail to keep up with changes in e security technology and standards  then our products could become obsolete 
the market for e security products is rapidly evolving 
e security technology is constantly changing as we and our competitors introduce new products and retire old ones and as customer requirements develop and change 
in addition  the industry and government standards for e commerce and network security continue to evolve 
if any market segments for our products adopt technologies or standards that are inconsistent with our products and technology  sales of our products in those market segments could decline 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce new  competitively priced products and solutions with features that meet changing customer requirements  all in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may not be successful in introducing new or enhanced products 
a number of factors  including the following  could have a negative impact on the success of our products quality  reliability or security failures  which could result in product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  unexpected service or warranty expenses  reduced orders and a decline in our competitive position  undetected software errors or bugs in the final products shipped to our customers  which could cause market acceptance of our products to be lost or delayed  delays or difficulties in product development  our competitors introduction of new products ahead of our new products  or their introduction of superior or cheaper products  the availability of free  unpatented implementations of encryption algorithms and security protocols  the market s failure to accept new technologies  including web access management  digital certificate and public and private key management technologies  our failure to include features in our products  or obtain industry and governmental certifications  that our customers or us or foreign government regulators may require  our failure to anticipate changes in customers requirements  and the implementation of standards that are inconsistent with the technology embodied in our products 
we may need to purchase or license technology from third parties in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 
we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology we need and  if we find such businesses  may not be able to purchase or license the technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
some of our products have long and unpredictable sales cycles 
transactions for some of our products  especially our digital certificate management and web access management products  often involve large expenditures by our customers 
some of our customers may also need to invest substantial resources and modify their computer network infrastructures to take advantage of our products 
therefore  the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable  and the long nature of the sales cycles may impact our quarterly operating results 
the sales cycles for these transactions are subject to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the need to educate potential customers about our products capabilities  customers willingness to make changes in their network infrastructures to take advantage of our products  the timing of customers budget cycles  and delays caused by customers internal review processes 
in addition  we are currently working on increasing our sales to the united states federal government 
federal regulatory  approval and purchasing requirements can greatly lengthen the sales cycle for sales to the federal government 
if we fail to remain competitive  then we could lose market share 
some of our competitors offer e security products with features and functionality that our products do not currently offer 
in addition  some computer and software companies that have not traditionally offered e security products are now offering free or low cost e security products and functionality bundled with their own computer and software products 
either of these competitive factors may cause us to lose potential sales or sell our products at lower prices 

table of contents furthermore  some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to leverage an installed customer base  adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
we believe that we need to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing in order to maintain our competitive position 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments and may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive position 
in addition  the expiration of some of our patents has permitted the use and distribution of freeware  free versions of some of our technology 
we believe that some potential customers may be choosing to use freeware instead of buying our products 
furthermore  many companies have reduced their information technology budgets due to the current economic conditions  which could make competition more intense because we are competing for fewer customer dollars 
both of these factors could result in lower prices for our products  reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance 
international sales make up a significant portion of our business 
international sales accounted for more than of our total revenue in each of the years ended december   and we may need to tailor or localize our products in order to compete in particular international markets and to comply with foreign laws 
we may not be able to develop  market and distribute localized versions of our products in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  including foreign regulatory requirements and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  legal uncertainty regarding liability and the costs of resolving or litigating a dispute internationally  difficulties in the enforcement of intellectual property rights  export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products incorporating that technology  difficulties and delays in establishing international distribution channels  difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  tariffs and other trade barriers  and political instability 
if we fail to obtain a sufficient supply of high quality rsa securid authenticators or components  then we may be unable to fill customer orders or may need to replace defective authenticators shipped to our customers 
we have experienced some problems  and may experience problems in the future  relating to the quality and reliability of some of our authenticators and authenticator components 
for example  during we encountered some quality control problems with some of the batteries contained in our authenticators and also had to replace some defective tokens 
problems with the availability or quality of our products could cause our revenue to decrease and our costs to increase  damage our reputation in the marketplace and subject us to damage claims from our customers 
we must establish and maintain strategic relationships 
we need to create relationships with third parties  including some of our competitors  to ensure that our products will interoperate with the third parties products 
if our products do not work with third party products used by our customers and potential customers  then our products could lose or fail to achieve market acceptance 
in addition  one of our business strategies is to enter into strategic marketing alliances or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer population than we could reach alone through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
if we cannot create relationships with strategic partners  then we will need to devote more resources to sales and marketing 
we may not be able to find appropriate strategic partners or may not be able to enter into relationships on commercially favorable terms 
furthermore  the relationships we do enter into may not be successful 
because our strategic relationships are generally non exclusive  our strategic partners may decide to pursue alternative technologies or to develop alternative products in addition to or instead of our products  either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors 

table of contents if we fail to protect our rights in our proprietary technology  competitors may use our technology  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  software licenses  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we also generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  distributors and strategic partners as well as with our customers and potential customers seeking proprietary information  and limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized third parties may nonetheless succeed at copying aspects of our products  obtaining and using information that we regard as proprietary  or infringing upon our patents and other proprietary rights 
we rely on patents to protect our proprietary rights in our technology  but patents may not provide complete protection it is possible that any patent that we or our licensors hold might be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or terminated 
it is possible that patent examiners might reject the claims described in our pending or future patent applications 
the laws of some countries in which our products are now  or may in the future be  developed or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
during the life of a patent  third parties may design and sell work around solutions that accomplish the goals of our patented inventions but do not infringe the patents themselves 
our issued us patents expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent  which could result in lower prices  reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance 
in addition  when each of our patents expires  potential customers may choose to rely on freeware  free versions of our previously patented technology  rather than buying our products 
we have registered  or are seeking to register  our trademarks and service marks in most countries where we sell our products 
however  from time to time third parties oppose our pending trademark and service mark applications 
furthermore  some national trademark offices may not permit us to register the marks on terms that we find acceptable 
we will seek to enforce our trademark and service mark rights against third parties who are marketing goods or services under marks that we consider confusingly similar to our marks 
however  there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any enforcement action 
we may also seek to purchase or license trademarks from third parties  but we may not be able to purchase or license trademarks on commercially favorable terms or at all 
the technology industry is highly litigious 
from time to time  we have been involved in disputes with third parties who allege that our products may infringe intellectual property rights held by the third parties 
for example  we recently completed a trial in the patent infringement case that leon stambler brought against us for more information about the litigation see part i  item legal proceedings of this report 
any litigation carries a number of significant risks  including litigation is often very expensive  even if it is resolved in our favor  and litigation diverts the attention of management and other resources 
moreover  if a court or other government agency rules against us in any intellectual property litigation  we might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses to the infringing technology  or pay significant monetary damages 
security technologies are under constant attack 
the strength of our cryptographic and other e security technologies is constantly being tested by computer professionals  academics and hackers 
any significant advance in the techniques for attacking e security solutions could make some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable 
from time to time  we have learned of attempts by third parties to reverse engineer our products to find vulnerabilities 
if a third party successfully hacks any of our products and makes its findings public  then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the published vulnerabilities 
for example  if a third party were to hack our rsa securid solution  then some of our customers could require that we replace some or all of their rsa securid authenticators with authenticators that are more secure 
if we are required to make these replacements or if we cannot 
table of contents address the vulnerabilities in our products in a timely fashion  then our business and operating results could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our customers and potential customers could perceive our products as unreliable  making it more difficult for us to sell our products 
we may incur significant expenses and damages because of liability claims 
an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at our facilities or at a customer s facilities could result in a product liability claim against us 
a substantial product liability claim against us could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any actual or perceived breach of network or data security  whether or not caused by the failure of one of our products  could hurt our reputation and cause potential customers to turn to our competitors products 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our product components 
although we generally use standard parts and components for our products  some components are currently available only from limited sources 
for example  sanyo electric co  ltd 
and epson electronics are our only suppliers for the microprocessor chips contained in our rsa securid products  and flextronics and calcomp are our only manufacturers of rsa securid authenticators 
if our suppliers were unable to provide us with a sufficient supply of these or any other components and or rsa securid authenticators  then we may be unable to fill customer orders and would have to expend significant resources to find new suppliers and or manufacturers 
even if we were able to find new suppliers  these suppliers may not be able to produce the components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
acts of terrorism or war may hurt economic conditions in the united states and abroad  which could harm our business 
our business is affected by forces  pressures and events affecting global economic conditions 
after the september  terrorist attacks in new york city and washington  dc  we experienced delays in closing business transactions 
we believe these delays resulted  at least in part  from the september attacks 
in addition  although we can manufacture and ship our products from two locations bedford  massachusetts  usa and shannon  ireland if we were to lose the ability to operate one of these facilities  we may not be able to manufacture and ship at adequate levels to meet demand 
if future attacks or acts of war or any acts of retaliation hurt global economic conditions  our business and operating results may be harmed 
we may need to make acquisitions to remain competitive 
from time to time  we may buy businesses  products and technologies that complement or augment our existing businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the cost of potential transactions  competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to complete any given acquisition 
furthermore  in order to finance a potential acquisition  we may need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing money 
we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms  and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing stockholders 
we may need additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain 
if we fail to obtain necessary financing or do so on unattractive terms  our business and operating results could be hurt 
we may need to raise additional capital in order to fund the continued development and marketing of our products or to fund strategic acquisitions or investments 
we expect that our current cash balances  availability under our bank line of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to obtain financing if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
our ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
a financing transaction may also cause us to incur additional indebtedness or accept stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  then we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
our stockholder rights plan and some provisions of our charter may inhibit potential acquisition bids 
we have a classified board of directors and have also adopted a stockholders rights plan  both of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to complete a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company 
while these provisions are intended to enable our board to maximize stockholder value  they may have the effect of discouraging takeovers that could be in the best interest of certain stockholders and may therefore have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock and preventing changes in our management 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in the market value of our investments  our common stock and foreign exchange rates 
market fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
we generally purchase our marketable securities and cash equivalent investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us treasury and government agency obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and money market investments with contractual maturities of one year or less 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable securities and cash equivalent investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
we evaluate the realizable value of these investments using qualitative and quantitative factors including discounted cash flow analysis and liquidation value assessments 
we have made equity investments approved by our board of directors 
these investments are not publicly traded and are recorded as long term investments on the balance sheet and are carried at their estimated realizable value less costs to dispose 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary or mark the investment to fair value and classify them as marketable securities when appropriate 
at december   our investments in private companies had a carrying value of million which are included in investments on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december  crosby finance  llc  a qualified special purpose entity of which we are a member  held approximately million shares of verisign common stock and a variable delivery forward contract  or vdf 
the vdf contract held by crosby will settle in january the vdf contract entitles us to additional cash proceeds of up to million depending on the market price of verisign common stock on january   as follows market price of verisign common stock on january  proceeds to to to million over million we account for our investment in crosby under eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structured notes 
we are carrying our interest at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in income from investing activities in the statement of operations 
we determine the fair value based on the fair value of crosby s right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds under the vdf 
the closing price of verisign s common stock on the nasdaq national market on december  was per share 
unless the verisign stock appreciates to at least per share in january  we will not be entitled to any cash flows from our remaining interest in crosby 
during we recognized a charge of million representing the decline in the fair value of our interest in crosby during our remaining investment in crosby has a fair value of million at december   and is recorded in investments as a long term asset 
should the value of our investment in crosby decrease  we would incur a pretax charge of up to million  which would be included in income from investing activities in the statement of operations 
during  we issued convertible subordinated debentures due october  with an aggregate principal amount of million  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock 
at any time and at their option  each holder may convert any outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which upon conversion of all of the outstanding debentures would result in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the holders of the warrants issued with the debentures may exercise the warrants at any time until october  at an exercise price of per share 
the conversion price of the debentures and the exercise price of the warrants may be adjusted under certain circumstances  such as events that would cause dilution of the holder s interest 
we may redeem all or a portion of the debentures for cash at any time after october  as long as the arithmetic average of the weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day during the fifteen trading day period immediately prior to the election to redeem is at least of the conversion price 
the conversion feature was not exercisable at december  if the convertible debentures are redeemed in part or total prior to their maturity date we will record a non cash charge for unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized value of the warrants 
at december   unamortized deferred financing costs were million and the unamortized value of the warrants was million 
interest is payable in cash semi annually at a fixed rate of per annum  and therefore we believe we have no interest rate exposure with these debentures 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to sales and operating expenses denominated in local currencies 
our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are denominated in us dollars and local currencies  with 
table of contents the majority of our direct sales denominated in us dollars 
our sales through indirect distribution channels are generally denominated in us dollars 
for countries outside the united states  we generally pay our operating expenses in local currency 
when we do invoice customers in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time of invoice until collection occurs 
we are also exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations between the time we collect in us dollars and the time we pay our operating expenses in local currency 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets
