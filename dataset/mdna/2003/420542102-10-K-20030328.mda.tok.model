the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis by reviewing its loan portfolios to identify these inherent losses and to assess the overall probability of collection of these portfolios 
included in this quarterly review is the monitoring of delinquencies  default and historical loss experience  among other factors impacting portfolio risk 
the bank s methodology for assessing the appropriate allowance level consists of several components  which include the allocated general valuation allowance gva  specific valuation allowances sva for identified loans and the unallocated allowance 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses contained herein 
the bank maintains an allowance for credit losses  gva  which is not tied to individual loans or properties 
gvas are maintained for each of the bank s principal loan portfolio components and supplemented by periodic additions through provisions for credit losses 
in measuring the adequacy of the bank s gva  management considers the bank s historical loss experience for each loan portfolio component and in total  the historical migration of loans within each portfolio component and in total  observable trends in the performance of each loan portfolio component  and additional analyses to validate the reasonableness of the bank s gva balance  such as the ffiec interagency examiner benchmark and review of peer information 
the gva includes an unallocated amount  based upon management s evaluation of various conditions  such as general economic and business conditions affecting the bank s key lending areas  the effects of which are not directly measured in the determination of the gva formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
management currently intends to maintain an unallocated allowance  in the range of between and of the total gva  for the inherent risk associated with imprecision in estimating the allowance  and up to approximately to account for the economic uncertainty in southern california until economic or other conditions warrant a reassessment of the level of the unallocated gva 
however  if economic conditions were to deteriorate beyond the weaknesses currently considered by management  it is possible that the gva would be deemed insufficient for the inherent losses in the loan portfolio and further provision might be required 
this could negatively impact earnings for the relevant period

table of contents item legal proceedings litigation the bank is a defendant in a construction defect case entitled stone water terrace hoa v 
hawthorne savings and loan association 
in this action  plaintiff alleges  under several theories of recovery  that the bank is responsible for construction defects in a unit condominium complex 
the bank initially provided construction loans to the developer  but took over the completion of a portion of the project after the developer defaulted 
the bank denies the allegations in the complaint and has cross complained against all of the subcontractors for indemnity 
discovery has commenced  and plaintiffs are claiming damages of approximately million 
in pretrial motions  the court has held that the bank cannot be held liable to plaintiffs in connection with defects found in units which were completed and sold before the bank foreclosed on the project 
although the bank intends to vigorously defend its position in these actions and to seek indemnification from the responsible parties  there can be no assurances that the company will prevail 
in addition  the inherent uncertainty of jury or judicial verdicts makes it impossible to determine with certainty the company s maximum exposure in this action  although based upon the information developed to date  the company believes its exposure will not be material 
however  it is probable that the company will incur substantial legal fees defending this matter 
the company is involved in a variety of other litigation matters in the ordinary course of its business  and anticipates that it will become involved in new litigation matters from time to time in the future 
based on the current assessment of these other matters  management does not presently believe that any one of these existing other matters is likely to have material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  result of operations or cash flows 
however  the company will incur legal and related costs concerning the litigation and may from time to time determine to settle some or all of the cases  regardless of management s assessment of the company s legal position 
the amount of legal defense costs and settlements in any period will depend on many factors  including the status of cases and the number of cases that are in trial or about to be brought to trial and the opposing parties aggressiveness in pursuing their cases and their perception of their legal position 
further  the inherent uncertainty of jury or judicial verdicts makes it impossible to determine with certainty the company s maximum cost in any pending litigation 
accordingly  the company s litigation costs and expenses may vary materially from period to period  and no assurance can be given that these costs will not be material in any particular period

dividends it is the present policy of the company to retain earnings to provide funds for use in its business  however  this policy is evaluated on an on going basis 
the company has not paid cash dividends on the common stock since as a holding company whose only significant asset is the common stock of the bank  the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and to conduct business activities directly or in non banking subsidiaries depends significantly on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from the bank 
federal banking laws and regulations  including the regulations of the ots  limit the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company 
the bank generally may not declare dividends or make any other capital distribution to the company if  after the payment of such dividends or other distribution  the bank would fall within any of the three undercapitalized categories under the prompt corrective action standards established by the ots and the other federal banking agencies 
another regulation of the ots also limits the company s ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions in a manner that depends upon the extent to which it meets regulatory capital requirements 
in addition  hola generally requires savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company to give the ots at least days advance notice of any proposed dividends to be made on its guarantee  permanent or other non withdrawable stock or else the dividend will be invalid 
see item business regulation of the bank capital distribution limitations 
further  the ots may prohibit any dividend or other capital distribution that it determines would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
in addition to the regulation of dividends and other capital distributions  there are various statutory and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the bank can finance or otherwise transfer funds to the company or any of its non banking subsidiaries  whether in the form of loans  extensions of credit  investments or asset purchases 
the director of the ots may further restrict these transactions in the interest of safety and soundness

this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information under item business  item selected financial data  the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented herein 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
additional accounting policies are described in detail in note summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  included herein 
the company s most complex and critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of the company s current accounting polices involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for credit losses management evaluates the allowance for credit losses in accordance with gaap  within the guidance established by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  sab  selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  as well as standards established by regulatory interagency policy statements on the alll 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis by reviewing its loan portfolio to identify these inherent losses and to assess the overall probability of collection of the loans in the portfolio 
included in this quarterly review is the monitoring of delinquencies  default and historical loss experience  among other factors impacting portfolio risk 
the bank s methodology for assessing the appropriate allowance level consists of several components  which include the allocated and unallocated gva and sva for identified loans 
management separates loans into pools by loan type and risk factor ie loan grade 
the grading system is designed to evaluate risk 
loan grading provides management with information regarding actual or potential loan problems and provides a basis for establishing action plans to strengthen credits 
management segments its portfolio into pools with similar characteristics  based on loan type collateral driven and risk factor loan grade 
the primary factors used in assigning risk factors loan grades include capacity and willingness of borrower guarantor to service debt considering current financial data  cash flow of the underlying real estate collateral  the borrower s ability to service existing debts  alternate sources of repayment  trade and bank payment history  effects of current and anticipated market and economic conditions  impact of interest rate fluctuations  collateral value and the borrower s ability to refinance collateral based on current value  property tax status  payment status  status of insurance and taxes  and  existence of other liens 
currently  the portfolio is segmented by collateral type  further stratified by loan grade pass grades  and  special mention and substandard 
a brief description of these classifications follows the three pass loan grades represent a level of credit quality  which ranges from high quality assets with no well defined deficiency or weakness  to some noted weakness with average risk and nominal loss potential 

table of contents special mention assets have potential weaknesses that require close monitoring by management  but do not currently possess characteristics that would expose the bank to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification 
substandard assets  grade  have a well defined weakness  which are characterized by the potential loss to the bank if the deficiencies are not corrected 
occasionally a loan in this category might require an sva and is evaluated on a case by case basis 
substandard assets  grade  are assets that display weaknesses described above under grade  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make full collection of the debt questionable 
these loans may be placed on nonaccrual status 
some of these assets may be considered impaired under sfas no 
and an analysis is performed to determine if there is a need for a sva 
management establishes svas for credit losses on individual loans when it has determined that recovery of the bank s gross investment is not probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably determined 
sfas no 
defines loan impairment as the existence of uncertainty concerning collection of all principal and interest per the contractual terms of a loan 
nonaccrual loans and loans which are considered troubled debt restructures tdr are typically impaired and analyzed individually for svas 
for collateral dependent loans  impairment is typically considered measured by comparing the loan amount to the fair value of collateral determined via appraisals and or internal valuations  less costs to sell  with a sva established for the shortfall amount 
other methods can be used to estimate impairment market price or present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original interest rate 
the bank currently has a sva of million for one loan 
the gva includes an unallocated amount 
the unallocated allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions  such as general economic and business conditions affecting the bank s key lending areas  the effects of which are not directly measured in the determination of the gva formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
in evaluating the inherent risk associated with imprecision in estimating the allowance  management has determined it to be prudent to maintain an unallocated allowance  in the range of between and of the total gva 
in addition  management currently intends to maintain an unallocated allowance of up to approximately to account for the economic uncertainty in southern california until economic or other conditions warrant a reassessment of the level of the unallocated gva 
management believes that the provision for credit losses was at an adequate level during and that the allowance for credit losses of million at december   is adequate to absorb the losses that  in the opinion and judgment of management  are known or inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
nonaccrual loans the bank generally ceases to accrue interest on a loan when principal or interest has been contractually delinquent for a period of days or more  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection  or  full collection of principal and or interest is not reasonably assured 
in addition  classified construction loans for which interest is being paid from interest reserve loan funds  rather than the borrower s own funds  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current  the loan is paying in accordance with its payment terms for a period  typically between three to six months  and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
real estate owned properties acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure real estate owned  reo  are transferred to reo and carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the property fair value 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a 
table of contents loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the reo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value incorporates revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  construction and renovation costs  marketing and transaction costs and holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the reo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  if the bank originates a loan to facilitate the sale of the reo property  revenue recognition upon disposition of the property is dependent upon the sale having met certain criteria relating to the buyer s initial investment in the property sold 
gains and losses from sales of real estate owned properties are reflected in income from real estate operations  net in the consolidated statements of income 
investment securities the investment policy of the bank seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing the bank s lending activities 
the bank s policies generally limit investments to government and federal agency backed securities and other non government guaranteed securities  including investment grade debt obligations 
the bank s investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of the security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under sfas no 
 investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
currently  all investment securities of the bank are classified as available for sale 
the unrealized gains and losses for these securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income  as part of stockholders equity 
the company is obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is other than temporary impairment to its investment securities 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date 
the company had no impaired investment securities during purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
intangible assets as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates amortization of goodwill  the company is required to evaluate goodwill annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
since the company s acquisition of first fidelity occurred on august   intangible assets associated with this acquisition  which has been allocated to the company s only operating segment the bank  will be evaluated in and impairment  if any  will be reflected in the financial statements

the operations of the company are substantially dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned from its interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest margin is its net interest income divided by its average interest earning assets 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors  including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between the repricing or maturity of the company s adjustable rate and fixed rate loans and the repricing of the company s liabilities which include deposits and fhlb advances  the speed at which loans prepay and the impact of internal interest rate floors  and the magnitude of the company s noninterest earning assets  including nonaccrual loans and reo 

table of contents the company s net interest income before provision for credit losses increased to million  for the year ended december   compared with million during the same period in the company s year over year increase in net interest income was due to a more stable interest rate environment in  as the federal reserve lowered rates once in  compared with eleven times during  inclusion of first fidelity net assets as of august   the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased faster than the decrease in the yield earned on average earning assets  the majority of adjustable rate loans reached their contractual floors  the initiation of treasury activities which resulted in incremental income from investment securities  and the collection of million in interest on real estate loans that were brought current in the first quarter of the company is a variable rate lender and although the static gap report shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive  during  the repricing behavior more closely approximates a liability sensitive balance sheet  as the majority of its arm loans reached their contractual floors 
as of december   of the loans in the company s loan portfolio were adjustable rate  of which approximately  or billion  have reached their internal interest rate floors and thus have taken on fixed rate characteristics 
the substantial majority of such loans are priced at a margin over various market sensitive indices  including mta of the portfolio  libor of the portfolio  prime of the portfolio  cofi of the portfolio and cmt of the portfolio 
it is expected that when or if interest rates rise to levels above the floors in the loan portfolio  the company will once again behave as an asset sensitive institution 
as borrowers refinanced loans  the company continued to experience prepayments of million with a weighted average interest rate of  for the year ended december  the negative impact of prepayments was partially mitigated by new loan production of million with a weighted average rate of  for the year ended december  the yield on interest earning assets was for the year ended december   compared with for based upon the continued projected decline in the effective yield of the lagging indices  the company expects that the yield on its loan portfolio will decline in the future as the decreases in current market interest rates are fully incorporated 
at december   of the company s interest bearing deposits were comprised of certificate accounts  with an original weighted average term of months  compared with with an original weighted average term of months at december  the remaining  weighted average term to maturity for the company s certificate accounts approximated months at december   compared with months at december  generally  the company s offering rates for certificate accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
as of december   of the company s borrowings from the fhlb were fixed rate  with remaining terms ranging from day to years  compared with with remaining terms ranging from to years at december  though such remaining terms are subject to early call provisions 
the remaining and of the borrowings at december  and december   respectively  carried adjustable interest rates and mature in february  with and  respectively  of the adjustable borrowings tied to the prime rate 
assuming a flat interest rate environment  previously announced guidance that the net interest margin will be in the range of to for remains unchanged 
however  if rates were to increase  the net interest margin will be compressed until loan rates exceed floors

the company continued to experience prepayments of million with a weighted average interest rate of  as borrowers refinanced loans  while new loan production of million reflected a weighted average rate of  for the year ended december  the net decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase of million earned on investment securities 
interest costs decreased by million  or  during the year ended december   compared with the same period in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was primarily attributable to a basis point decrease in the average cost of funds  to for the year ended december   from for the same period of the reduction in the cost of funds is the result of the combination of the continued downward pressure on interest rates rates on new certificates of deposit were generally lower than the maturing certificates of deposit and the shift in the deposit mix during the increase in average interest bearing liabilities for the year ended december   compared with was primarily due to increases of million and million  in the average balance of average interest

however  the company s net interest income was impacted by the basis point and basis point drop in interest rates during and  respectively  and continues to be adversely impacted by lower yields on new loan productions  continued runoff of existing loans  and repricing of the respective indices 
in a rising interest rate environment these adjustable rate loans  that have taken on fixed rate loan characteristics  will result in potential net interest margin compression 
these loans will not reprice until rates have increased enough to bring the fully indexed rate above the internal floor rate  while interest bearing deposits will reprice more quickly 
provision for credit losses provision for credit losses were million and million for and  respectively

at december   the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans receivable  net of specific allowance  was  compared with at december  although the bank maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level which it considers to be adequate to absorb the losses that  in the opinion and judgment of management  are known and inherent in the bank s loan portfolio  there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations 
the calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  and therefore the requisite amount of provision for credit losses  is based on several factors  including underlying loan collateral values  delinquency trends and historical loan loss experience  as discussed herein  all of which can change without notice based on market and economic conditions and other factors

interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr and credit risk constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions 
please refer to item business  loan portfolio  for a thorough discussion of the company s lending activities 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon the company s net interest income nii and theoretical liquidation value  also referred to as net portfolio value npv 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
changes in the nii the net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest expensed on deposits and borrowings 
the volumes and yields on loans  investments  deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   of the company s loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices  such as mta  libor  prime  cofi and cmt 
as of december   billion  or  of the company s adjustable rate net loan portfolio had reached their internal interest rate floors 
these loans will take on fixed rate repricing characteristics until sufficient upward interest rate movements will bring the fully indexed rate above their internal interest rate floors 
the bank s investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of the security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
at december   of the company s interest bearing deposits were comprised of certificate accounts  with an original weighted average term of months 
the remaining  weighted average term to 
table of contents maturity for the company s certificate accounts approximated months at december  generally  the company s offering rates for certificate accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
as of december   of the company s borrowings from the fhlb are fixed rate  with remaining terms ranging from day to years though such remaining terms are subject to early call provisions 
the remaining of the borrowings carry an adjustable interest rate  with of the adjustable borrowings tied to the prime rate  maturing in february the company intends to roll these borrowings into shorter term and overnight maturities in the near term and expects to extend these liabilities sometime during changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect the company s interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the repricing of the adjustable rate loans and the repricing of the deposits and borrowings 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the company s assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr and various other risks including liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by  reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
alco seeks to stabilize the company s nii and npv by matching its rate sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets within specified time periods  the nii generally will be negatively impacted by increasing rates and positively impacted by decreasing rates 
conversely  when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities within specified time periods  net interest income will generally be positively impacted by increasing rates and negatively impacted by decreasing rates 
the speed and velocity of the repricing of assets and liabilities will also contribute to the effects on the company s nii and npv  as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime internal interest rate caps and floors 
the benefit of the bank s asset sensitive balance sheet will be mitigated by the billion in loans that have reached contractual floors that will not immediately reprice upwards in a rising interest rate environment 
in fact  although the bank is technically asset sensitive  due to the floors  the repricing behavior more closely approximates a liability sensitive balance sheet 
these adjustable loans have taken on fixed rate loan characteristics and will not reprice until rates have increased enough to bring the fully indexed rate above the internal floor rate 
the company utilizes two methods for measuring interest rate risk  gap analysis and interest rate simulations 
gap analysis focuses on measuring absolute dollar amounts subject to repricing within certain periods of time  specifically the one year horizon 
interest rate simulations are produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the company s financial instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current levels of applicable financial instruments 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and  consequently  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
a traditional  although analytically limited measure  of a financial institution s irr is the static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted for any off balance sheet positions which are expected to mature or reprice within a specific period 
generally  a positive gap benefits an institution during periods of rising interest rates  and a negative gap benefits an institution during periods of declining interest rates 
however  because of the floors on loans  and because a portion of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to indices that may lag changes in market interest rates by three months or more  the static gap analysis is not the most effective tool to measure the company s sensitivity to interest rates 

table of contents although the cumulative static gap position indicates an asset sensitive position  the company s net interest income will be impacted by the significant amount of adjustable rate loans that have reached floor interest rates in excess of current market rates 
in a rising rate environment  the company s liabilities within a cumulative static gap period will reprice upward to market rates while the loan portfolio may not reprice up because of the floors  causing a reduction in net interest income 
conversely  in a declining rate environment  the company s liabilities will continue to reprice downward  while its loan portfolio remains at its floor rates  thereby creating an increase in net interest income 
interest rate simulations provide the company with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in nii under various rate scenarios 
normally  all assets and liabilities are subjected to tests of up to basis points in increases and decreases in interest rates in basis point increments 
under each interest rate scenario  the company projects its net interest income and the npv of its current balance sheet 
from these results  the company can then develop alternatives in dealing with the tolerance thresholds 
with the sharp decline in interest rates during  the rate shock scenarios for a decrease in rates became unpredictable 
many of the current deposit rates and market indices such as libor were below 
as a result  a rate shock down of or even basis points was not possible 
with concurrence from the ots  for december   rate shocks were performed for  and basis points up  and basis points down 
the company utilizes internal interest rate floors and caps on individual loans to mitigate the risk of interest margin compression 
the risk to the company associated with the internal interest rate floors is that interest rates may decline  and the borrower may choose to refinance the loan  either with the company or with another financial institution  resulting in the company having to replace the higher yielding asset at a lower rate 
due to the interest rate environment  which continued into  prepayment speeds continued to increase 
if this trend continues in  it could negatively impact growth in interest earning assets and the overall yield  which in turn could negatively impact net income and operational efficiency 
the company is also exposed to risks associated with interest rate caps in that interest rate increases could exceed the maximum rates allowed on such loans while the company s cost of funds continues to rise 
as a result  the interest income derived from these loans would remain at the cap  resulting in an overall compression on net interest income 
the following table sets forth information concerning repricing opportunities for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amount of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual maturities  except that adjustable rate products are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability mix to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the company s income to the extent that the interest rates borne by the assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor its interest rate risk exposure 
as a part of this effort  the company uses the npv methodology to gauge irr exposure 
using an internally generated model  the company monitors interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cashflows on interest earning assets and other assets  and the outgoing cashflows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the npv ratio is defined as the npv for a given rate scenario 
table of contents divided by the market value of the assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  whichever produces the largest decline 
by agreement with the ots  the downward rate shock was performed for basis points down only  due to the overall compression of rates 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure  the greater is considered its exposure to irr 
the ots also produces a similar analysis using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial report tfr 
at december   based on the company s internally generated model  it was estimated that the company s npv ratio was in the event of a basis point increase in rates  an increase of from basecase of 
if rates were to decrease by basis points  the company s npv ratio was estimated at  an increase of from basecase 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of the company s irr as measured in the npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of   and basis point increments in market interest rates 
net portfolio value dollars in thousands change from change from change in rates amount basecase ratio basecase bp  bp bp   bp bp   bp bp bp   bp bp n a n a n a n a bp n a n a n a n a management believes that the npv methodology overcomes several shortcomings of the typical static gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected cash flows  weighing each by its appropriate discount factor 
second  because the npv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an association s irr exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
in addition  npv takes into account the caps and floors on loans 
in the table shown above  this is reflected in the uses of value in the up bp and bp scenarios and the gain in value in the down bp scenario 
the adjustable rate loans that have reached their floors gain value as rates drop and lose value as rates rise until each loan s floor is exceeded 
this table demonstrates an anticipated decrease in value until rates have increased bp or more  as liabilities reprise upward and earning asset yields remain stagnant 
on a quarterly basis  the results of the internally generated model are reconciled to the results of the ots model 
historically the ots has valued the npv higher 
this is the result of the company using local market data compared to national data when establishing market value 
the ots model does not take into account floors on loans 
however  based on both the company s model and the regulatory model  in accordance with the ots guideline s interest rate sensitivity measure  the company falls within the ots minimal risk category
