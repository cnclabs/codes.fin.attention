item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year  universal made substantial investments in its operations  investing about million in leaf processing facilities in the united states and about million in acquiring operations for its non tobacco segments 
the replacement of tobacco volumes lost because of the zimbabwe crop decline required additional investment in working capital in africa 
the company secured additional sources of liquidity to fund these needs  and it maintains a relatively large portion of total debt as long term to reduce liquidity risk 
working capital increased by over million to million  and the current ratio increased from to 
tobacco inventories increased about million to million as of june   but the company s uncommitted inventories remained relatively flat at approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year lumber and building products inventories and accounts receivable increased by million and million  respectively  due to the strong euro and the january acquisition of j w 
customer advances and deposits fell by approximately  to million  in part because relative interest rates made funding by universal more attractive than it had been last year 
advances to suppliers increased by about million  and approximately million of that increase occurred in africa where the company has been making investments in several african countries to replace volume declines in zimbabwe 
the company s capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value to the customer  replace equipment  increase efficiency  or position the company for future growth 
universal s capital expenditures were approximately million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year approximately million of the capital expenditures in fiscal were part of a major investment in leaf processing in the united states that was announced in fiscal year the company completed an upgrade of its facility in danville  virginia  in the summer of  and has recently built a new facility in nash county  north carolina  which is currently in start up mode 
the cost of the two projects is estimated to be over million 
the company elected to partially fund the projects using a secured  multi draw million term loan facility  which a wholly owned subsidiary obtained on december  the facility is guaranteed by the company and is secured by certain assets of the projects 
the loan matures on december   and under certain conditions  the subsidiary can exercise an extension option for an additional four years 
as of june   approximately million had been drawn under the facility 
universal s total debt increased by about million during the year  and its total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including deferred taxes and minority interest increased to about from approximately in fiscal year the increase in debt reflected the company s increased working capital requirement  the j w acquisition  and increased capital spending 
total long term obligations  including current maturities  increased by million to million while notes payable increased by million to million 
the increase in long term obligations was primarily due to the company s new bank facilities entered into on april  those facilities included a million term loan that will mature on april  earlier in fiscal year  the company issued million in medium term notes  thereby completing the sale of all securities registered pursuant to a million shelf registration filed in in  the company filed a new million shelf registration for debt securities  and in august  the securities and exchange commission declared it effective 
the company expects to use the proceeds of sales of these securities for general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment of indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and working capital 
the company also continued to draw on its secured multi draw facility used to fund the us processing expenditures 
as of june   the company had interest rate swaps that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
the purpose of these interest rate swaps is to better match its effective interest rate to the market rates of interest that customers pay the company for inventory purchased for their accounts 
these swaps were accounted for as fair value hedges 
the estimated fair value of the swap agreements was approximately million at june  as of june   universal had approximately million in uncommitted lines of credit  of which approximately million was unused and available to support seasonal working capital needs 
effective april   the company replaced its million revolving credit facilities with new agreements totaling million 
these agreements include a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan  each of which will mature on april  as of june   the company had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
universal s commercial paper program  which provides flexibility in the company s short term borrowings  is supported by the new revolving credit facility 
under the terms of its bank agreements  the company must maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and working capital and observe restrictions on debt levels 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at june management believes that the company has adequate resources available to meet its needs  which have been predominantly short term in nature and primarily relate to working capital required for tobacco crop purchases 
working capital needs are seasonal within each geographical region 
the geographical dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit universal to predict its general level of cash requirements 
the marketing of the crop in each geographic area is heavily influenced by weather conditions and follows the cycle of buying  processing  and shipping of the tobacco crop 
the timing of individual customer shipping requirements may change the level or the duration of crop financing 
the working capital needs of agri products operations fluctuate during the year  depending on the product  the country of origin  and the company s inventory position  however  the total working capital requirements of agri products remain relatively stable due to offsetting seasonal patterns 
working capital needs of lumber and building products operations in europe follow a pattern similar to that of the construction industry  where the third quarter of the fiscal year is typically sluggish due to winter weather and the holiday season 
the company finances its seasonal working capital needs with short term lines of credit  customer advances  and trade payables 
the company estimates that its inventories of flue cured and burley tobaccos that were not committed to customers as of june   were approximately million 
as a percentage of inventory  uncommitted inventories decreased from of total tobacco inventory at june   to of total tobacco inventory at june  management does not consider these levels to be excessive 
during the next to months  management expects to continue to invest additional amounts in working capital and operating facilities to increase african tobacco sources 
for example  the company has decided to invest about million in a new processing facility in mozambique 
the project will include infrastructure  such as school facilities and a clinic 
in may  universal s board of directors approved a share purchase program that has since been expanded to permit the purchase of up to million of the common stock of the company 
the purchases are carried out from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices not exceeding prevailing market prices 
over time  the purchases have been  and are expected to be  funded primarily from operating cash flow of the company 
at june   universal had approximately million common shares outstanding and had purchased approximately million common shares for about million pursuant to the program 
funds supporting the company s erisa regulated defined benefit pension plans were reduced to million by negative market activity during fiscal year through the quarter ended march   the remeasurement date for the plan 
subsequent to that time markets have improved  and the market value of the fund has increased 
as of july   the market value of the fund was about million  compared to the accumulated benefit obligation of million and the projected benefit obligation of million based on certain assumptions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company plans to contribute approximately million to the pension fund during the next year  which is more than the contribution required by erisa 
it is the company s policy to monitor the market performance of the funds and to review the adequacy of its funding and its contributions to those funds 
the fund is managed for long term returns  and the company has not changed its investment allocation in response to recent market returns 
management believes that its financial resources are adequate to support its capital needs 
those resources include cash from operations  cash balances  the potential to issue debt to the public under its new shelf registration statement  the amounts remaining on its multi draw secured facility  and committed and uncommitted bank lines 
any excess cash flow from operations after dividends and capital expenditures will be available to fund expansion  purchase the company s stock  or otherwise enhance shareholder value 
the company s contractual obligations as of june   are as follows payments due in s total thereafter notes payable and current portion of long term debt long term debt total results of operations fiscal year compared to sales and other operating revenues were approximately billion for the fiscal year compared to about billion last year 
the fiscal year benefited from the impact of the stronger euro on translation of revenues from the company s dutch lumber and building products operations into us dollars and the fourth quarter addition of the revenues of j w 
most of the tobacco segment revenue increase for the fiscal year came from the larger volumes shipped from south america 
agri products segment revenue was up modestly due to good results in the company s dried fruit and nuts business 
during fiscal year  universal recognized approximately million in restructuring charges  of which million resulted from the reduction of operations in zimbabwe due to the decline in crops there 
the remaining million represented costs of rationalizing us operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may  the company entered an agreement to settle the deloach lawsuit  which involved alleged industry violation of antitrust laws  and accordingly recorded a charge of million in fiscal year the agreement is subject to the final approval of the court 
in addition  during the fourth quarter  the company recognized a million gain on the sale of assets in africa and the netherlands as well as a million gain on remeasurement of local currency liabilities after export rates were adjusted in africa 
the remeasurement gain was not taxable in the country of origin  and consistent with universal s policy regarding permanently reinvested earnings  no provision for us income taxes was made on the gain 
the aggregate of the charges and gains for the year was a charge of million 
in fiscal year  the company recorded charges of million related to the consolidation of us operations and million related to argentine currency devaluation 
summary of charges and gains in millions except per share amounts fiscal year fiscal year change restructuring charges tobacco segment settlement of lawsuit african currency remeasurement gain fiscal year gain on asset sales argentine currency devaluation consolidation costs net gain charge lumber building products segment fiscal year gain on asset sales increase decrease in operating income increase decrease in net income increase decrease in earnings per share fiscal year segment operating income as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements was million  up million from that of fiscal year as listed above  that increase included a million net gain in the tobacco segment and a million gain in lumber and building products segment 
tobacco segment earnings benefited from larger crops in brazil  argentina  and several african countries  and those increases more than offset the decline in zimbabwe crops 
shipments of brazilian and argentine tobaccos increased substantially  as customers shifted purchase requirements from zimbabwe to brazil and purchased more argentine tobacco following the currency devaluation there in dark tobacco volumes were down for the fiscal year due to lower sales of old crop tobacco this year and smaller crops in several origins 
the oriental tobacco joint venture s results also declined primarily due to customers delay of shipments until fiscal year  expenses related to the new plants in greece and bulgaria  and smaller shipments of old crop tobacco this year 
excluding the million net effect of the charges and gains listed in the table above  tobacco segment earnings decreased by million for the fiscal year 
buoyed by the strong euro  which gained more than on average during fiscal year against the us dollar  results from the lumber and building products segment improved by million  or for the year  excluding the million gain on sale of assets 
throughout the year  volume suffered from the effects of an economic slowdown in the netherlands and other european countries 
however  the results benefited from the company s acquisition of j w 
earnings from the agri products segment were flat for the year as stronger results in the company s dried fruit and nut business offset the impact of difficult market conditions in the remainder of the segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by million or due to the million charge for the settlement of the deloach lawsuit  the impact of the strong euro on euro based expenses  the addition of j w  and higher legal expenses as well as insurance costs 
these amounts were partially offset by a net remeasurement gain of million 
interest expense decreased by million to million due to lower interest rates in fiscal year compared to the company capitalized approximately million in interest related to the construction of the nash facility in fiscal year and approximately thousand last year 
universal s consolidated income tax rate for the current year is compared to in the prior year 
the major factor that generated the decrease in the tax rate for the company was the impact of lower taxes in subsidiaries in which it is the company s policy to permanently reinvest earnings 
the company currently does not record us tax expense on earnings not distributed from most countries in africa 
the company generated over million in remeasurement gains that were not subject to local tax expense in these countries 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year compared to sales and other operating revenues for fiscal year decreased million or to billion compared to fiscal year the majority of the decline in fiscal year was in the tobacco segment  where revenue fell by million 
although smaller crops in a number of key exporting areas reduced volumes  the primary factor in the revenue reduction for fiscal year was the change in manufacturers purchasing methods in the united states 
in fiscal year  a number of us manufacturers bought tobacco directly from farmers through contracts and paid leaf merchants to process it 
prior to fiscal year  leaf dealers purchased tobacco for most us manufacturers 
for the years ended june  and  revenue from subsidiaries and affiliates of altria group  inc formerly philip morris companies inc  was million and million  respectively 
beginning with the us burley crop in fiscal year  followed by both the us flue cured and burley crops in fiscal year  philip morris usa inc began to purchase directly from growers under contract arrangements 
although this change was the primary cause of the decline in revenue in fiscal year  it did not have a commensurate effect on segment operating income in fiscal year because the company continued to process its normal share of the crops 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues of the agri products segment were down by million in fiscal year due to lower tea prices and sharply lower synthetic rubber sales in europe 
lumber and building products revenue increased by million in fiscal year due to higher sales of garden timbers and garden houses by an acquired company 
segment operating income as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
tobacco operating profits in fiscal year were million  a decline of million compared to fiscal year tobacco operating profits declined in fiscal year due to smaller crops in several origins  including zimbabwe  malawi  and poland 
us operations experienced higher costs in fiscal year from staffing both contract receiving stations and the auction system  as well as a decline in green market service income compared to fiscal year the company no longer received purchasing fees on us volumes for which it only provided processing services 
in addition  overall margins on sales of brazilian tobacco in fiscal year were lower due to the mix of business there 
during fiscal year  the company recognized million in expenses related to the argentine currency devaluation and the company accelerated the planned closure of its henderson  north carolina  facility in fiscal year as a result of the closure and after us consolidation measures  the company recognized million in costs in fiscal year increased earnings from higher volumes shipped from argentina  asia  western europe  and the company s oriental tobacco joint venture were not sufficient to overcome these factors for fiscal year results for the company s lumber and building operations were down for fiscal year  reflecting  in part  the impact of the strong us dollar during that year 
agri products earnings declined for fiscal year  as stronger results in the company s dried fruit and nut business were not sufficient to overcome the impact of difficult market conditions in rubber  sunflower seeds  and tea 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased million due to higher lumber and building product selling costs and higher pension expense 
interest expense for fiscal year decreased by million to million due to lower interest rates in fiscal year compared to the company s consolidated income tax rate for fiscal year declined from for fiscal year to approximately due to the mix of foreign and domestic earnings

the provisions of interpretation no 
were effective beginning in the company s third quarter of fiscal year the adoption of interpretation no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company  including information about contingencies  risk  and financial condition 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
however  changes in the assumptions used could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas inventories inventories of tobacco and agri products are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the specific cost method 
in the tobacco and agri product businesses  raw materials are clearly identified at the time of purchase 
the company tracks the costs associated with raw materials in the final product lots  and maintains this identification through the time of sale 
the company also capitalizes direct and indirect costs related to processing raw materials 
this method of cost accounting is referred to as the specific cost or specific identification method 
lumber and building products inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method 
the company writes down inventory for changes in market value based upon assumptions related to future demand and market conditions 
future demand assumptions can be impacted by changes in customer sales  changes in customers inventory positions and policies  competitors pricing policies and inventory positions  changing customer needs  and varying crop sizes and qualities 
market conditions that differ significantly from those assumed by management could result in additional write downs 
the company experiences inventory write downs routinely 
inventory write downs in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill as necessary  and at least annually  utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
the preparation of discounted future operating cash flow analyses requires significant management judgment with respect to operating earnings growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the majority of the company s goodwill is from acquisitions in the tobacco segment 
neither a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption nor a one percentage point decline in the cash flow growth rate assumption would result in an impairment charge 
however  significant changes in estimates of future cash flows  such as those caused by unforeseen events or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on its expected income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and evaluating the tax position of the company 
the effective tax rate is applied to quarterly operating results 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and could be subject to a tax audit in each of these jurisdictions  which could result in changes to estimated taxes 
in the event that there is a significant  unusual  or one time item recognized in the company s results  the tax attributed to that item would be recorded at the same time as the item 
for example  in the current year  the remeasurement gains generated in africa did not result in local taxation  and consistent with company policy regarding permanently reinvested earnings  no provision for us income taxes was recorded on the gains  which reduced the consolidated tax rate 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in its tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not tax deductible  while others are related to timing issues  such as differences in depreciation methods 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in its financial statements 
the company has recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of estimated future taxable income was not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
as of june   the company had approximately million in foreign tax credit carryforwards 
if not utilized earlier  credits of million will expire at the end of fiscal year  and million will expire at the end of fiscal year any significant reduction in future taxable income and changes in its sources or changes in us or foreign tax laws could result in the expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s financial statements for which payment has been deferred or an expense that has not yet been recognized in the financial statements and has been deducted in the company s tax return 
for example  the company has recognized million in us income tax expense associated with foreign earnings  which the company intends to distribute to the united states in the future 
for additional disclosures on income taxes see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the measurement of the company s pension and postretirement obligations and costs are dependent on a variety of assumptions used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimating the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
the assumptions made by the company may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the significant assumptions used in the calculation of pension and postretirement obligations are discount rate the discount rate is based on investment yields available at the measurement date on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
salary growth the salary growth assumption is a factor of the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook  and assumed inflation 
expected return on plan assets the expected return reflects asset allocations and investment strategy 
retirement and mortality rates retirement rates are based on actual plan experience along with the company s near term outlook 
early retirement assumptions are based on actual company experience 
mortality rates are based on standard group annuity ga mortality tables 
health care cost trends for postretirement medical plan obligations and costs  the company makes assumptions on future increases in medical costs 
these assumptions are based on the actual experience of the company along with third party forecasts of long term medical cost trends 
the effect of actual results differing from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect its recognized expense in such future periods 
sensitivity analysis 
the effect of the indicated decrease or increase in the selected assumptions is shown below  assuming no change in benefit levels effect on projected benefit obligation increase decrease in s effect on annual expense increase decrease in s change in assumption pension plans increase in discount rate decrease in discount rate increase in salary scale decrease in salary scale increase in rate of return on assets decrease in rate of return on assets change in assumption other postretirement benefits increase in discount rate decrease in discount rate increase in medical inflation decrease in medical inflation see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefit plans 
other information regarding trends and management s actions world markets for flue cured and burley tobaccos are currently approximately in balance and are expected to remain so through crop year as overall availability should meet demand  however  worldwide inventories of oriental tobaccos remain high and no reduction is expected through next year 
management expects world flue cured production to decline in crop year as smaller crops are forecast in both brazil and zimbabwe 
in crop year  management believes flue cured production should increase again in all exporting regions  except asia and north america 
burley production is also expected to decrease in crop year primarily because of smaller crops in brazil and africa 
burley crops in are also expected to trend upward again in nearly all regions 
generally  production changes in and will affect the company s fiscal years and  respectively  as crops produced in crop year are normally sold in fiscal year after increasing at a compound annual growth rate in excess of over the previous two years  cigarette production flattened in the earlier increases were due in part to improving economic conditions in asia and the former soviet union  and the stronger demand for leaf helped to reduce leaf inventories 
the company expects that demand for leaf will be flat or declining slightly for the near term primarily due to the flattening trend in world cigarette consumption and to improved leaf utilization by cigarette manufacturers 
on a year to year basis  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in leaf supply due to crop size and leaf demand as manufacturers adjust inventories or respond to changes in the cigarette market 
uncommitted worldwide industry flue cured and burley inventories totaled million kilos  excluding inventories of asian government owned monopolies 
uncommitted inventories  which had been trending upward since mid  have declined in each of the last three years 
at june   the us stabilization cooperatives held about million kilos 
although cigar consumption continues to grow at a modest pace in the united states  consumption within the main european union markets has declined slightly 
supplies of filler and binder tobaccos remain in relative surplus due to overproduction in certain countries coupled with manufacturers downward adjustment of inventory levels to match expected sales 
supply and demand of cigar wrapper continues to be firm 
within the smokeless segment of the dark tobacco business  consumption of loose leaf chewing tobacco continues to decline by about four percent annually  while the consumption of snuff products has been growing between three and four percent per year 
management believes that there is an adequate supply of suitable dark tobacco in the world market to meet the demand of the manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products 
the high price of us leaf relative to the world market led to reduced exports  which  combined with declining purchases by us manufacturers  have reduced the amount of us tobacco that can be produced and sold in the united states 
the company has responded to the decrease in demand for  and production of  us tobacco and the change in the us marketing system by closing certain plants  restructuring operations  and reducing personnel 
since fiscal year  the company has closed four large  high volume  older tobacco processing plants and replaced them with a new state of the art processing facility in nash county  north carolina  and with an upgraded facility in danville  virginia 
the company has recorded over million in charges associated with the reduction in us tobacco production and consolidation of us operations since fiscal year domestic leaf purchases are unlikely to increase because of the continued decline of cigarette consumption in the united states 
exports of us leaf are likely to continue to decline unless the us tobacco program is significantly modified or eliminated and the competitive position of us leaf improves dramatically 
several proposals to change that program are currently being discussed in the us congress 
these proposals generally call for quota buy out and some modifications in the existing tobacco program 
management believes that a quota buy out will not provide sufficient improvement unless the entire system of government supports is dismantled 
without substantial improvement in the market attractiveness of us leaf  foreign manufacturers are likely to continue to shift their purchases to other tobacco producing areas  such as brazil and africa where the company has significant operations 
the company expects market conditions to remain challenging in the year ahead 
management continues to closely monitor the situation in zimbabwe where the political and economic environment remains extremely difficult 
the size of the flue cured crop now being marketed is expected to be about below that of last year 
the volume decline is expected to be partially offset by production increases in brazil and in other african origins 
early indications are that the zimbabwe crop to be marketed in fiscal year could be substantially smaller than the crop currently being marketed 
that crop has not yet been planted 
because the company expects that most of the shortfall in zimbabwe tobacco will be replaced with crops from areas where the company contracts with and provides financing to farmers  the company could face increased financing and inventory risk since zimbabwe tobacco is purchased at auction 
the company has been working to expand sources of african tobacco  and those efforts require investments in working capital and operating facilities 
an important trend in the tobacco industry has been consolidation among manufacturers of tobacco products 
this trend is expected to continue  particularly as further privatization of state monopolies occurs  providing opportunities for acquisitions by international manufacturers 
this concentration could provide additional opportunities for international leaf merchants  including universal 
a key success factor for leaf dealers in the future will be the ability to provide customers with the quality of leaf and the level of service they desire at the lowest cost possible 
in addition  the leaf dealers have larger historical market shares with some customers than with others 
consequently  the company s potential growth will be affected by the growth of its major customers  and consolidation of customers may have at least a short term favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s business 
reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of smoking have been publicized for many years and  together with decreased social acceptance of smoking and increased pressure from anti smoking groups  have had an ongoing adverse effect on sales of tobacco products  particularly in the united states 
in addition  the major us tobacco product manufacturers entered into agreements with states and various us jurisdictions settling asserted and unasserted healthcare cost recovery and other claims 
the settlements provide for billions of dollars in annual payments from those manufacturers and place numerous restrictions on their conduct of business  including restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes  which have reduced tobacco consumption and  therefore  demand for the company s products and services in the united states 
significant decreases in consumption of tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the european union and other countries have also imposed limitations on the advertising of cigarettes 
a significant decrease in global sales of tobacco products brought about by health concerns  decreased social acceptance  advertisement limitations  or other factors would reduce demand for the company s products and services 
in fiscal year  the weakness in the us dollar in relation to the euro has benefited the lumber and building products sector  which uses the euro as its functional currency 
further changes in exchange rates will affect the translation of the euro earnings of the company into us dollars 
in addition  a continued decline in construction activity in the netherlands could negatively affect sales volumes and margins 
conversely  an increase of such activity could provide an opportunity for volume and margin expansion 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and from time to time contests assessments of taxes due 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect the company s earnings as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues 
the consolidated income tax rate is affected by a number of factors  including but not limited to the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and investments  local tax rates of subsidiaries  repatriation of foreign earnings  and the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
in recent years  the company s domestic income has been declining while foreign income has been increasing 
if this trend continues and tax rates remain constant worldwide  the company could be less able to utilize its foreign tax credits and the company s consolidated income tax rate would increase 
factors that may affect future results the foregoing discussion contains certain forward looking statements  which may be identified by phrases such as the company expects or management believes or words of similar effect 
in addition  the company may publish  from time to time  forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects and similar matters 
the following important factors  among other things  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for a fiscal year and any interim period to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the company assumes no duty to update any of the statements in this report 
operating factors the leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive and universal is heavily reliant on a few large customers 
the company is one of three major independent global competitors in the highly competitive leaf tobacco industry  all of whom are reliant upon a few large customers 
the loss of one of those large customers or a significant decrease in their respective demand for the company s products or services could further increase competition and significantly decrease the company s sales of products or services  which would have a material adverse effect on universal s results of operations 
the competition among leaf tobacco merchants is based on the ability to meet customer specifications in the buying  processing  and financing of tobacco  as well as the price charged for products and services 
however  because universal  like its competitors  relies upon a few significant customers  the consolidation or failure of any of these large or significant customers could contribute to a significant decrease in its sales of products and services 
the company s financial results can be significantly affected by the changes in the balance of supply and demand for leaf tobacco or other agricultural products 
because universal is a tobacco leaf merchant  its financial results can be significantly affected by changes in the overall balance of worldwide supply and demand for leaf tobacco 
the demand for tobacco  which is based upon customers expectations of their future tobacco requirements  can change from time to time depending upon internal and external factors affecting the demand for their products 
the company s customers expectations  and thus their demand for leaf tobacco  is influenced by a number of factors  including trends in the global consumption of cigarettes  such as the growth or decline in popularity of american blend cigarettes  and health concerns  trends in sales of cigars and other tobacco products  and levels of competition 
the total supply of tobacco at any given time is a function of current tobacco production and the volumes of uncommitted stocks of processed tobacco from prior years production 
production of tobacco in a given year may be significantly affected by such factors as the amount of tobacco planted by farmers throughout the world  weather fluctuations  and crop disease 
any significant change in these factors could cause a material imbalance in the supply and demand for tobacco  which would affect the company s results of operations 
similar factors can affect results for its agri products businesses 
in areas where universal purchases its leaf tobacco directly from farmers  the company bears therisk that the tobacco it receives will not meet quality and quantity requirements 
in a number of countries where universal contracts directly with tobacco farmers  including argentina  brazil  guatemala  hungary  italy  mozambique  mexico  tanzania  the united states  and zambia  the company bears the risk that the tobacco delivered will not meet quality and quantity requirements 
if the tobacco does not meet such market requirements  the company may not be able to meet all of its customers orders  which would have an adverse effect on its profitability and its results of operations 
in us markets  the high price of us tobacco magnifies the risk of purchasing tobacco that does not meet those requirements 
in addition  in many foreign countries  when universal purchases tobacco directly from farmers  it provides them with financing 
unless the company receives marketable tobacco that meets the quality and quantity specifications of its customers  it bears the risk that it will not be able to fully recover its crop advances or recover them in a reasonable period of time 
the company also has dark leaf tobacco growing operations in indonesia and brazil  where it has similar financing risks 
although the company purchases a portion of its leaf tobacco through public auction  as well as privately negotiated contract purchases  several countries where auction markets are used today may be moving toward direct purchasing  thus increasing the areas subject to this risk 
weather and other conditions can affect the marketability of the company s products 
tobacco and many other agricultural crops that the company buys  such as sunflower seeds and tea  are subject to vagaries of the weather and the environment that can  in some cases  change the quality or size of the crops 
if a weather event is particularly severe  such as a major drought or hurricane  the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to manufacturers  which would result in a reduction in revenues 
if such an event is also widespread  it could affect the company s ability to acquire the quantity of products required by its customers 
in addition  other items can affect the marketability of tobacco and other agricultural products  including  among other things the presence of foreign matter  genetically modified organisms  and excess residues of pesticides  fungicides  and herbicides 
a significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the crops that universal buys could make it difficult for the company to sell these products or to fill customers orders 
because the company is heavily reliant on the home improvement and construction markets in the netherlands to sell lumber and building products  a significant slowdown in those markets could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
the majority of the customers who purchase lumber and building products from universal are located in the netherlands 
therefore  a significant slowdown in the home improvement or construction market in the netherlands could reduce demand for these products  which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
regulatory and governmental factors government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption could have a significant impact on the businesses of universal s customers  which would  in turn  affect the company s results of operations 
the us federal government and certain state and local governments have taken or proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing us consumption of tobacco products and indirectly reducing demand for the company s products and services 
these activities have included the us environmental protection agency s decision to classify environmental tobacco smoke as a group a known human carcinogen  restrictions on the use of tobacco products in public places and places of employment  proposals to have the us food and drug administration  or fda  regulate nicotine as a drug and sharply restrict cigarette advertising and promotion  proposals to increase the federal and state excise taxes on cigarettes  and the policy of the us government to link certain federal grants to the enforcement of state laws restricting the sale of tobacco products 
numerous other legislative and regulatory anti smoking measures have been proposed at the federal  state  and local levels 
excluding the effect of tobacco contained in cigarettes imported into the united states  the company estimates that between and of the flue cured and burley tobaccos that it handles worldwide is ultimately consumed in the united states 
universal s tobacco sales consist primarily of the flue cured and burley tobaccos  which  along with oriental tobaccos  are the major ingredients in american blend cigarettes 
in addition  a number of foreign governments have also taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion  to increase taxes on cigarettes  and to discourage cigarette consumption 
a number of such measures are included in the recently adopted framework treaty on tobacco control  which was negotiated under the auspices of the world health organization 
in some cases  such restrictions are more onerous than those proposed or in effect in the united states 
the company cannot predict the extent to which government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of its primary customers 
however  a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for the company s products and services and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
because universal conducts a significant portion of its operations internationally  political uncertainties in certain countries could have an adverse effect on its performance and results of operations 
the company s international operations are subject to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments  principally in developing countries and emerging markets  and to the effects of changes in the trade policies and economic regulations of foreign governments 
these uncertainties and risks  which include  among other factors  undeveloped or antiquated commercial law and the expropriation or nationalization of assets  may adversely impact the company s ability to effectively manage its operations in those countries 
for example  in the past  universal has experienced significant year to year fluctuations in earnings due to changes in the brazilian government s economic policies  and government actions in zimbabwe have reduced the tobacco crop there  causing the company to shift sourcing of tobacco to other countries 
universal has substantial capital investments in south america and africa  and the performance of its operations in these regions can materially affect its earnings from tobacco operations 
if the political situation in any of the countries where the company conducts business were to deteriorate significantly  the company s ability to recover assets located there could be impaired 
to the extent that universal could not replace any lost volumes of tobacco with tobacco from other sources  or that the company incurs increased costs related to such replacement  its results of operations would suffer 
financial factors failure of universal s customers or farmers to repay extensions of credit could materially impact the company s results of operations 
universal extends credit to both farmers and its customers 
a significant delay in payment or a significant bad debt provision related to amounts due to the company could adversely affect its results of operations 
in addition  crop advances to farmers are generally secured by the farmers agreement to deliver green tobacco 
in the event of crop failure  recovery of advances could be delayed until future crops are delivered 
failure of foreign banks in which universal s subsidiaries deposit funds or the failure to transfer funds or honor withdrawals may affect its results of operations 
funds held by the company s foreign subsidiaries are often deposited in their local banks 
in certain circumstances  the company s ability to gain access to these funds could be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on universal s results of operations 
banks in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to a higher rate of failure or may not honor withdrawals of deposited funds 
in addition  the countries in which these local banks operate may lack sufficient regulatory oversight or suffer from structural weaknesses in the local banking system 
due to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments  these local banks also may be subject to exchange controls and therefore unable to perform transfers of certain currencies 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may affect universal s results of operations 
although the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs and overhead in the source country  the company s purchases of tobacco are often made in local currency 
as a result  changes in local currency can make a particular crop more or less attractive in the world market thereby affecting the profitability of such crop and universal s results of operations 
because there is no forward foreign exchange market in many of the major countries where the company sources tobacco  universal manages its foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale and by minimizing its net investment in these countries 
to the extent that the company is not able to continue match funding  or otherwise hedge its exposure  the company could have a disproportionate exposure to local currency in which the tobacco was purchased 
certain of the company s operations use their local currency as the functional currency 
for example  the lumber and building products operations  which are based in the netherlands  use the euro as their functional currency 
in certain tobacco markets that are primarily domestic  the company uses the local currency as the functional currency 
examples of these domestic markets are hungary and poland 
in each case  reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the us dollar 
see also qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
in universal s tobacco business  customers usually pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased on order 
because of changes in financial markets  the company  like many others  has moved away from short term credit markets 
the company is borrowing more long term debt  and  through hedging agreements  it is swapping the interest rates on its existing fixed rate debt to floating market interest rates to better match the interest rates that the company charges its customers 
to the extent universal is unable to match these interest rates  a decrease in interest rates could increase its net financing costs 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rates interest rate risk is limited in the tobacco business because customers usually pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased for their accounts 
the company s tobacco customers pay interest on tobacco purchased for their order 
that interest is paid at rates based on current markets for variable rate debt 
if universal funds its committed tobacco inventory with fixed rate debt  the company may not be able to recover interest at that fixed rate if current market interest rates fall 
as of june   tobacco inventory of million included million in inventory that was committed for sale to customers and million that was not committed 
committed inventory  after deducting million in customer deposits  represents the company s net exposure of million 
to manage that interest rate risk  universal maintains a substantial portion of its debt at variable interest rates either directly or through interest rate exchange agreements 
debt carried at variable interest rates either on its face or through derivative instruments was million  in order to substantially mitigate interest rate risk related to carrying fixed rate debt 
of the million in variable rate debt  million represented hedges of fixed rate debt in which universal receives fixed rate payments and pays variable rate payments based on libor 
although a hypothetical change in short term interest rates would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately million  about two thirds of that amount could be offset with changes in charges to customers 
currency the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs and overhead in the source country 
most of the operations are accounted for using the us dollar as the functional currency 
because there is no forward foreign exchange market in many of universal s major countries of tobacco origin  the company manages its foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale  which is usually the us dollar  and by minimizing its net investment in individual countries 
in these countries  the company is vulnerable to currency gains and losses to the extent that any local currency balances do not offset each other 
the company recognized a million exchange gain due to remeasurement in  and recorded remeasurement losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the consolidated million gain in fiscal year included a million gain generated on remeasurement of local currency liabilities after export rates were adjusted in africa 
recognized exchange losses in   and resulting from foreign currency transactions were thousand  million  and million  respectively 
the lumber and building products operations  which are based in the netherlands  use the euro as their functional currency 
in certain tobacco markets that are primarily domestic  the company uses the local currency as the functional currency 
examples of these domestic markets are hungary and poland 
in each case  reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the us dollar 
commodity universal uses commodity futures in its rubber trading business to reduce the risk of price fluctuations 
the company does not enter into rubber contracts for trading purposes 
all forward commodity contracts are adjusted to fair market value during the year  and gains and losses are recorded in income at that time 
the amounts recorded during   and were not material 
derivatives policies hedging interest rate exposure using swaps and hedging foreign exchange exposure using forward contracts are specifically contemplated to manage risk in keeping with management s policies 
universal may use derivative instruments  such as swaps  forwards  or futures  which are based directly or indirectly upon interest rates  currencies  and commodities  to manage and reduce the risks inherent in interest rate  currency  and price fluctuations 
the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes  and it does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
derivatives are transaction specific so that a specific debt instrument  contract  or invoice determines the amount  maturity  and other specifics of the hedge 
counter party risk is limited to institutions with long term debt ratings of a or better
