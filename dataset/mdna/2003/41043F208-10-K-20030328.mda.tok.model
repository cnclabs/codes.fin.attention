item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated forward looking statements 
we are the largest operator and developer of orthotic and prosthetic o p patient care centers in the united states 
orthotics is the design  fabrication  fitting and device maintenance of custom made braces and other devices such as spinal  knee and sports medicine braces that provide external support to treat musculoskeletal disorders 
musculoskeletal disorders are ailments of the back  extremities or joints caused by traumatic injuries  chronic conditions  diseases  congenital disorders or injuries resulting from sports or other activities 
prosthetics is the design  fabrication and fitting of custom made artificial limbs for patients who have lost limbs as a result of traumatic injuries  vascular diseases  diabetes  cancer or congenital disorders 
we have two segments  the o p patient care services segment  which generated approximately of our sales in  and the distribution of o p components segment  which accounted for of our sales 
our operations are located in states and the district of columbia  with a substantial presence in california  florida  georgia  illinois  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
we generate sales primarily from patient care services related to the fabrication  fitting and maintenance of o p devices 
during  same center sales increased by over same center sales growth represents the aggregate increase or decrease of our patient care centers sales in the current year compared to the preceding year 
patient care centers that have been owned by the company for at least one full year are included in the computation 
the sales related to patient care centers that have been sold are not included in the calculation for the current and preceding years 
our sales growth in was also principally driven by same center sales growth 
prior to calendar  our growth in sales resulted primarily from an aggressive program of acquiring and developing o p patient care centers and secondarily from same center sales 
we acquired six additional patient care centers in october  and one additional patient care center in december  we operated and patient care centers at december  and  respectively and three distribution facilities at both december  and the decrease in patient care centers was primarily due to the planned closure or merger of existing facilities 
we calculate cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method 
we base the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors affecting cost of goods sold 
estimated cost of goods sold is adjusted when the annual physical inventory is taken and compiled  generally in the fourth quarter  and a new accrual rate is established 
our revenues and results of operations are affected by seasonal considerations 
the adverse weather conditions often experienced in certain geographical areas of the united states during the first quarter of each year  together with a greater degree of patients sole responsibility for their insurance deductible payment obligations during the beginning of each calendar year  have contributed to lower net sales in the first quarter 
we believe that the expansion of our business through a combination of continued same center sales growth  which has averaged over the last three years  the addition of new facilities and a program of selective acquisitions is critical to the continued improvement in our profitability

as of december   the planned reduction in work force had been completed and we closed all patient care centers that were identified for closure in during the year ended december   management reversed million of the lease termination restructuring reserve as a result of favorable lease buyouts and subleasing activity 
the remaining lease payments on these closed patient care centers are expected to be paid through in december  our management and the board of directors determined that additional performance improvement initiatives needed to be adopted 
we retained ja a to do an assessment of the opportunities available for improved financial and operating performance 
the first phase of the plan called for the termination of employees  for which we recorded million in severance costs during in january  we developed  with the assistance of ja a  a comprehensive performance improvement program consisting of performance improvement initiatives aimed at improving cash collections  reducing working capital requirements and improving operating performance 
in connection with these initiatives  we recorded million in restructuring and asset impairment costs 
these initiatives called for the closure of additional patient care centers and the termination of additional employees 
during  the lease restructuring component of the plan was amended as seven additional properties  which were originally contemplated but not finalized  were added to the list of restructured facilities 
as of december   all of the contemplated employee terminations and property closures have taken place 
all payments have been made under the severance initiative and all payments under the lease initiative are expected to be paid by december  performance improvement costs in  we recorded million in cash and non cash charges associated with performance improvement initiatives 
these charges were comprised of million in fees and costs  primarily related to payments of million made to ja a for consulting and success fees  and a million non cash charge related to stock compensation paid ja a for their services 
impairment loss on assets held for sale in connection with the analysis of our continuing business  we determined that the manufacture of orthotic and prosthetic components and devices was not one of our core businesses as it represented only of our net sales for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  in july  we agreed to the general terms of a sale of substantially all of the manufacturing assets of sogi to united states manufacturing company  llc for million 
the sale resulted in our recording  in the second quarter of  an asset impairment loss of million  as the net book value of the assets was million  while net proceeds from the sale of the assets were million 
performance improvement plan in january  we developed  with the assistance of our consultant  ja a  a performance improvement plan which contained many initiatives that were designed to effect cost savings through improved utilization and efficiency of support services  enhanced purchasing and inventory management  improved collection methods and consolidation of distribution services 
in addition  we sought to enhance net sales through improved marketing and branding initiatives and more efficient billing procedures 
during  these initiatives have become part of our normal operations and the savings associated with their implementation are reflected in our financial performance 
these and other new initiatives related to accounts receivable  material and labor efficiencies  and information systems continue to be evaluated and implemented to improve our operations and financial position 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  the million increase in working capital was attributable principally to the refinancing of our bank debt in february  which reduced the current portion of our then existing long term debt 
our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million at december  and million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   compared to to at december  availability under our revolving line of credit increased to million at december  compared to million at december   due both to the effect of the february refinancing and principal repayments out of cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million provided by operating activities for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital due principally to an million income tax receivable that we expect to receive in the second quarter of net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   versus net cash provided by investing activities of million in the prior year 
the change in net cash used was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain assets  including sogi  which provided a million benefit in net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  the cash was used principally to make payments against our revolving line of credit and scheduled payments of seller notes 
on february   we received million in proceeds from the sale of the senior notes due senior notes in a private placement exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture  dated as of february   with wilmington trust company  as trustee 
we also closed  concurrent with the sale of senior notes  a new million senior secured revolving line of credit new revolving credit facility 
the proceeds from the sale of senior notes and the new revolving credit facility were offset by i principal payments of million to retire our tranche a b term facilities  ii a net paydown of million of our prior revolving line of credit  and iii payment of million in financing costs related to the issuance of the senior notes and the establishment of the new revolving credit facility 
in addition to the aforementioned proceeds  we received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by i payment of approximately million to ja a to repurchase  shares underlying an outstanding option to purchase shares of our common stock  as discussed below  ii scheduled principal payments of million on our long term debt  iii an additional net pay down of million of our new revolving credit facility and iv an additional payment of million in financing costs related to the issuance of the senior notes and the establishment of the new revolving credit facility 
the senior notes mature on february  and do not require any prepayments of principal prior to maturity 
interest on the senior notes accrues from february   and is payable semi annually on february and august of each year  commencing august  payment of principal and interest on the senior notes is guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our current and future domestic subsidiaries 
on and after february   we may redeem all or part of the senior notes at of principal amount during the month period commencing on february   at of principal amount if redeemed during the month period commencing on february   and at of principal amount if redeemed on or after february  before february   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof  plus interest  with the cash proceeds of certain equity offerings  provided that at least of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes remains outstanding after the redemption 
upon the occurrence of certain specified change of control events  unless we have exercised our option to redeem all the senior notes and senior subordinated notes as described above  each holder of a senior note will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
the terms of the senior notes  senior subordinated notes  and the new revolving credit facility limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends on or redeem capital stock  make certain investments  make restricted payments  make certain dispositions of assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in certain business activities and engage in mergers  consolidations and certain sales of assets 
on may   we commenced an offer to exchange the privately placed  unregistered senior notes with new senior notes that had been registered under the securities act of  as amended  on our registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the exchange offer expired on june  all of the previously issued unregistered senior notes were exchanged for registered senior notes 
the new notes are substantially identical to the previously issued unregistered notes except that the new notes are free of the transfer restrictions that applied to the unregistered notes 
the new revolving credit facility  which was provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led by bnp paribas  is a senior secured revolving credit facility providing for loans of up to million and will terminate on february  borrowings under the new revolving credit facility will bear interest  at our option  at an annual rate equal to libor plus a variable margin rate or the base rate as defined in the new revolving credit facility plus a variable margin rate 
in each case  the variable margin rate is subject to adjustments based on financial performance 
at december   the interest rates have been adjusted to libor plus or the base rate plus 
our obligations under the new revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in our subsidiaries shares  all of our assets and all of the assets of our subsidiaries 
we can prepay borrowings under the new revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty 
the new revolving credit facility requires compliance with various financial covenants  including a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  minimum consolidated ebitda  a maximum total leverage ratio  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as well as other covenants 
ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and unusual charges consisting of impairment loss on assets held for sale  and integration  impairment  restructuring  and performance improvement costs 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
ebitda is not a measure of performance under gaap 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  our compliance with these covenants and monitor any matters critical to continue our compliance 
the new revolving credit facility contains customary events of default and is subject to various mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions 
during the fourth quarter of  we approved for payment two invoices from ja a for success fees 
in accordance with our contract with ja a  the invoices were satisfied by the payment of million in cash and the issuance of a nonqualified option to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the option was valued using a black scholes option pricing model  and an expense of million was recorded 
on july   we agreed to repurchase  of the shares underlying such previously granted option for a payment of per share  or a total of million  which was paid during the third quarter of and recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital 
on july   our common stock opened for trading at per share 
in accordance with our agreement with ja a  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to register the remaining  shares underlying the outstanding option in order to permit ja a to sell the shares of our stock that it may acquire upon exercise of the option 
ja a also agreed to permanently amend its contract with us so that the payment of future success fees  if any  would be made only in cash 
we concluded our relationship with ja a in without the payment of any additional success fees 
we believe that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash generated from operations  together with other available sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under the new revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund anticipated capital expenditures and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt  including payments due on the senior notes and obligations under the new revolving credit facility 
in addition  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and expect to fund such acquisitions from our available sources of liquidity  as discussed above 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period s total thereafter long term debt      interest on long term debt        redeemable preferred stock   operating leases        unconditional purchase commitments      other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations        we entered into a supply agreement with usmc  under which we agreed to purchase certain products and components for use solely by our patient care centers during a five year period following the date of the agreement 
selected operating data the following table sets forth selected operating data as of the end of the years indicated patient care centers certified practitioners number of states including dc same center net sales growth represents the aggregate increase or decrease of our patient care centers sales in the current year compared to the preceding year 
market risk we are exposed to the market risk that is associated with changes in interest rates 
to manage that risk  in march  we entered into interest rate swaps to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce borrowing costs 
we entered into million fixed to floating interest rate swaps  consisting of floating rate instruments benchmarked to libor 
we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the swap agreements 
critical accounting estimates our analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
us gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we have chosen accounting policies within us gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note b to the consolidated financial statements as presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
o revenue recognition revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices and associated services to patients are recorded when the device is accepted by the patient 
revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices to customers by our distribution segment are recorded upon the shipment of products  in accordance with the terms of the invoice 
revenue is recorded at its net realizable value taking into consideration all governmental and contractual adjustments and discounts 
deferred revenue represents both deposits made prior to the final fitting and acceptance by the patient and unearned service contract revenue 
subsequent to billing for our devices and services  disallowed sales may result if there are problems with pre authorization or with other insurance coverage issues with third party payors 
if these problems occur  they are recognized as reductions in sales 
other revenue may be uncollectible  even if properly pre authorized and billed 
in the cases when valid revenue cannot be collected  a bad debt expense is recognized 
in addition to the actual bad debt expense encountered during collection activities  we estimate the amount of potential bad debt expense that may occur in the future as we collect our receivables 
this estimate is based upon our historical experience as well as a detailed review of our receivable balances 
o inventories inventories  which consist principally of purchased parts and work in process  are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we calculate cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method 
we base the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors affecting cost of goods sold during the current reporting periods 
estimated cost of goods sold during the period is adjusted when the annual physical inventory is taken 
in and  unfavorable and favorable respectively adjustments were made in the fourth quarter as a result of completing the physical inventory 
in  virtually no adjustment was required in the fourth quarter as we were more accurately estimating our cost of goods sold throughout the year 
management adjusts our reserve for inventory obsolescence whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying cost of certain inventory items is in excess of its market price 
o intangible assets excess cost over net assets acquired goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to net identifiable assets of purchased businesses 
the assembled workforce intangibles meet the criteria of indefinite lived intangibles which  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 have been reclassified as goodwill and are no longer being amortized as of january  we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  annually as required by sfas no 
any impairment would be recognized by a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
we completed the annual impairment test as of october   which did not result in the impairment of goodwill 
this assessment included assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
non compete agreements are recorded based on agreements entered into by us and are amortized over their terms ranging from to years using the straight line method 
other definite lived intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to years using the straight line method 
whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these intangibles may not be recoverable  management reviews and assesses the future cash flows expected to be generated from the related intangible for possible impairment 
any impairment would be recognized as a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
o deferred tax assets liabilities we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial accounting purposes than for income tax purposes 
deferred income taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
we recognize  in accordance with sfas no 
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not the assets will be realized in future years 
new accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  and changes the criteria that have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale  and redefines the reporting of discontinued operations 
we adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january  there was no material effect upon adoption of this statement 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

under sfas no 
 gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt will no longer be extraordinary items  unless they satisfied the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb where extraordinary items are stated to be distinguishable by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of their occurrence 
any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified 
in addition  under sfas no 
 certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  sfas no 
was adopted by us on january  and will result in a reclassification of existing extraordinary losses on the early extinguishment of debt from an extraordinary item to a non operating item 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

under sfas no 
 costs associated with exit or disposal activities would be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
such costs would include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we continue to use the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as prescribed by apb opinion no 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by this standard at december  in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
as of december  the adoption had no material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that  upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the recognition provisions of fin are effective for any guarantees that are issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements will be effective for our quarter ended march  management believes the adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations  as increased costs to us generally have been offset by increased prices of products sold 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have existing obligations relating to our senior notes  senior subordinated notes due  subordinated seller notes  and redeemable preferred stock 
we do not have cash flow exposure to changing interest rates on these obligations because the interest and dividend rates of these securities are fixed 
however  as discussed below  we entered into two fixed to floating interest rate swaps  in connection with the sale of our senior notes  whereby the aggregate notional amount of the swaps equaled one half  or million  of the principal amount of the senior notes 
we have a million revolving line of credit  with an outstanding balance of million at december   as discussed in note h to our consolidated financial statements 
the rates at which interest accrues under the entire outstanding balance are variable 
in addition  in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
we address this risk by using interest rate swaps from time to time 
at december  there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 
in march  we entered into two fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million in connection with the sale of our senior notes  as discussed in note h 
variable rate debt and fixed to floating interest rate swaps subject us to cash flow exposure resulting from changing interest rates  as illustrated in the table below 
presented below is an analysis of our financial instruments as of december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
