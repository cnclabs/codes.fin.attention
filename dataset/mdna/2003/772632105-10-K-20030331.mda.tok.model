item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general rock of ages is an integrated quarrier  manufacturer  distributor and retailer of granite and products manufactured from granite 
the company also owns and operates cemeteries 
the quarry division sells granite blocks both to the manufacturing division and to outside manufacturers  as well as to customers in europe and japan 
the manufacturing division s principal product is granite memorials used primarily in cemeteries  although it also manufactures some specialized granite products for industrial applications 
the retail division primarily sells granite memorials directly to consumers 
the cemetery division sells cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
during the year ended december   the company acquired retail monument companies  thereby expanding its retail presence to locations in georgia  iowa  illinois  minnesota  nebraska  new jersey  pennsylvania  ohio and south dakota 
during the year ended december   the company acquired an additional retail monument companies and in so doing strengthened its existing retail presence in certain states while expanding its retail presence in connecticut  rhode island  massachusetts and wisconsin 
in  the company acquired memorial retailers in separate and independent transactions  thereby acquiring retail sales outlets in the states of connecticut and iowa 
the company also acquired cemetery properties and memorial retailer located in the state of kentucky as of january  the company paid a total aggregate purchase price in the acquisitions of approximately  all of which was paid in cash  and approximately million for the kentucky cemeteries and retailer acquired in january  million of which was paid in cash with the remainder payable in installments through during the second quarter of the company sold an idled saw plant in barre  vermont in which cash of  was received in exchange for assets with the carrying value of  during the third quarter of the company completed the sale of smi and childs childs manufacturing plants and the royalty and millstone quarries in elberton  georgia in which total cash of  net of closing costs of  was received and notes receivable were recorded for a total of  in exchange for assets with the carrying value of  during the first quarter of  the company completed the sale of the lawson manufacturing plant in barre  vermont for  of which  in cash and  in a note receivable was received in exchange for  of assets 
this sale is consistent with the company s desire to dispose of certain unprofitable operations and to reallocate resources from the manufacture of commodity memorials and focus on its retail strategy 
the loss on sale of assets reported for the year ending december   includes a non tax deductible disposal of intangible assets of approximately million 
taxable income resulted from the sale of the inventory and property and equipment  the impact of which was recorded in the three month ended september  the sale of these assets is not expected to have any material effect on income taxes in future periods 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of deferred income taxes and accounting for pensions 
revenue recognition the manufacturing division recognizes revenue upon shipment of finished orders from the manufacturing plant 
the retailing division recognizes revenue upon the setting of the memorial in the cemetery 
in certain instances  the company may enter into an agreement with a customer  which provides for extended payment terms  generally up to two years from either the date of setting of the memorial or  in certain instances  upon the settlement of an estate 
the quarry division recognizes revenue from sales of granite blocks when the granite is shipped or when the customer selects and identifies the blocks at the quarry site and the customer requests the company to store the block 
at that time  the block is removed from the company s inventory  the customer s name is printed on the block  and title and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
in many cases  granite blocks owned by customers remain on the company s property for varying periods of time after title passes to the buyer 
payment terms are less days  net days  except the december terms described below 
sales of the company s blocks are fob quarry and the company retains the obligation to load customer s blocks on trucks 
at its barre  vermont location  sales are fob barre  vermont and the company retains a delivery obligation using the company s trucks for block customers in barre 
the customer may take delivery at any time determined by the customer  but all invoices must be paid in accordance with their terms when due whether or not the customer requests delivery 
the company considers the earnings process substantially complete despite the company s obligations to load the blocks  and  in the case of its barre customers  deliver the blocks  because the cost of delivery service is inconsequential less than in relation to the selling price 
further  under industry terms of trade  title passes and the payment obligation is established when the block is identified to a particular customer and transaction 
in december each year  the company provides special day payment terms at its barre quarries for all block purchased in the month of december 
the reason for this is that the barre quarries are generally closed from mid december through mid march because of weather 
however  the quarry customers manufacturing plants remain open during most of this period  and most prefer to assure they own blocks of a size and quality selected by them prior to the quarries closure 
all blocks purchased in december on deferred payment terms are invoiced on or about december and removed from the company s inventory with title passing to the buyer 
payment terms are one third of the invoice amount on january  one third on february  and one third on march the program provides essentially the normal day payment terms during the months when the quarry is closed notwithstanding the customer s purchase of a three months supply in december 
customers need not use these terms and may buy from inventory during the closure period on a first come  first served basis with normal day terms 
the cemetery division s revenue from preneed sales of funeral services  and cemetery services and merchandise is deferred until the period in which the services or merchandise is delivered 
on the balance sheet the full contract amount is included in prearranged deferred revenue  a liability 
the corresponding receivable due from the customer is reflected in prearranged receivables  an asset  and the corresponding cash received from the customer is reflected part in prearranged receivables for the portion placed in trust and part in cash for the portion the company is allowed to retain 
indirect costs of marketing are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
when the service or merchandise is delivered  the company recognizes as revenue the full contract amount plus all trust earnings associated with that contract 
the company cannot predict when the existing contracts will mature but it is estimated that most contracts will have an average life of ten to fifteen years and in some cases greater than fifteen years 
the amount of prearranged deferred revenue at december  was impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and  prior to  goodwill 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or change in utilization of property and equipment 
recoverability of property and equipment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale at the end of its depreciation period 
estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our services  sustainability of gross margins  and our ability to integrate acquired companies and achieve economies of scale 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
effective january   the company assessed impairment of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step test be performed 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit will be compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
the company determined the fair value of each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
this evaluation indicated that goodwill recorded in the retail and cemetery segments was impaired as of january  as a result  the company completed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
accordingly  the company recognized a million non cash charge  recorded as of january   as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write down of goodwill to its fair value 
approximately million of the goodwill write down is deductible for taxes  therefore a deferred tax asset of million has been recorded 
conditions that contributed to the goodwill impairment in retail were an underestimation of the amount of time required to fully integrate the branding strategy through the retail network and the difficulty in increasing profitability in the timeframe expected and to the extent anticipated prior to the retail acquisitions 
conditions that contributed to the goodwill impairment in cemeteries were lower than expected revenues and greater selling and administrative costs  which the company believes are  to some extent  temporary but are significant enough to affect the fair value determination 
valuation of deferred income taxes as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets of  in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependant upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management has recorded a valuation allowance of  against the alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards and other deferred tax assets 
based upon the projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of these unreserved net deferred tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
accounting for pensions the company provides defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain of its employees 
accounting for these plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions including estimates on the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rates 
in order to make informed assumptions management relies on outside actuarial experts as well as public market data and general economic information 
if changes in any of these assumptions occur  they may materially affect certain amounts reported on the company s balance sheet 
in particular  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets could result in an increase in the company s pension liability and a charge to equity 
the following table sets forth certain historical statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues with the exception of quarrying  manufacturing and retailing gross profit  which are shown as a percentage of quarrying  manufacturing and retailing revenues  respectively

manufacturing revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was a result of the sale of childs in  a decrease in the number of independent authorized retailers  and a decrease in sales in our industrial products division as a result of decreased demand for those products due to the current general economic slowdown 
these decreases were partially offset by revenue recognized on a large memorial for world war ii  increased shipments of mausoleums and other feature memorials 
while the company expects a decrease in revenue as a result of the loss in customer base associated with the sale of lawson in january  it expects that this decrease will be partially offset by an increase in revenues and percent of branded sales from its remaining customer base 
retailing revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  over the past years  the company s retail order receipts have averaged approximately million per year 
in  the company decreased its backlog of orders by approximately million resulting in revenues in excess of the average annual order receipts 
the decrease in revenue in is a result of insufficient order receipts from the company s retail outlets that would have been required to maintain the prior year s level due in part to the closure of certain unprofitable stores in the latter part of and in cemetery revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase results principally from of the recognition of approximately  in revenue in from the completion of a large project that was pre sold as well as increased sales of lots and at need markers  which we believe resulted from increased sales staff 
the completion and subsequent recognition of revenue on projects that are pre sold is common in the industry but not expected to be a consistent part of our revenues in future periods 
gross profit dollars for the fiscal year ended december  decreased to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal quarrying gross profit was million or of quarrying revenue for the year ended december  compared to million or of quarrying revenue for the year ended december  during  the company elected to change the method of valuing inventory in the quarry division from a first in  first out method to a specific annual average cost method 
the effect of the change in was to decrease operating income by  the company believes the specific annual average cost method more accurately matches costs with revenue  resulting in an enhanced measurement of operating results 
see note of the financial statements 
the increase in gross profit dollars was attributable to an increase in revenue  an increase in yields at the bethel white  pennsylvania black  and gardenia white quarries as well as a decrease in the amount of profit transferred to the manufacturing division as a result of lower sales to that division 
the slight decrease in gross margin percentage was a result of decreased quarry yields and higher repair and maintenance costs in the barre gray quarry  which was almost entirely offset by an increase in gross margin percentage at the pennsylvania black and gardenia white quarries 
manufacturing gross profit was million or of manufacturing revenue for the year ended december  compared to million or of manufacturing revenue for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin percentage is a result of improved operations in our barre manufacturing facility as well as a more favorable product mix in this facility compared to the same period in the sale of lawson  which was completed in january  also had a positive effect on gross margins due to the elimination of traditionally low margin customers and a strong focus on the company s core authorized dealer network resulting in increased branded sales  which have historically had higher gross margins than unbranded sales 
in connection with the lawson sale  the company entered into a seven year contract to purchase memorials from the new owner 
although there are many alternative suppliers of granite memorials  the company is dependent on this arrangement to provide product to its customers and believes it will continue to be favorable for the company 
retailing gross profit was million or of retailing revenue for the year ended december  compared to million or of retailing revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in dollars and percentage was attributable to the lower revenues in and an associated decrease in operational efficiencies 
cemetery gross profit was million or of cemetery revenue for the year ended december  compared to  or of cemetery revenue for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin percentage is a result of improved operations as the company continues to implement strategies to achieve a stronger sales force and cut or maintain costs in the groundskeeping and maintenance operations 
in addition  the company recognized approximately  in gross margin from the completion of a large project that was pre sold as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  these expenses for decreased slightly to from 
the decrease is a result of lower commission expense in the retail segment as well as a decrease in sg a in the company s manufacturing group due principally to the sale of the lawson plant 
these decreases were offset by increased legal expenses in the quarry segment as a result of the eurimex arbitration proceeding see item legal proceedings and an increase in corporate administrative expenses related  in part  to a one time severance payment to a former company officer 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  decreased to  from million for the fiscal year ended december  this decrease was due to lower interest rates under the company s credit facilities as well as a reduction in debt funded by cash from operations and from the proceeds of the sale of smi  childs  the royalty quarries royalty and lawson 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before taxes decreased to in from in the high rate in was the result of the disposition of the quarrying and manufacturing assets for which the write down of goodwill was non deductible for tax purposes 
the tax rate is consistent with the company s historical rate 
the cumulative effect in prior years of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december  was a loss of million compared to for the loss consisted primarily of a write down of million in goodwill net of tax benefit of million as a result of adopting sfas as well as a change in accounting method for quarry inventory  which resulted in a  write down of inventory net of tax benefit of

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  quarrying revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was largely due to strong customer demand for bethel and gardenia white granite and increased revenues from the salisbury quarry as a result of the company implementing its direct to the customer sales model 
manufacturing revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to poor shipments in the first quarter of as a result of difficult weather conditions  a decrease in the number of independent authorized retailers  and a decrease in demand for the company s industrial products that are sold to the high tech industry due to a general softening in that business sector 
the company s sale of childs and smi  which were completed in  and the sale of lawson  which was completed in january  were consistent with the company s desire to focus on the manufacture of branded memorials for its authorized retail network and its owned retail stores 
retailing revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was a result of additional branded sales at the retail locations and favorable seasonal factors in which allowed for those retailers affected by weather to have greater cemetery settings in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in cemetery revenues were million for the year ended december  the company acquired the cemeteries in january and had no comparable data for gross profit dollars for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  consolidated gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal from in fiscal quarrying gross profit was million or of revenue for the year ended december  compared to million or of quarrying revenue for the year ended december  the increase was principally due to increased operational efficiencies at the bethel quarry and an increase in reported revenue at the salisbury quarry as a result of the company terminating the distribution agreement with eurimex 
see item legal proceedings 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit at the pennsylvania black quarry due to short term higher than anticipated quarry development costs 
manufacturing gross profit was million or of manufacturing revenue for the year ended december  compared to million or of manufacturing revenue for the year ended december  the decline in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the decreased revenues discussed above as well as a decrease in profitability in the industrial products business due to a general softening in the technology business sector

selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  these expenses for increased to from 
this increase is a result of additional legal expenses in the quarry segment as a result of the eurimex arbitration proceedings and the higher selling expenses associated with the cemetery segment that the company acquired in january interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  decreased to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  this decrease was due to lower interest rates under the company s credit facilities as well as a reduction in debt funded by cash from operations and from the proceeds of the sale of smi  childs and royalty 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before taxes increased to in from in this increase was a result of the disposition of the quarrying and manufacturing assets for which the write down of goodwill was non deductible for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the company considers its liquidity to be adequate to meet its long and short term cash requirements to fund operations and pursue its growth strategy 
historically  the company has met these requirements primarily from cash generated by operating activities and periodic borrowings under the commercial credit facilities described below 
the company anticipates that there may be future acquisitions  as it pursues its growth strategy that may require external financing from our existing credit facility 
in january  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for a total of  as part of its share buy back program 
upon completion of this transaction  the company has repurchased a total of  shares for  under the share buy back program 
there remains  shares authorized to be purchased under the current repurchase program 
the company will continue to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis determined by  among other things  current debt levels  anticipated uses of capital  the price of the stock and the general market conditions 
as a result of the accumulated benefit obligations of the company s pension benefit plan exceeding the fair market value of the plans assets  the company has recorded a million minimum liability  through a charge to equity during of million  net of taxes of  this charge is reflected as a reduction to other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  the company made a payment to fund the plan of million in  which was the maximum allowable deductible amount for tax purposes 
based on current market conditions and the related impact on the fair value of plan assets  additional funding of this extent may be warranted in the future and the company believes it will be able to fund such contributions either from cash from operations or borrowing under its credit facilities

seasonality historically  the company s operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally the company s net sales have been highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather 
cemeteries in northern areas generally do not accept granite memorials during winter months when the ground is frozen because they cannot be properly set 
in addition  the company typically closes certain of its vermont and canadian quarries during these months because of increased operating costs attributable to adverse weather conditions 
as a result  the company has historically incurred a net loss during the first three months of each calendar year 
risk factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our continued growth depends  at least in part  on acquisitions  which involve numerous risks that could negatively affect our earnings and financial condition 
our ability to continue to grow depends in part upon the acquisition of additional companies 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  or that we will be able to consummate transactions on acceptable terms 
further  even if we successfully acquire additional companies  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of such companies with our own 
we intend to finance acquisitions through a combination of available cash resources  bank borrowings  and  in appropriate circumstances  the issuance of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional companies will have a significant effect on our financial position  and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
also  acquisitions may result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on the company s financial statements  the write off of which would reduce reported earnings at the point in time the goodwill is deemed impaired 
with respect to retail acquisitions  goodwill impairment could be incurred at the closing of the acquisition 
opening new stores is a component of our growth strategy and entails uncertainties and risks that could adversely affect our profitability 
our ability to continue to grow our retail business will depend in part upon our ability to open new retail stores in selected locations 
our success in opening new retail stores will depend on our ability to identify suitable locations for opening new retail stores on acceptable terms  our ability to attract and retain competent management and sales personnel  and our ability to form strategic alliances and relationships with local funeral homes  cemeteries and other death care professionals  and our ability to attract customers to our new stores 
it is unlikely that new retail stores that we open will generate significant profits in the early stages  and many new stores will lose money for the first few years of operation 
accordingly  opening new retail stores may adversely affect our business or profitability 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with independent retailers  our sales may not continue to grow and could decline 
we have historically sold our granite memorials to consumers through independent retailers 
over the past five years  we have acquired retailers with approximately retail outlets in states 
however  we are still dependent in part on our independent retailers for the successful distribution of our products to the ultimate customer 
we have no control over the independent retailers operations  including such matters as retail price  advertising and marketing 
three important components of our growth strategy are to continue to acquire retailers  open new retail stores in selected markets and pursue strategic alliances with funeral homes  cemetery owners  and other death care professionals 
although we have taken steps to reduce conflicts between our owned retail stores and our independent retailers  the implementation of these elements of our strategy has in the past been  and may in the future be construed by some of our existing independent retailers as an effort to compete with them 
in certain cases  this has adversely affected their relationship with us and caused them to decrease or cease their purchases of our products 
these issues may continue to arise as we pursue our growth strategy 
in addition  the granite memorial retail industry is characterized by significant barriers to entry created by local heritage  community presence and tradition 
consequently  we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty replacing retailers or entering particular retail markets in the event of a loss of an independent retailer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing relationships or establish new relationships with independent retailers 
disruption in our relationships with independent retailers could impede our sales growth or cause sales to decline  which would adversely affect our business and financial results 
if we lose our key personnel  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our operations and the implementation of our operating and growth strategies  such as integration of acquisitions and the opening of new retail stores  are management intensive 
we are substantially dependent upon the abilities and continued efforts of kurt m 
swenson  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other senior management 
our business is also dependent on our ability to continue to attract and retain a highly skilled retail  quarrying and manufacturing workforce  including sales managers and counselors  stone cutters  sand blasters  sculptors and other skilled artisans 
the loss of the services of mr 
swenson  other members of the company s senior management or other highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we face intense competition and  if we are unable to compete successfully  we may be unable to increase our sales  which would adversely affect our business and profitability 
the dimension stone industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with other dimension stone quarriers  including quarriers of granite  marble  limestone  travertine and other natural stones 
the company also competes with manufacturers of so called engineered stone as well as manufacturers of other building materials like concrete  aluminum  glass  wood and other materials 
the company competes with providers of these materials on the basis of price  availability of supply  end user preference for certain colors  patterns or textures  and other factors 
the granite memorial industry is also highly competitive 
the company competes with other granite quarriers and manufacturers in the sale of granite blocks for memorial use on the basis of price  color  quality  geographic proximity  service  design availability  production capability  availability of supply and delivery options 
all of the company s colors of granite are subject to competition from memorial grade granite blocks of similar color supplied by quarriers located throughout the world 
there are approximately manufacturers of granite memorials in north america 
there are also manufacturers of granite memorials in india  south africa  china and portugal that sell finished memorials in north america 
the company s quarrying and manufacturing competitors include both domestic and international companies  some of which may have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than the company 
foreign competitors of the company may have access to lower cost labor and better commercial deposits of memorial grade granite  and may be subject to less restrictive regulatory requirements than the company 
for example  companies in south africa  india  china and portugal also manufacture and export finished granite memorials into north america which compete with the company s products 
the competition for retail sales of granite memorials faced by the company s retail outlets is also intense and is based on price  quality  service  design availability and breadth of product line 
competitors include funeral home and cemetery owners  including consolidators  which have greater financial resources than the company  as well as approximately  independent retailers of granite memorials located outside of cemeteries and funeral homes 
the sale of cemetery lots and related products is highly competitive 
the competition is based upon price  geographic locations  and the overall aesthetics  maintenance and upkeep of the cemetery 
competitors include churches and municipalities that own and operate cemeteries  and other cemetery owners  including consolidators  which may have greater financial resources than the company 
we cannot assure you that domestic or foreign competition will not adversely impact our business 
sales of our products are seasonal and may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
historically  our operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally  our net sales are highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather 
cemeteries in northern regions generally do not accept granite memorials during winter months when the ground is frozen because they cannot be properly set 
we typically close certain of our vermont and canadian quarries during these months because of increased operating costs attributable to weather conditions 
we have historically incurred an aggregate net loss during the first six months of each calendar year 
our operating results may vary materially from quarter to quarter due to  among other things  acquisitions  changes in product mix and limitations on the timing of price increases  making quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful 
our competitive position could be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our tradenames  trademarks  brands  designs and other intellectual property are of great value  and we rely on trademark  copyright and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to this valuable intellectual property 
third parties may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property 
in addition  our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights 
we may need to resort to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights  most notably the rock of ages trademark  could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position 
the increasing trend toward cremation  and potential declines in memorialization for other reasons  may result in decreased sales of our products 
there is an increasing trend toward cremation in the united states 
according to the cremation association of north america  or cana  cremation was used in approximately of the deaths in the united states in  compared to approximately in  and cana expects this rate to rise to approximately by while we continue to believe that most families will choose to memorialize their loved ones  regardless of whether they choose cremation over a traditional burial  to the extent increases in cremation rates result in decreases in memorialization rates  this decrease will result in a decline in our memorial sales  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is also subject to the risk that memorialization rates may decline over time for other reasons 
certain cemeteries have in the past and may in the future limit the use of granite memorials as a memorialization option 
to the extent that general memorialization rates or the willingness of cemeteries to accept granite memorials declines  this decline could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to a number of operating risks that are difficult to predict and manage 
our quarry and manufacturing operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent in those industries  including among others  unanticipated surface or underground conditions  varying memorial grade granite recovery rates due to natural cracks and other imperfections in granite quarries  equipment failures  accidents and worker injuries  labor issues  weather conditions and events  unanticipated transportation costs and price fluctuations 
as a result  actual costs and expenditures  production quantities and delivery dates  as well as revenues  may differ materially from those anticipated  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our international operations may expose us to a number of risks related to conducting business in foreign countries 
we derived approximately of our revenues in fiscal from sales outside the united states  with approximately of revenues in fiscal from sales in canada by the company s canadian subsidiaries 
in prior years such percentage represented by international sales has been higher 
foreign sales are subject to numerous risks  including currency conversion risks  limitations including taxes on the reparation of earnings  slower and more difficult accounts receivable collection and greater complication and expense in complying with foreign laws 
sales of our ancillary products are cyclical  which may adversely affect our operating results 
the markets for our industrial precision products  which include machine base and surface plates that are utilized in the automotive  aeronautic  computer  machine tool  optical  precision grinding and inspection industries  and granite press rolls used in the manufacture of paper  are subject to substantial cyclical variations 
sales of these products have declined significantly as a result of the recent general economic downturn and may continue to decline upon a further or sustained downturn in  or as a result of uncertainties regarding current and future economic conditions that generally affect  such industries 
we cannot assure you that changes in the industries to which we sell our precision products will not adversely affect our operating results 
existing stockholders are able to exercise significant control over us 
kurt m 
swenson and his brother  kevin c 
swenson  collectively have of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of our common stock  and will therefore be in a position to control the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of transactions involving a change in control of the company 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with government regulations 
our quarry and manufacturing operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal and state governmental statutes and agencies  including the federal occupational safety and health act  the mine safety and health administration and similar state and canadian authorities 
our operations are also subject to extensive laws  and regulations administered by the united states environmental protection agency and similar state and canadian authorities  for the protection of the environment  including but not limited to those relating to air and water quality  solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal 
these laws and regulations may require parties to fund remedial action or to pay damages regardless of fault 
environmental laws and regulations may also impose liability with respect to divested or terminated operations even if the operations were divested or terminated many years ago 
in addition  current and future environmental or occupational health and safety laws  regulations or regulatory interpretations may require significant expenditures for compliance  which could require us to modify or curtail our operations 
we cannot predict the effect of such laws  regulations or regulatory interpretations on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
while we expect to be able to continue to comply with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations  any material non compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
provisions of our corporate organizational documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of the company  even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders 
certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by laws grant ten votes per share to each share of class b common stock  divide the board of directors into three classes  each of which will have a different three year term  provide that the stockholders may remove directors from office only for cause and by a supermajority vote  provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the board of directors or certain company officers and not by stockholders  establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for stockholder proposals to be considered at annual stockholders meetings  authorize the issuance of preferred stock 
accordingly  the board of directors is empowered  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of  or be dilutive to  the holders of our common stock 
certain of these provisions may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit or delay large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us
