item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented below relates to the operations of world airways as reflected in its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is an explanation of the company s critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
accounting for aircraft maintenance costs the company s maintenance costs are prone to greater fluctuations from year to year under the direct expense method of accounting as opposed to the accrual method of accounting  which was used prior to the change in accounting effective january  under the direct expense method  costs are recognized as maintenance services are performed and as nonrefundable maintenance payments required by lease agreements and maintenance contracts with outside maintenance providers become due 
the company s aircraft are maintained by outside maintenance providers 
in certain cases  aircraft maintenance costs are covered by maintenance reserve payments made to the lessors of the company s aircraft 
in these cases  the company is required to set aside funds to cover future maintenance work 
this is done by remitting these non refundable amounts to the lessors each month 
after qualifying maintenance is performed and paid for  the company is reimbursed for amounts paid from the funds held by the lessors 
the result of this arrangement is that the company recognizes maintenance costs each month based on the amount of the maintenance reserves required to be paid to its lessors usually based on a rate per hour flown 
in other cases  maintenance work does not qualify for reimbursement from lessor reserves 
this may be due to the type of maintenance performed or whether the aircraft component being maintained is covered by a lease agreement 
for maintenance that is not covered by lessor reserves  the company recognizes the costs when maintenance services are performed 
therefore  these maintenance costs will fluctuate from period to period as scheduled maintenance work comes due or in the event unscheduled maintenance work must be performed 
it is also important to note that aggregate maintenance reserves paid to each of the company s lessors may not be sufficient to cover actual maintenance costs incurred 
in these cases  the company incurs the cost of any shortfall when the maintenance services are performed and the costs are determinable

table of contents activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the company has early adopted this statement for the year ended december  the company is obligated under an operating lease for office space at its former headquarters in herndon  virginia through april the company received rental income  sufficient to offset its lease expense  through march  after which time no rental income was received 
the company is currently seeking a new sub lessee and is examining its options with respect to early terminating its obligations under its lease 
as a result  the company has recognized a million liability at december  for costs that will continue to be incurred  without economic benefit to the company  over the remaining term of its lease of this office space 
the fair value of the liability at december  was determined based on the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that can be reasonably obtained for the property 
the liability is included in other accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the cost is included in sales  general and administrative on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
management was required to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of this liability 
these included an estimated eight month period  starting january   in which the company will not obtain any sublease rentals while seeking a sub lessee and an estimated percent discount that will be provided to a suitable sub lessee from the company s current monthly lease rentals 
these assumptions were determined based on current market conditions for commercial office space in herndon  virginia and the metropolitan washington  dc area 
if the company is not successful in finding a suitable sub lessee in the anticipated time or if the sublease rentals from a new sub lessee are less than anticipated  the company will be required to recognize an additional liability for these costs 
this liability will be adjusted for changes  if any  resulting from revisions to estimated cash flows  measured using the credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to measure the liability initially of percent 
the company s total obligation at december  under the lease is million 
accounting for the stabilization act grant under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the stabilization act  the company was entitled to receive as a grant the lesser of its actual direct and incremental losses for the period september  to december  or its maximum allocation of grant funds as determined by the dot

this grant was included as a credit to operating expenses in the statement of operations 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
to the extent that the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss will be recognized based on the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its estimated fair market value 
if the company determines that assets  such as aircraft parts  are no longer needed to support operations  they are reclassified to assets held for sale and are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
at 
table of contents december   the book value of assets held for sale was million 
net realizable value is determined based on the estimated fair value measured by using a current selling price for similar assets less estimated selling costs 
changes in industry capacity  the manner of use by the company of its assets  and demand for air transportation can significantly impact fair value
