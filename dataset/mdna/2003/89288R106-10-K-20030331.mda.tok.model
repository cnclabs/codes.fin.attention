item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other information included in item a and of this annual report on form k 
the company has restated its consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  to conform to the presentation for the year ended december  these reclassifications and adjustments are described in item selected consolidated financial data and item financial statements and supplementary data  note  restatement and had no impact on net income loss  earnings loss per share or stockholders equity in any period 
overview the company s global services revenue streams consist primarily of payments made pursuant to service contracts and variable transaction oriented payments 
the company typically receives base monthly fees from clients for services provided under its facilities management and property management contracts 
the fees received by the company for the provision of transaction services corporate advisory services and brokerage are typically paid in connection with the consummation of a transaction such as the purchase or sale of commercial property or the execution of a lease 
the company also earns fees from project and construction management that are typically determined by the size and cost of the project 
the arrangement may be part of a management service contract or on an individual project basis 
the company s development and investment revenue streams consist primarily of payments related to individual real estate development projects 
revenues from the company s development activities consist of development and construction fees  which are typically based upon a negotiated percentage of a project s cost  and incentive development fees for completing a development project under budget  within certain critical time deadlines and or for achieving specified leasing targets 
income from the company s investment activities primarily consists of gain on disposition of real estate and income from unconsolidated subsidiaries that hold real estate assets 
the company has limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss 
because the disposition or impairment of a single significant investment can impact the company s financial performance in any period  these investment activities create fluctuations in the company s revenues 
because the company s investment strategy typically entails making relatively modest investments alongside its corporate and institutional clients  its ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets 
during  the company s business continued to be adversely impacted by the deterioration of the economy as a whole 
the downturn in the economy and its resultant work force layoffs and business failures have led to higher than normal vacancy rates in many markets 
that fact  coupled with uncertainty as to the timing of any economic recovery  has negatively impacted the timing and the amount of revenues and profits generated from several of the company s services  including project leasing  investment sales  tenant representation  project management and development and investment activities 
the company believes that this deterioration in the economy will continue to impact its business in the company s expenses typically consist of salaries  wages and benefits  commissions  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest 
salaries  wages and benefits and commissions constitute a majority of the company s total costs and expenses 
over the last three years  an average of of the company s income loss from continuing operations adjusted to add back non recurring charges in and relating to writedowns due to impairment of goodwill  intangibles and investments  net of related minority interest in  the restructuring charges and change in fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreement  net of interest expense offset has been generated in the fourth quarter  due primarily to a calendar year end focus by the customers of the commercial real estate industry on the completion of transactions 
in addition  certain of the company s property management and outsourcing contracts provide for bonus payments if the company achieves certain performance targets 
such incentive payments are generally recognized in the fourth quarter 
in contrast  the company s non variable operating expenses  which are treated as expenses when incurred during the year  are relatively constant on a quarterly basis 
see quarterly results of operations and seasonality 
critical accounting policies management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
they also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of the company s accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on its financial statements than others  due to the magnitude of the underlying financial statement elements 
consolidation the company s determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to its investments in subsidiaries is based on the amount of control the company has  combined with its ownership level  in the underlying entity 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and other subsidiaries over which the company has control 
the company s investments in subsidiaries in which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but does not control including subsidiaries where the company has less than ownership  are accounted for on the equity method 
all other investments of the company are accounted for on the cost method 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
the company is in the process of determining which of its investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries qualify as variable interest entities and assessing the impact of fin on its consolidated financial statements  and will apply the provisions of fin to entities formed prior to february   in the quarter ending september  the provisions of fin will be immediately applied to entities formed after january  the company believes it is reasonably possible that some of the unconsolidated subsidiaries in which it has an investment may be considered variable interest entities under fin and will therefore be consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary 
as a result  the company could consolidate more entities than it presently does under the existing rules for consolidation 
accounting for an investment as either consolidated or by the equity method would have no impact on the company s net income loss or stockholders equity in any accounting period  but a change in treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items  as consolidation would effectively gross up the company s income statement and balance sheet 
however  if control aspects of an investment accounted for by the cost method were different  it could result in the company being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method 
under the cost method  the investor only records its share of the underlying entity s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee  when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor s share of the investee s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor s investment  the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment 
under the cost method  the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee 
conversely  under either consolidation or equity method accounting  the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss  to the extent of its investment or its guarantees of the underlying entity s debt 
at december   million of the company s million total investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries relates to investments that are accounted for using the cost method 
accounting for an investment under either the equity or cost method has no impact on evaluation of impairment of the underlying investment  under either method  impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of permanent losses of value 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue is recognized existence of persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s various revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria 
the revenues of the company s business that are subject to the most judgment are its brokerage commission revenues and incentive based management and development fees 
the company s brokerage commission revenues are comprised of commissions earned for investment sales  project leasing and tenant representation transactions 
revenues from investment sales transactions are recognized upon the closing of a sale and are generally paid to the company by the seller out of the sale proceeds  therefore  there is no estimation or judgment involved in the recognition of these revenues 
project leasing and tenant representation commissions are generally recorded half upon execution of a lease contract  and the remainder upon tenant occupancy 
the company performs thousands of project leasing and tenant representation transactions annually  each of which is typically governed by a separate commission agreement 
while the majority of these agreements generally provide that half of the commission is earned upon execution of a lease contract and half upon tenant occupancy  agreements do vary as to their terms and complexity  usually due to negotiation of the commission agreement language with the customer 
if there are any contingencies with respect to any portion of the commission  that portion of the commission is not recognized until the contingency is resolved 
the unique nature and complexity of each brokerage transaction require the company to use varying levels of judgment in determining timing of revenue recognition 
the judgment involved in revenue recognition is understanding the complex terms of the agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms 
each transaction is evaluated to determine at what point in time revenues are earned  whether there are contingencies involved that would impact the timing of recognition of revenue  and how such contingencies will be resolved 
the actual timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made 
the company earns incentive development and management fees from its development services  property management services and certain services provided to corporate customers in the company s global services segment  including facilities management services  project management services and corporate advisory services 
these fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets  customer service levels  or achieved levels of operating expense savings or  for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria  upon approval of the fee by the customers 
in accordance with eitf topic d  accounting for management fees based on a formula  the company s incentive development and management fee revenues are not recognized to the extent that such revenues are subject to future performance contingencies  but rather once the performance period has ended 
certain of these fees may require estimates and judgment by the company and  as such  actual revenue may differ from the company s estimates 
carrying value of real estate  goodwill and intangible assets as of december   the company s total real estate  goodwill and intangible assets were million  million and million  respectively  and of total assets  respectively 
goodwill reflects the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of real estate service companies acquired by the company primarily in  and intangible assets primarily include management contracts and employment non compete agreements for certain employees entered into in connection with these acquisitions and in connection with the hiring of certain other employees 
intangible assets also include upfront cash payments made to customers and certain contract acquisition costs incurred upon initiation of new long term corporate contracts 
effective january   the company adopted statements of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas and no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
these statements continue to require the company to evaluate the carrying value of its real estate  goodwill and intangible assets based on assumptions and estimates of fair value and future cash flow information 
these assumptions and estimates developed by the company may differ from actual results 
if different assumptions and estimates were used  carrying values could be adversely impacted  resulting in writedowns that would adversely affect the company s earnings 
prior to january   the company s real estate  goodwill and intangible assets were accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
real estate with respect to the company s real estate assets  fas established more restrictive criteria than fas to classify an asset as held for sale 
at december   assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of the fas held for sale criteria 
on december   any real estate assets that did not meet the held for sale criteria of fas were reclassified to one of the following line items in the company s balance sheet i real estate under development current  which includes real estate that the company is in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date  ii real estate under development non current  which includes real estate that the company is in the process of developing that is expected to take longer than one year from the balance sheet date to complete and dispose of  or iii real estate held for investment  which consists of completed assets not expected to be disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date and land on which development activities have not yet commenced 
fas does not require assets from previous periods to be reclassified 
any asset reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate under development current or non current or real estate held for investment is measured individually at the lower of its carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as real estate held for investment  or the fair value at the date of the reclassification 
real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
if an asset s fair value less cost to sell  based on discounted future cash flows or market comparisons  is less than its carrying amount  an allowance is recorded against the asset 
real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation  as applicable 
when indicators of impairment are present  real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset s carrying amount 
the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis or market comparisons 
buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives  generally years 
tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight line method over the terms of the respective leases 
in accordance with fas  the company evaluates each of its real estate assets in order to determine the classification of each asset in the company s balance sheet 
this evaluation requires judgment by the company in determining certain criteria that must be evaluated under fas  such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which the company expects to sell its real estate assets 
the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment 
had the company evaluated its assets differently  the balance sheet classification of such assets  depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 
prior to january   fas required real estate held for sale to be recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value  based on discounted future cash flows or other measures of fair value 
the determination of future cash flows or fair value was based upon assumptions and estimates of forecasted financial information that may have differed from actual results 
if different assumptions and estimates had been used  carrying values could have been adversely impacted  resulting in writedowns that would have adversely affected the company s earnings 
fas extended the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity  but further required that  for a component to be classified as a discontinued operation  the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
as defined in fas  a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
because each of the company s real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary  almost every real estate asset constitutes a component of an entity under fas  increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets the company holds for sale in the ordinary course of business must be reported as a discontinued operation unless the company has significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after its disposition 
operating profits and losses on discontinued operations are required to be recognized in the periods in which they occur 
goodwill upon adoption of fas  the company was required to determine its reporting units  which became the basis of its future annual goodwill impairment tests 
the required impairment tests are based on a comparison of the fair value of each of the company s reporting units to the carrying value of such unit 
a writedown of goodwill would be recognized if the fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value 
the company identified its reporting units to mirror its two segments  global services and development and investment  as each segment s underlying business units have similar long term economic characteristics and service deliveries 
if the company defined its reporting units differently  the results of its annual impairment tests could be impacted 
the company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill in  and has determined that no impairment of goodwill exists at december  prior to january   fas required the company to evaluate the carrying value of its goodwill at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows when indicators of impairment were present 
under fas  impairment losses were recorded when estimates of undiscounted future cash flows were less then the value of the underlying asset 
the determination of future cash flows was based on assumptions and estimates of forecasted financial information that may have differed from actual results 
under fas  effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized  which would have increased and net income loss by approximately million per share and million per share  respectively  had fas been in effect in such periods 
prior to the adoption of fas  the company amortized its goodwill balances on a straight line basis over periods of to years 
the evaluation of the useful life of goodwill required judgment by the company  and had the company chosen a shorter time period over which to amortize goodwill  amortization expense would have increased  adversely impacting the company s operations 
in  the company recorded writedowns due to impairment of goodwill and intangibles of million  offset by million of related minority interest 
of these writedowns  million is due to impairment of goodwill and related intangibles recorded in connection with the faison acquisition 
the impairment resulted from operating losses and declining forecasts for future operations in the retail center development and mall management portions of these businesses primarily due to continuing consolidation of regional mall ownership into reit s  which tend to self manage their properties  in addition to the losses of several large management agreements in  which left the company with no significant business in certain geographic areas 
the writedown included of the goodwill attributable to the retail center development and mall management businesses and the business units affected by management agreement losses 
effective march   the company sold the retail center development and mall management businesses to an affiliate of faison enterprises the faison sale 
the company retained the net working capital in these businesses and carried interests in certain development projects  but otherwise received nominal consideration upon completion of the transaction 
in addition to the deteriorating operating results  the faison sale was motivated by changes in the company s overall retail strategy 
the company has taken steps to downsize and eliminate various retail operations that did not achieve anticipated profit levels and integrate its retail professionals into its local services businesses where retail customers can benefit from the integration of strong networks of product lines  such as brokerage  management  development and outsourcing  with its retail operations 
also included in the company s total writedowns is a writedown of million  offset by million of related minority interest  due to impairment of goodwill recorded in connection with the company s expansion of its joint venture with savills into the asia pacific region trammell crow savills asia pacific 
the impairment resulted from operating losses and business strategy changes that impact the company s growth strategy in asia pacific markets 
the company intends to allocate existing or additional resources to asia pacific markets as its us customers require services in these markets but does not intend to aggressively pursue new customers in these markets 
in  trammell crow savills asia pacific sold three of its operations  primarily engaged in project management services  to an unrelated third party 
the remaining million of writedowns in related to various investment and asset impairments  none of which were individually significant to the company 
in  the company recorded a million writedown due to impairment of goodwill and related intangibles recorded in connection with an acquisition of the business of doppelt company in august  representing the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition 
the impairment was triggered by i the loss in the fourth quarter of of key management and revenue producing personnel hired from the acquired company  ii the loss of key national customers related to the acquired company and resignation from unprofitable accounts  and iii the identification in the fourth quarter of of increasing losses  as well as a net loss for the fourth quarter of  for the acquired business instead of a net profit for the fourth quarter of as was expected at the end of the third quarter of in evaluating the extent of the impairment related this acquisition  the company considered the following factors i a reduction of revenue from the largest individual customer of the acquired company and an announcement by the customer that it would be further reducing the services required by the company  ii the business plan related to the acquired company did not include any additional revenues from the acquired company clients and iii the company s determination that there was no positive cash flow or earnings associated with the acquired company and the company s reluctance to commit additional resources to the acquired business 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
impairment losses are recorded when estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are less than the value of the underlying asset 
the determination of future cash flows is based on assumptions and estimates of forecasted financial information that may differ from actual results 
in  the company recognized a writedown of million recorded as a reduction of facilities management revenues due to the impairment of intangible related to an upfront cash payment made to a customer upon inception of a management contract in a previous period 
the company and the customer mutually agreed to terminate the contract in also  in the company recognized a writedown of million recorded as a reduction of project management services revenues due to the impairment of an intangible related to an upfront contract payment made to a customer upon inception of the agreement in a previous period 
the company had determined that the future cash flows from the underlying contract did not support the value of the intangible  and it was the company s intent to terminate the contract 
the company and the customer mutually agreed to terminate the contract in the company has considered the average life of its management contracts to determine the period over which to amortize intangible assets related to acquired management contracts  which is the company s estimate of the useful life of the underlying management contracts 
this estimate requires judgment by the company  and had the company chosen a shorter time period over which to amortize such intangible assets  amortization expense would have increased  adversely impacting the company s operations 
the company amortizes intangible assets resulting from employment non compete agreements to compensation expense over the period of time that future services to the company are required  as stipulated in the applicable agreement  or over the period of time that the employee is obligated to repay such amounts to the company if his employment is terminated 
intangible assets related to upfront cash payments made to customers and certain contract acquisition costs are amortized as a reduction of the related revenue over the life of the underlying contract 
results of operations the following table sets forth items from the company s consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   as a percent of total revenue for the periods indicated 
years ended december  restated restated revenues corporate services facilities management corporate advisory services project management services institutional services property management brokerage construction management development and construction fees gain on disposition of real estate other costs and expenses salaries  wages and benefits commissions general and administrative depreciation amortization interest writedowns due to impairment of goodwill  intangibles and investments change in fair value of interest rate swap agreement restructuring charges income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries income tax expense benefit minority interest  net of income taxes income from investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries  net of income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
the company s total revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in facilities management revenue  which represented of the company s total revenue in  increased million  or  to million in from million in this revenue growth primarily resulted from the addition of several new customers and the expansion of services provided to existing customers  offset by customer losses 
furthermore  the increase in revenue was partially offset by a charge to revenue of million in  due to the writedown for impairment in the value of an intangible asset 
the intangible asset written down included upfront cash payments to a customer made upon inception of the underlying management contract in a previous year 
the company and the customer mutually agreed to terminate such contract in and accordingly  the value of the related intangible asset was written down to zero 
reimbursement of salaries  wages  benefits and out of pocket general and administrative costs  a component of facilities management revenue  increased million to million in  from million in the composition of facilities management revenue  including management fees and reimbursements  can vary significantly from period to period based on the structure of the underlying management agreements in effect in each period 
corporate advisory services revenue  which represented of the company s total revenue  decreased million  or  to million in from million in while the company had a slight increase in the number of tenant representation brokers in as compared to  revenue per broker decreased due to a reduction in transaction volume and value as a result of increasing reluctance on the part of customers and others to make new real estate commitments due to the downturn in the economy  which has resulted in decreased demand for commercial space 
revenues from project management services totaled million in and represented of the company s total revenue in these revenues increased million  or  from million in revenue growth resulting from the addition of several new customers and the expansion of services provided to existing customers was partially offset by the loss of certain customers and a reduction in project spending by certain other corporate customers as a result of the deterioration in the economy 
additionally  revenues reflect a charge to revenue of million in due to the writedown for impairment in the value of an intangible asset comprised of upfront cash payments made to a customer upon inception of the underlying management agreement in a previous year 
the company determined that the future cash flows from the underlying agreement did not support the value of the intangible and it was the company s intent to terminate the agreement 
the management agreement was subsequently terminated in property management revenue  which represented of the company s total revenue in  decreased million  or to million in from million in the decrease was primarily the result of the company s sale of its mall management business to an affiliate of faison enterprises  inc the faison sale in the first quarter of revenue also decreased due to an overall reduction in average square footage under management  as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of the company s exit from certain unprofitable markets 
reimbursement of salaries  wages  benefits  and out of pocket general and administrative costs decreased from million in to million in  and comprised million of the overall reduction in property management revenue in brokerage revenue  which represented of the company s total revenue in  decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in transaction volume and value as a result of increasing reluctance on the part of customers and others to make new real estate commitments due to the downturn in the economy and uncertain economic outlook 
the economic downturn has resulted in decreased demand for commercial space  which  in turn  has driven a decrease in the average number of project leasing and investment sales brokers employed by the company during  as compared to the prior year 
construction management revenues totaled million in and represented of the company s total revenue in these revenues decreased million  or  from million in construction management revenues are generated from services including space planning and tenant finish coordination for institutional customers in conjunction with property management and leasing assignments  and are directly related to the customer s real estate demands 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in transaction volume due to an increasing reluctance on the part of customers and others to make new real estate commitments due to the downturn in the economy  in addition to a decrease in the average square footage managed by the company 
also  a portion of the decrease in construction management revenues was driven by the company s disposition of several construction businesses in the second half of and in revenues from development and construction fees totaled million in and represented of the company s total revenue in these revenues decreased million  or  from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in development fees and incentive development fees  as well as revenue generated from services including construction bidding and management  project closeout  and general contracting 
the decrease is a result of a reduction in transaction volume due to an increasing reluctance on the part of customers and others to make new real estate commitments due to the downturn in the economy and uncertain economic outlook 
in addition  rental revenues decreased million in  primarily due to the sale of various operating properties that generated rental revenues in gain on disposition of real estate totaled million in and represented of the company s total revenue in these gains decreased million  or  from million in in  the company sold real estate projects for an aggregate net sales price of million  resulting in an aggregate gain on disposition of million  including recognition of deferred gain of million relating to dispositions in previous periods 
in addition  in the company sold three real estate projects with an aggregate gain on disposition of million for which the company did not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the projects after their disposal 
the gains on disposition for these three sales are reflected as discontinued operations  rather than gains on disposition of real estate  in accordance with the requirements of fas in  the company sold real estate projects for an aggregate net sales price of million  resulting in an aggregate gain on disposition of million  including recognition of deferred gain of million relating to dispositions in previous periods 
the company s revenue from thematic development activity has remained stable with an increase since in development and construction activity related to higher education and healthcare customers  offset by declines in development and construction activity for other customers  including corporate build to suits 
some of the company s development resources focus on providing development services to institutional clients that invest in speculative commercial real estate projects 
since the latter part of  speculative real estate development has declined significantly 
the decline reflects the fact that demand for new product in most of the markets in which the company operates has declined with the overall downturn in the economy 
costs and expenses 
the company s costs and expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in in december  the company recorded million of writedowns due to impairment of goodwill  intangibles and investments  offset by million of related minority interest 
the company also recorded million due to the change in fair value of its interest rate swap agreement  which was offset by a benefit to interest expense of million  and recorded million in restructuring charges 
see below for further discussion 
salaries  wages and benefits expense includes all compensation paid to company employees other than brokerage commissions 
as such  it includes salaries  benefits and annual incentive bonuses for employees whose compensation is reimbursed by customers reimbursed employees  salaries  benefits and annual incentive bonuses for employees whose compensation is not so reimbursed unreimbursed employees  and transaction related incentive compensation other than brokerage commissions  primarily paid in connection with development and investment transactions 
salaries  wages and benefits expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was comprised of a million increase in salaries and benefits for reimbursed employees associated with growth in reimbursed headcount resulting primarily from growth in the company s outsourcing business  offset by a million decrease in salaries and benefits for unreimbursed employees  as a result of the company s cost reduction efforts begun in second quarter commissions decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in commission expense was primarily driven by the overall decrease in the company s corporate advisory services and brokerage revenue  due to a reduction in transaction volume and value as a result of increasing reluctance on the part of customers and others to make new real estate commitments due to the downturn in the economy and uncertain economic outlook  which have resulted in decreased demand for commercial space 
the percentage decrease in commission expense does not correspond directly to the percentage decrease in corporate advisory services and brokerage revenue due to changes made to compensation structures for various project leasing and investment sales brokers at the beginning of  the compensation structures in include less fixed compensation and more variable compensation at higher commission rates 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses was comprised of an million decrease in costs that are not reimbursed by customers  offset by a million increase in out of pocket general and administrative expenses that are reimbursed by customers 
the decrease in unreimbursed general and administrative expenses was the result of company wide cost reduction efforts undertaken beginning in the second quarter of the company s cost reductions were partially offset by costs associated with the company s efforts to restructure or exit several outsourcing contracts that were unprofitable or otherwise judged likely to be unsuccessful in the long run 
general and administrative expenses in also include million for provision for losses on real estate due to impairment and for adjustments to carrying value of real estate assets reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate held for investment  while provision for losses on real estate due to impairment totaled million in depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in amortization expense of million in of which million of the decrease for such periods was due to the company s adoption of fas  which provides that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  effective january  in addition  the company also incurred less amortization expense as a result of intangible asset writedowns recorded in the fourth quarter of interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower interest rates related to the company s revolving line of credit and lower average outstanding balances in in addition  in  the company recorded million of payments against its interest rate swap agreement liability as compared to million of such payments in these payments would have been recorded to interest expense had the interest rate swap agreement not been designated as an effective hedge as of november  in  the company recorded million offset by million of related minority interest of writedowns due to impairment of goodwill  intangibles and investments 
the company recorded million of these writedowns related to goodwill and intangible assets see carrying value of real estate  goodwill  and intangible assets  above 
in addition  the company recorded million of the total writedowns to reflect impairment in the value of certain e commerce investments made in  and the impairment was triggered by i the status at the time of the writedowns of the e commerce industry many technology companies had ceased operations  the availability of capital for e commerce and internet companies had been dramatically reduced  and the dow jones internet index was down and ii the financial status of the companies in which the company has invested 
in evaluating the extent of the impairment related to its e commerce investments  the company considered the following factors i financial results of the investees versus their original business plans  ii the value of the investee companies based on solicitations for additional financing  iii the investees revised business plans and iv the investees need for and limited availability of future funding 
on september   as a result of a decrease in the company s floating interest rate debt  the company dedesignated million of the company s million interest rate swap agreement previously designated as a hedge in order to maintain the relationship between the notional amount of the designated portion of the interest rate swap agreement and the amount of the company s floating rate debt 
on november   an additional million was dedesignated 
as a result of these changes  the company recognized million of expense in related to the change in fair value of the portion of the interest rate swap agreement that is not designated as a hedge 
prior to november   the million interest rate swap agreement was not effectively designated as a hedge although it was entered into for hedging purposes  and the company recognized changes in fair value in current period earnings 
this resulted in million being recognized as expense related to the interest rate swap agreement for the period from january   through october   due to a change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement 
as of november   the company effectively elected hedge accounting treatment and began using the hypothetical derivative method as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities fas  to measure hedge effectiveness for its interest rate swap agreement 
during  the company incurred a total of million in restructuring charges as a result of an internal reorganization of its business designed to consolidate all of the property and facilities management  brokerage and corporate advisory  and construction and project management services delivered to both corporate and institutional customers under a single leadership structure 
as part of the reorganization  the company terminated approximately employees across all functions and levels as part of a cost cutting effort focusing on inefficiencies and redundancies 
the company incurred restructuring charges of million related to these terminations 
in addition  also in  the company formalized and communicated its previously announced internal reorganization designed to centralize and improve the efficiency of its accounting operations 
the accounting restructuring plan contemplated the termination of approximately accounting personnel  of whom ultimately resigned or were placed into open positions or onto new customer accounts 
the company incurred restructuring charges of million related to these terminations 
also as part of its restructuring plans  in  the company closed several offices and identified offices with excess space that it intends to sublease to third parties 
the company recorded million of restructuring charges related to these activities  primarily comprised of future rent charges and cost to sublease offset by estimated future sublease income and miscellaneous future and equipment write offs

the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
revenues and net income loss before non recurring items such as writedowns  change in fair value of interest rate swap agreement and restructuring charges during the fourth fiscal quarter historically have been somewhat greater than in each of the first three fiscal quarters  primarily because the company s clients have demonstrated a tendency to close transactions toward the end of the fiscal year

the base rate is the higher of the prime lending rate announced from time to time by the administrative agent or an average federal funds rate plus 
eurodollar rate loans bear interest at the eurocurrency rate plus a margin  which ranges from to  depending upon the company s leverage ratio 
the credit facility contains various covenants such as the maintenance of minimum equity  liquidity  revenues  interest coverage ratios and fixed charge ratios 
the credit facility also includes limitations on payment of cash dividends or other distributions of assets  restrictions on recourse indebtedness and total indebtedness  restrictions on liens and certain restrictions on investments and acquisitions that can be made by the company

borrowings under the discretionary line are unsecured and reduce borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
at december   the company had outstanding borrowings of million under the credit facility and no borrowings outstanding under the discretionary line 
the covenants contained in the credit facility and the amount of the company s other borrowings and contingent liabilities may have the effect of limiting the credit available to the company under the credit facility to an amount less than the million commitment 
as it takes longer for the company to dispose of real estate investments in a weaker economy  the current economic slow down could adversely impact the company s ability to comply with certain of the real estate related financial covenants in the company s credit facility  which could negatively impact the company s borrowing capacity 
also  since many of the financial covenants in the credit facility are dependent on the company s ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement and calculated on a trailing four quarter basis  a decline in the company s overall operations could adversely impact the company s ability to comply with these financial covenants and  in turn  the company s borrowing capacity

the company does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  together with existing cash and available credit under the credit facility and loans secured by underlying real estate will be sufficient to finance its current operations  planned capital expenditure requirements  payment obligations for development purchases  acquisitions of service companies and internal growth for the foreseeable future 
the company s need  if any  to raise additional funds to meet its working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success and pace of its implementation of its growth strategy 
the company regularly considers capital raising alternatives to be able to take advantage of available avenues to supplement its working capital  including strategic corporate partnerships or other alliances  bank borrowings and the sale of equity and or debt securities 
in may  the company announced that its board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program

investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries as part of its real estate development activities  the company has numerous investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  generally with unrelated parties 
since the company does not control these subsidiaries  it accounts for its investment using the equity method or the cost method 
these underlying entities typically own real estate investments and carry debt related to the financing of such real estate 
because these subsidiaries are unconsolidated  the subsidiaries real estate investments and related debt are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheet  the company s consolidated balance sheet instead captures the company s investment in the subsidiaries 
in some cases  the company has guaranteed repayment of the debt of such entities and therefore would be required to repay the guaranteed portion of debt if the underlying entity defaults on its obligation 
on december   the company paid  to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of realty holdings  inc rhi  a corporation that was formed to invest in real estate partnerships the rhi purchase

prior to the rhi purchase  the company had invested  in exchange for all of the shares of non voting preferred stock of rhi  and eleven individuals  all of whom were current or former executives of the company  collectively owned the shares of outstanding common stock of rhi with each of these individuals investing 
these executives ownership of common stock of rhi was not contingent on continued employment with the company 
however  a majority of the stockholders of rhi had the ability to cause rhi to purchase any other stockholder s shares of rhi at any time for any reason 
rhi also had the right of first refusal to purchase the shares of a common stockholder if such stockholder wished to sell his shares and had a bona fide written offer from a third party 
rhi is controlled by its board of directors  which is elected by the common shareholders 
each of the three directors is an officer of the company  but none was a stockholder of rhi 
through december   rhi had invested in five single purpose real estate projects as a or general partner  with wholly owned subsidiaries of the company as or limited partners 
rhi and the company each had minimal investments in such subsidiaries  since the underlying real estate projects were financed with third party debt 
at december   the company had guaranteed repayment of million of debt of such entities 
with respect to two of the projects to which these guarantees relate  the company had agreements with institutional or investment grade investors to purchase the project and repay the related debt upon completion of the project 
rhi has controlling interests in each of the entities in which it invests 
prior to the rhi purchase  the company did not control rhi and  as such  it accounted for its investment in rhi under the equity method and  accordingly  recorded its share of profits and losses of such underlying entities as income loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries 
as a result of the rhi purchase  the company owns of rhi  and accordingly  on december   began to account for rhi as a consolidated subsidiary 
rhi has a general partnership interest in trammell crow investment fund iv  lp fund iv  a discretionary development and investment fund in which the company holds a limited partnership interest  with the remaining limited partner interests held by unrelated parties 
since rhi controls fund iv  and rhi is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company as of december   the company began consolidating fund iv on december  the company s share of income loss of rhi and fund iv was million and million  respectively  for up to the time that rhi and fund iv were consolidated by the company and million and million  respectively  for effects of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on its results of operations in recent years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its credit facility and loans secured by real estate properties as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the credit facility and the majority of the loans secured by real estate bear interest at variable rates and are subject to fluctuations in the market 
however  due to its purchase of an interest rate swap agreement  which the company uses to hedge a portion  but not all  of its exposure to fluctuations in interest rate  the effects of interest rate changes are limited 
if an increase or decrease in market interest rates of basis points were to have occurred at december   the company s total estimated interest costs for would increase or decrease  and estimated income from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries would decrease or increase accordingly  by approximately million  including the effect of its interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  which expires march  the company s sensitivity analysis is based on borrowings outstanding as of december  if the market interest rates for variable rate debt had been basis points higher or lower in  the company s total interest costs would have increased or decreased accordingly  and income from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries would have decreased or increased accordingly  by approximately million  after considering the effect of the interest rate swap agreement in effect during interest costs include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate 
a portion of the interest relating to the company s real estate debt million at december  is capitalized 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in a higher interest rate environment 
the company s earnings are somewhat affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of its operations in canada  europe  asia and australia 
at december   a uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s foreign operations are denominated would result in an estimated decrease or increase accordingly in income from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries of approximately million for the year ending december  if  during the year ended december   a uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s foreign operations are denominated had occurred  it would have resulted in a decrease or increase accordingly in income from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries of approximately million 
these calculations assume that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar and are based on either the company s actual or an estimate of income from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries from foreign operations 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes to its anticipated level of foreign operations or local currency prices
