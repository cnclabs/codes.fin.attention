sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill

at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments

the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the pension expense will be  down from used for the rate of compensation increase used in determining the pension cost was for us defined benefit pension plans and for the pension cost for us defined benefit plans

as provided by statements no 
and  the company has chosen to continue use of the accounting method under apb and the related interpretations to account for the company s stock compensation plans 
as adoption of statement no 
only involves disclosures by the company  there is no impact from its adoption on the company s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin no 

the interpretation requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that obligation 
this interpretation is intended to improve the comparability of financial reporting  by requiring identical accounting for guarantees issued with separately identified consideration and guarantees issued without separately identified consideration 
the disclosure provisions of fin no 
are effective for the company as of december  the company has guarantees and claims arising during the course of its business operations 
the company accrues for losses under these arrangements when they become probable and estimable 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company is currently evaluating what impact  if any  adoption of fin no 
will have on its consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
internal reinvestment capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for  compared with million for approximately of the expenditures in were for equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity 
the company s capital expenditures are expected to increase when compared with levels  with a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand low cost manufacturing facilities 
product development and engineering product development and engineering expenses are directed toward the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes 
such expenses were million in  an increase from million in  and million in included in the amounts above are net expenses for research and development of million for  million for  and million for environmental matters certain historic processes in the manufacture of previous ametek products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations 
while these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time  the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp regarding waste remediation at several non ametek sites that are the subject of government mandated cleanups 
in addition to these non ametek sites  the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its manufacturing locations and for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable 
total environmental reserves at december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
in  the company spent approximately million on such environmental matters  compared with approximately million in the company also has agreements with former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under which the company and former owners have retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the other party against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances 
the company and some of the other parties carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters 
to date  those parties have met their obligation in all material respects 
the company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their obligation in the future 
however  if the company were required to record a liability with respect to all  or a portion of  such matters on its balance sheet  the amount of the liability would not be significant 
in the opinion of management  based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters  either adequate provision for probable costs has been made  or the ultimate cost resulting from these actions are not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flow of the company 
impact of inflation the company attempts to minimize the impact of inflation through cost reduction programs and by improving productivity 
in addition  the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for most inventories whereby the cost of products sold approximates current costs  and therefore  the impact of inflation is substantially reflected in operating costs 
in general  the company believes programs are in place that are designed to monitor the impact of inflation and to take necessary steps to minimize inflation s effect on operations 
market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates on its short term debt  and in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s long term debt is fixed rate debt and its short term debt is variable rate debt 
these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the financial statements 
the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure include the euro  the japanese yen  and the british pound sterling 
exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored  and when possible  mitigated through the use of local borrowings in the foreign country affected 
the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income  within stockholders equity 
foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in either interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are not material  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
