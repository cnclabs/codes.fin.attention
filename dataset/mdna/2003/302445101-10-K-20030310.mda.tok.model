item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview flir was founded in  originally providing infrared imaging systems that were installed on vehicles for use in conducting energy audits of neighborhoods by helping to determine whether there was any abnormal leakage of heat coming from the doors  windows  walls and roofs of each house 
as demand for that application declined  the company began to focus on other applications and markets for its technology  in particular  designing and selling stabilized thermal imaging systems for aircraft used by law enforcement 
since then  the company has continued to develop thermal imaging products for a growing number of applications and has now become one of the world leaders in the design  manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for a wide variety of applications in the commercial  industrial and government markets 
over the years  due to its growth  the company has experienced significant changes in its structure and operations and our business is now organized around two principal business segments  thermography and imaging 
the thermography market primarily consists of the use of hand held thermal imaging systems that can detect and measure minute temperature differences  which is useful for a wide variety of commercial applications 
these applications fall into four basic categories predictive maintenance also known as condition monitoring  research and development  process control and monitoring  and product development 
in this market  there has been significant transition as we phased out many products utilizing older infrared detector technology called cooled technology and focused on those products that utilize a newer  less expensive detector technology known as uncooled technology 
our thermography products are produced at our facility in sweden 
the imaging market primarily consists of the use of infrared imaging cameras that are incorporated into highly stabilized turrets  which we call gimbals  for use on helicopters  fixed wing aircraft  and all types of ships 
in addition  we also manufacture ground based and hand held systems 
we also make products specifically developed for firefighters 
applications for our imaging products include search and rescue  navigation safety  drug interdiction  law enforcement support  maritime and border patrol  surveillance and reconnaissance  perimeter security and firefighting 
our imaging products are primarily produced at our portland and boston facilities 
we continue to enhance our state of the art products within both markets  as well as develop products for new market applications that use advanced thermal imaging technologies 
for example  uncooled detector technology now used in our thermography systems enable these systems to operate at room temperature  allowing for systems that are less expensive  smaller  lighter  and more energy efficient 
additionally  we are developing image analysis software tools that enhance the capability of our thermography products 
as hardware prices decline  the sophistication of image analysis software and the incremental functionality provided by such analysis tools are expected to become a more important component of thermography systems 
for our imaging products  we have begun to utilize a new type of cooled infrared detector technology called quantum well infrared photodetector  or qwip 
qwip provides for superior resolution yet is less expensive to produce 
in addition  we are continually improving the stabilization of our airborne systems and offering additional imaging options  such as ccd tv cameras  laser rangefinders and laser designators 
international revenue accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue 
with the production and distribution of our thermography products in sweden contributing a large volume of sales denominated in foreign currencies  we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 

table of contents the company typically experiences longer payment cycles on its international sales  which can have an adverse impact upon the company s liquidity 
in addition  substantial portions of the company s operations are conducted outside the united states  particularly in sweden 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and general economic conditions 
the company experiences fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variances and customer sales cycles  such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the us and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement by international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of december due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
such events have resulted and could continue to result in certain fluctuations in quarterly results in the future 
as a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  goodwill impairment  warranty obligations  contingencies and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our policy is to recognize revenue upon delivery of the product to the customer  passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations  pursuant to guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
we design  market and sell our products as standard  off the shelf products 
many of our imaging customers  particularly those who use our airborne systems  request different system configurations  based on standard options or accessories that we offer 
in general  our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria 
in those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate the system meets those specifications prior to shipment 
for any contracts with multiple elements ie  training  installation  additional parts  we recognize revenue only after we have determined that all elements essential to the functionality of the system have been delivered 
any undelivered items not considered essential to functionality  are deferred at their estimated fair value 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports 
table of contents and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
we also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology infrared systems  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventories becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventories may be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value 
as of december   our inventories of million are stated net of inventory reserves of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorate or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory reserves may be required 
goodwill impairment 
the company recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of agema infrared systems ab in during the year ended december   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
we annually review goodwill for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundary of the overall market capitalization of the company 
our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill asset  which has a carrying value of million as of december  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at december   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures  or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as 
table of contents our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
income taxes 
we record our deferred tax assets at an amount that we determine is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the future 
in making that determination  we estimate our future taxable income based upon historic operating results and external market data 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon  but not limited to  general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we have determined that no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million is required 
if we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses earnings loss from operations interest expense other income  net earnings loss before income taxes income tax provision net earnings loss excluding the one time charges in connection with the charges related to streamlining our manufacturing and corporate operations  cost of goods sold  gross profit  operating expenses  loss before taxes and net loss would have been     and  respectively 
years ended december   and revenue 
revenue for totaled million  an increase of over the million in revenue reported in revenue from the imaging business segment increased from million in to million in  while the thermography business segment reported a revenue increase of from million in to million in the increase in imaging revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly in our ground based products  and the mix of shipments within our airborne product offerings 
the thermography revenue increase was due to greater unit volume shipments  primarily due to the market acceptance of our new e series products  offset by the lower prices associated with the e series products and reductions in capital spending by our customer base which impacted our higher priced thermography products 

table of contents revenue increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the increased sales of the company s imaging products  as revenue from that business segment increased from million in to million in the revenue increase was experienced across most of the imaging product lines 
thermography revenue increased from million in to million in these increases in revenue were due to an increase in unit volumes attributable to the growth in the number of applications for infrared technology and the ability of our products to meet those applications  in addition to price increases we implemented late in international revenue in totaled million  representing of revenue 
this compares to international revenue in which totaled million  representing of revenue  and million  or of revenue  in while the sales mix between domestic and international sales may fluctuate slightly in any one year  we anticipate the mix to be approximately domestic and international on a long term basis 
gross profit 
as a percentage to revenue  gross profit in was compared to in the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the change in relative mix of revenue from our business segments 
we historically experience higher gross margins in our thermography business than in our imaging business 
in  imaging revenue represented of our total revenue compared to of total revenue in we believe that the gross margins within both of our business segments are representative of margins that the company will be able to realize on an on going basis  however  the relative mix of revenue between the two business segments will continue to influence our total gross margins 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit in was compared to in one time charges taken in related to the company s restructuring and streamlining of its operations included million in cost of goods sold 
without these one time charges in  gross profit would have been in the improvement in gross profit was primarily due to the price increases implemented late in and the decrease in manufacturing costs that resulted from the restructuring of operations that occurred in  including the elimination of older and lower margin products 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million during compared to million in while  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased from in to in  we believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business 
we expect research and development expenses to represent to of our revenue on a long term basis 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased from in to in in absolute dollars  research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in research and development expenses for included million in one time charges related to cost accumulations  asset valuations  workforce reductions and other costs associated with the company s efforts to restructure and streamline its operations in without these charges  research and development expenses in would have been million or of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenue  in to million  or of revenue  in the increase in spending was primarily due to the increase in selling and marketing expenses arising from the general business and revenue growth during  partially offset by a reduction of million in expenses from to related to the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill in we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to represent to of our revenue in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million  or of revenue  in to million  or of revenue  in the expenses in include one time charges of million associated with company s streamlining of its operations in that year 
without those charges  selling  general and administrative expenses would have been million or of revenue in the decrease in selling  
table of contents general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the one time charges taken in  the reduction in expense levels as result of the restructuring actions in  and reductions in certain administrative expenses  such as legal and audit fees  that were abnormally high in interest expense 
interest expense totaled million  million  and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest from to was due primarily to the reduction in debt as the company was able to use cash from operations and the proceeds from its december secondary stock offering to repay its outstanding debt 
the company s outstanding indebtedness under its primary credit agreement declined from million at the beginning of to million at the end of and was paid in full in february the decline from to was due to the debt payments during and a slightly lower average interest rate in due to the reductions in prime lending rates during the year and reductions in rates provided under the credit agreement based on the level of principal payments made in interest expense for  and also includes expenses associated with the company s interest rate swap agreements in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
the swap agreements were settled during income taxes 
the company s income tax provision was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the mix in taxable income between the company s us and foreign operations in each of these years and the expected utilization of the company s deferred tax assets significantly impacted the recording of the tax provisions 
in  and  the tax provision primarily represented taxes provided on income generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries  principally in sweden  and state income taxes in the us 
in  the company did not recognize a federal tax benefit on losses in the united states due to the inability to carry such losses back to prior years 
accordingly  valuation allowances were recorded against the deferred tax assets associated with the net operating loss carryforwards nols 
in and  the company was able to recognize those previously unrecognized loss benefits 
at december   the company had us nols totaling million which expire in the years through additionally  the company has various us tax credits available aggregating million  which expire in the years through the company has generated deductions of us taxes related to the exercise of stock options that have served to offset the reductions in its nols 
the utilization of these stock option exercise deductions is accounted for as a direct increase in additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in the company s tax provision 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes requires that the tax benefits described above be recorded as assets to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not  otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  management believes that the deferred tax assets of million reflected on the december  consolidated balance sheet  is realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon and has not recorded a valuation allowance 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon general economic conditions  including but not limited to continued growth of the thermography and imaging markets  competitive pressures on sales and gross margins  successful implementation of tax planning strategies  and other factors beyond the company s control 
no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in future periods if its future forecasts of taxable income are not achieved 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million in cash compared to million in total borrowings net of cash on hand at december  the company had no borrowings outstanding at december  the company was able to reduce its borrowings through cash provided by operating activities 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities in totaled million compared to million in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to net earnings  reductions in accounts receivable and an increase in accrued liabilities offset by an increase in inventories and a reduction in accounts payable 
cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to net earnings generated during the year and reductions in inventories offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
at december   the company had accounts receivable in the amount of million compared to million at december  the decrease in the receivable balance is primarily due to an increase in collection efforts 
consequently  days sales outstanding decreased from days at december  to days at december  the timing of sales  particularly the recording of large quantity or higher priced system sales  can significantly impact the calculation of days sales outstanding at any point in time 
at december   the company had inventories of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the general growth in the company s revenues 
however  as we continue to manage that growth  the company was able to improve its inventory turns from in to in at december   the company had prepaid expenses and other current assets of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in supplier advances and certain prepaid expenses  including insurance 
at december   the company had other long term assets of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in the intangible asset associated with the minimum liability for the company s supplemental executive retirement plan 
accrued payroll and related liabilities increased million from million at december  to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the timing of annual performance bonus payments 
pension and other long term liabilities decreased million  from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the settlement of the company s interest rate swap agreements and the reclassification to shareholders equity of a put option obligation of million related to common stock issued for the acquisition of the optronics division  offset by accruals for the company s retirement programs 
the company s investing activities have consisted primarily of expenditures for fixed assets  which totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on march   the company entered into a new credit agreement with bank of america  na  keybank  na  and union bank of california  na the agreement provides for a million  three year revolving line of credit with an option for an additional million during the first two years 
under the credit agreement  borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the bank of america or eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread over such rates based upon the company s leverage ratio 
at december   the interest rate ranged from to 
the credit agreement contains five financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain fixed charge and leverage ratios in addition to minimum levels of ebitda and consolidated net worth and a maximum level of capital expenditures 
the credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets of the company 
at december   the company had no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and was in compliance with all covenants 
the company  through two of its subsidiaries  has a million swedish kroner approximately million line of credit at and a million line of credit at at december  at december   the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines 
the million swedish kroner line of credit is 
table of contents secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventories of the applicable subsidiary and is subject to automatic renewal on an annual basis 
the million line of credit is secured by substantially all assets of the applicable subsidiary and is subject to renegotiation annually 
at the present  we do not have any significant capital commitments for the fiscal year 
consequently  we anticipate our cash requirements to be primarily related to the funding of our operating activities 
with the cash we have recently generated by our operating activities and the additional funds available through our credit agreements  we believe we have sufficient resources available to meet our cash requirements 
however  significant changes in those anticipated cash requirements or significant changes in business conditions that could negatively impact the generation of cash from operating activities could require the company to seek additional financing from other sources 
possible changes in business conditions are discussed in more detail in the section entitled risk factors located herein 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating rents and leases on certain facilities and equipment and are expensed as incurred 
as of december   the future annual minimal rental payments required under non cancelable leases total million in  million in  million in  million in and million in risk factors in addition to the factors discussed in the forward looking statements section provided at the beginning of this annual report on form k  the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
in addition  you should know that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant 
if we were unable to adequately respond to any risks  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will work 
fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance 
our quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
as a result of the fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
factors that may affect our future operating results include the timing  number and size of orders from  and shipments to  our customers  as well as the relative mix of those orders  a significant portion of our sales is made in the last month of each quarter  with sales frequently concentrated in the last week or days of the quarter  the timing and market acceptance of our or our competitors new products  product enhancements or technologies  the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products  changes in our or our competitors pricing policies  the timing and amount of any inventory write downs  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of critical components  foreign currency fluctuations  costs associated with the acquisition of other businesses  product lines or technologies  
table of contents our ability to integrate acquired businesses  product lines or technologies  and general economic conditions  both domestically and internationally 
seasonal fluctuations in our operating results  particularly the increase in sales we generally experience every year in the fourth quarter  result from the seasonal pattern of contracting by the us and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to january due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize yearly capital budgets prior to expiration 
we have had difficulties managing our growth 
we have grown rapidly from employees in to employees as of december  our annual revenue during that period grew from million to million and our operations became global in nature 
in the past  we experienced problems in developing and implementing a financial reporting and controls system commensurate with the substantial growth and increased complexity of our business 
we have taken a number of steps to improve our controls and systems  including the implementation of a new set of reporting and control procedures and protocols and the retention of a new executive management team and financial reporting personnel 
however  if these and other measures we take are inadequate to address the growth we are continuing to experience  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are under a cease and desist order from the sec  a violation of which could harm our business 
on june   the securities and exchange commission the sec issued a formal order of investigation of the company and certain officers  directors  employees and other individuals presently and formerly associated with the company to determine whether any violations of the federal securities laws occurred during and the investigation relates to the company s revenue recognition policies  accounting controls  financial reports and other public disclosures during that time period 
pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by the company  on september   the sec instituted and simultaneously settled a proceeding against the company under section a of the securities act of the securities act and section c of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
without admitting or denying the allegations of the sec s order  the company agreed to the entry of an order requiring that it cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities act and the antifraud  periodic reporting  record keeping and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws set forth in section a of the securities act and sections b  a  b a and b b of the exchange act and rules b  b  a and a thereunder 
the company incurred no financial fine or penalty under the terms of settlement 
the sec s order states that the company materially overstated its earnings before income taxes for each of the quarters of and as well as for fiscal year  and that the company s revenue recognition practices resulted in material misstatements and omissions in the financial statements contained in the company s annual report on form k as originally filed for the year ended december  and the company s quarterly reports on form q as originally filed for each of the first three quarters of both and in and  the company restated its financial statements for and no further restatements of the company s financial statements are required by the order  and the company does not expect that the entry of the order will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
should the company be found to have violated the terms of commission s order in the future  it may be subject to further enforcement action  including legal action imposing injunctive relief and assessing fines or penalties  which could have a material impact on our business 

table of contents a reduction in government purchasing or our inability to act as a us government contractor could significantly decrease revenue 
the government procurement process is complex and highly competitive 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to us and foreign government agencies and our business will continue to be substantially dependent upon such sales 
no sales to a single agency of the us government accounted for more than of our revenue last year  but aggregate sales to us government agencies accounted for of our revenue for and of our revenue for accordingly  our results of operations would be adversely impacted by governmental spending cuts and general budgetary constraints 
further  even though most of our government sales are not made for defense applications  a significant reduction in purchases of thermal imaging systems for defense applications could result in certain of our competitors committing more attention and resources to non defense applications  thereby exposing us to greater competitive pressures in our primary markets 
in addition  our ability to do business with the us government is conditioned upon our continuing eligibility to act as a federal contractor 
a significant decline in our sales to us or foreign governments or our disqualification from making such sales for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough if our sales decline 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales  and these expenses are largely fixed  particularly in the short term 
in addition  to enable us to promptly fill orders  we maintain inventories of finished goods  components and raw materials 
as a result  we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales 
accordingly  we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales 
any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods  components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write downs and write offs 
as a result  we may not carry adequate reserves to offset such write downs or write offs 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete 
the market for thermal imaging equipment is characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions  enhancements and modifications 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to develop new technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements 
we may need to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to develop and introduce new products and enhancements 
if we fail to timely develop and introduce new technologies  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
from time to time  we or our competitors may announce new products  product enhancements or technological innovations that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of our products and that may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products  resulting in inventory obsolescence 
we must successfully introduce new or enhanced products to be successful 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our existing products and to develop new products using the latest technology that can satisfy customer requirements 
for example  our near term success will depend on the continued acceptance of the star safire imaging product line and the p series and e series thermography product lines  sales of which we expect to generate a substantial amount of our annual revenue 
we are also investing a significant amount of our financial resources in the enhancement of some of our other existing products 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully complete these enhancements within the necessary time period or that customers will accept our new products  or any future products 
our failure to complete the enhancement of these products or the failure of our current or future products to gain or maintain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents competition in the market for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to compete effectively would adversely affect our business 
competition in the markets for our products is intense 
the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging  develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors 
we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product features  reliability and price 
additionally  our products compete indirectly with numerous other products  such as image intensifiers and low light cameras  for limited military and governmental funds 
finally  many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than we do 
all of these factors result in greater challenges from our existing competitors as well as increasing competition from new competitors and require us to continue to invest in  and focus on  research and development and new product innovation 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components of our products exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand  increased costs and loss of revenue 
we rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products 
accordingly  we could experience a shortage in the supply of some of our components 
in particular  we have a contract with bae systems bae for the supply of uncooled detectors for integration into our p series  e series and fireflir product lines 
bae is currently one of three large producers of specialized uncooled detectors 
subject to certain exceptions  the contract gives us the exclusive right to purchase uncooled detectors for use in the commercial market and a limited  non exclusive right to purchase uncooled detectors for use in the government market 
under the contract  we have the corresponding obligation to purchase uncooled detectors solely from bae for certain defined commercial applications 
currently  the p series  e series and other thermacam series of hand held products  thermovision  thermovision sentry and fireflir are our only products that use the bae detectors 
however  we intend to use uncooled detectors supplied by bae in other products 
the contract provides for the monthly delivery of a fixed number of uncooled detectors  which may be increased or decreased by us within certain limits 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that either i the number of detectors delivered to us under the contract is insufficient to satisfy our requirements or ii we are obligated to purchase detectors in excess of the number we require 
the contract covers the purchase of a fixed aggregate number of units 
after expiration of the contract  we may not be able to successfully negotiate a new contract with bae or another company for uncooled detectors 
failure by us to renew the contract or identify another source of uncooled detectors would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on past experience  we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components 
if the components provided by bae or any other significant supplier were to become unavailable  our manufacturing operations would be disrupted 
unless we could identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components  we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices 
any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical and sales personnel 
our future success depends on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified technical and sales personnel as may be required in the future 
we also cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents any acquisition or equity investment we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we have in the past  and may in the future  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or enter into joint ventures 
we may experience difficulties in assimilating the personnel  operations  products and technology acquired in any future acquisitions or investments we make 
additionally  we could lose the key personnel from any of the companies that we acquire  incur unanticipated costs and assume new liabilities 
any of these difficulties could disrupt our on going business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we might have to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our existing shareholders ownership 
no assurance can be given that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or that such acquisition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks from international sales and currency fluctuations 
we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for  and are expected to continue to account for  a significant portion of our revenue 
for the years ended december  and  international sales accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenue 
our international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the imposition of governmental controls  restrictions on the export of critical technology  trade restrictions  difficulty in collecting receivables  inadequate protection of intellectual property  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  political and economic instability  and general economic conditions 
historically  currency fluctuations have affected our operating results 
changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales are denominated or costs incurred have in the past caused  and could in the future cause  fluctuations in our operating results 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating the majority of our international sales in us dollars 
with respect to international sales denominated in us dollars  a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could make our products less price competitive 
no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in maintaining and obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct operations abroad  and the us congress may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments 
licenses are required from us government agencies under the export administration act  the trading with the enemy act of and the arms export control act of for export of many of our products 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses 
failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the us and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims 
our products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions 
while we have not yet had to recall a product  if any of our products are defective  we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  product defects could result in substantial product liability 
we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms 
our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
most of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents  making them more difficult to protect 
although we currently hold us patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products  we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology  products and trade names 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors 
likewise  we cannot be certain that measures taken to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure 
any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  because intellectual property does not necessarily represent a barrier to entry into the thermal imaging industry  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours 
litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry 
we cannot be sure that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
defending intellectual property lawsuits and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel 
an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties 
if licenses were not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  our business could be harmed 
we would be harmed if we were unable to use one of our facilities 
we manufacture our products at facilities located in portland  boston and stockholm 
our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of  for example  a prolonged power shortage  fire or other natural disaster  would prevent us from supplying products to our customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our articles  bylaws and shareholder rights plan as well as oregon law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our second restated articles of incorporation  first restated bylaws  oregon law and our shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its credit agreements 
the credit agreements are at variable rates 
a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows 
at december   no amounts were outstanding on any of the company s credit agreements  consequently  no sensitivity analysis is presented 
the company has assets  liabilities  and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
similarly  certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies 
assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom 
the company s investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term 
the company does not engage in forward currency exchange contracts to reduce its economic exposure to changes in exchange rates 
because the company markets  sells and licenses our products throughout the world  it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products 
our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings
