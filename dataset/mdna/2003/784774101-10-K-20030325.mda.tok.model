item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to such financial statements included elsewhere in this report beginning on page f the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to the differences are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview simple technology  inc  incorporated in march and renamed simpletech  inc in may  is a technology solutions provider offering products based on dram  sram and flash memory technologies 
headquartered in santa ana  california  the company is a leader in the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of memory solutions 
after experiencing year over year revenue growth of from to and from to  revenues declined in and increased in revenues in and were negatively impacted due to softening macro economic conditions  severe declines in the price of dram and flash components and significantly reduced sales to customers in the communications and networking markets 
as a result of increased demand for flash based consumer electronics and industrial applications in which solid state flash based storage displaces traditional storage  our flash memory products as a percentage of total revenues increased steadily from for to for for the fourth quarter of  flash memory products as a percentage of total revenues reached 
in november  semico research corporation projected data storage flash industry revenues to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of from to in and  our highest profit margin division was our industrial division 
in  our highest profit margin product line was our ic tower stacking product line 
we track revenues and gross margins for our industrial and commercial divisions 
we do not track separately  and do not intend to track separately  operating expenses for our industrial and commercial divisions 
conversely  we do track operating expenses for our xiran division  which is not expected to generate revenues until historically  a small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for an aggregate of of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in in  cdw computer centers accounted for of our total revenues 
in  cdw computer centers and unisys accounted for and of our total revenues  respectively 
in  cisco systems and cdw computer centers accounted for and of our total revenues  respectively 
other than cdw computer centers  cisco systems and unisys  no customer accounted for more than of our total revenues between and the composition of our major customer base changes from quarter to quarter as the market demand for our products changes and we expect this variability will continue in the future 
we expect that sales of our products to a small number of customers will continue to contribute materially to our revenues in the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by any of our major customers  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business risk factors sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of any key customer would materially reduce our sales 
international sales of our products constituted of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in no single foreign country accounted for more than of our revenues between and over of our international sales were denominated in us dollars between and in addition  our purchases of ic devices are currently denominated in us dollars 
however  we do face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
see business risk factors we face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries  including foreign currency fluctuations and trade barriers  that could lead to a decrease in demand for our products or an increase in the cost of the components used in our products 
in the past  we have been impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns resulting in lower sales in the first and second quarters of each year 
other factors  including component price fluctuations  may distort the effect of seasonality 
our ability to adjust our short term operating expenses in response to fluctuations in revenues is limited 
as a result  should revenues decrease to a level lower than expected in any given period  our results of operations could be harmed 
revenues are recognized at the time of shipment 
we face risks associated with declines in the market value of our products  product returns  inventory obsolescence  price protection and rebates 
see business risk factors product returns  order cancellations  inventory write downs  price protection and rebates could adversely effect our results of operations 
from our formation in march through september   we elected for federal and state income tax purposes to be treated as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code of and comparable state tax laws and filed our federal and state income tax returns during that period on that basis 
subsequent to our s corporation termination on september   we have paid federal and state corporate level income taxes as a c corporation

pro forma in comparison of the years ended december  and net revenues 
our revenues increased from million in to million in sales of memory products accounted for of our revenues in compared to of our revenues in the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to a increase in units shipped from million units in to million units in  partially offset by a decline in our average sales price from to the increase in unit volume resulted from unit volume increases of for flash products  for ic tower stacking products and for non dram  non flash products such as sram  hard drive upgrade kits and connectivity products  partially offset by a unit volume decrease of for standard memory products 
the increase in flash product units shipped resulted primarily from an increase in sales of flash products to consumers for applications such as digital camera  mp players and pda through direct marketers and mass market retailers 
the decrease in standard memory units shipped resulted primarily from continued weakness in the personal computer market 
the decrease in our average sales price resulted primarily from a steady decline of flash component prices during  partially offset by a marginal increase in overall dram component prices in the mix of products sold varies from quarter to quarter and may vary in the future  affecting our overall average sales price and gross margin 
our industrial division revenues decreased from million in to million in our industrial division revenues were negatively impacted in due to reduced sales to customers in the networking and communications markets 
commercial division revenues increased from million in to million in primarily due to a increase in flash products

our gross profit decreased from million in to million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in gross profit as a percentage of revenues declined from to primarily due to sharp declines in dram pricing during the second quarter of  which resulted in a gross profit as a percentage of revenue in that quarter 
we believe the sharp decline in dram pricing during the second quarter of resulted from failed consolidation discussions between micron and hynix  two of the largest dram manufacturers in the industry 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was relatively flat for our industrial division at in and in gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our commercial division decreased to in from in primarily due to the impact of dram price declines for the second quarter of on dram inventory held in stock 
as a result of our industrial division selling a larger percentage of higher margin  higher capacity dram  flash memory and ic tower stacking products  gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our industrial division is typically higher than our commercial division

research and development expenses increased from million in to million in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in research and development expenses increased year over year from to due to a significant expansion of our research and development staff to serve our growing industrial division customer base and to develop new product lines 
in january  we completed a million acquisition of the assets  including intellectual property  of irvine networks  llc  and hired their engineering staff 
irvine networks  renamed our xiran division  is developing a universal solution to accelerate the delivery of content between network and storage 
operating costs for the xiran division were approximately million in  excluding a million non recurring in process research and development charge related to the acquisition  and are expected to increase to approximately million in the xiran division received its asic  the key component in its universal solution  from its fabrication partner  ibm  in december and is currently integrating the asic into board and system level products 
we expect to begin generating revenues from the xiran division in non recurring expenses 
we did not have non recurring expenses in non recurring expenses were million in and were comprised of in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of irvine networks in january interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net is comprised primarily of interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense related to our line of credit and equipment financing 
interest income expense  net was  in compared to million in interest income was  in and million in interest income decreased from to primarily due to lower interest rates

benefit provision for income taxes was million in and million in benefit provision for income taxes as a percentage of loss income before benefit provision for income taxes was in compared to in the increase in the effective rate in resulted from the application of state net operating loss carryforwards  prior year research and development and state enterprise zone hiring credits of approximately  taken in and current year research and development and state enterprise zone hiring credits of approximately  net loss income 
net loss income was million in and million in comparison of the years ended december  and net revenues 
our revenues decreased from million in to million in sales of memory products accounted for of our revenues in and of our revenues in the decrease in revenues from to was primarily due to a decrease in our average sales price from to  offset partially by a increase in units shipped from million units in to million units in the decrease in our average sales price resulted from significant declines in dram and flash component prices from october through november the increase in unit volume resulted from unit volume increases of for standard memory products and for flash products  partially offset by unit volume decreases of for ic tower stacking products and for non dram  non flash products such as sram  hard drive upgrade kits and connectivity products 
increases in flash and standard memory units shipped resulted primarily from market share gains achieved during in the mass market retailer channel 
decreases in ic tower stacking units shipped resulted from excess industrial division customer inventory levels throughout the mix of products sold varies from quarter to quarter and may vary in the future  affecting our overall average sales price and gross margin 
our industrial division revenues decreased from million in to million in our commercial division revenues decreased from million in to million in both our industrial and commercial division revenues were negatively impacted in due to softening macro economic conditions and severe declines in the price of dram and flash components  which resulted in significantly lower average selling prices 
our industrial division revenues were further impacted by a build up of inventory by our communications and networking customers during our combined backlog was million as of december  compared to million as of december  our industrial division backlog was million as of december  compared to million as of december  our commercial division backlog was  as of december  compared to million as of december  from to  the decrease in industrial division backlog resulted from a build up of inventory by our industrial division customers  which led to a significant reduction of orders 
commercial division backlog is typically nominal since substantially all commercial orders are filled on a same day or next day basis 
gross profit 
our gross profit decreased from million in to million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues remained flat at in compared to in gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our industrial division increased to in from in gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our commercial division increased to in from in primarily due to a positive shift in customer mix

non recurring expenses 
we did not have non recurring expenses in non recurring expenses were million in and were comprised of expenses related to a litigation settlement with interactive flight technologies  inc the settlement payment was made in january interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net is comprised primarily of interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense related to our line of credit and equipment financing 
interest income expense  net was million in compared to million in interest income was million in and  in interest income increased in compared to due to a higher average cash balance resulting primarily from initial public offering proceeds received in october and positive cash flow from operations in each quarter from the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of interest expense was  in and million in interest expense decreased significantly from to primarily due to the reduction of our line of credit balance to zero in october provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million in pro forma provision from income taxes was million in provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes was in pro forma provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes was in net income 
net income was million in assuming the termination of our s corporation status  pro forma net income would have been million in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  compared to working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents  as of december  our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased over the period primarily due to an investment in market securities of million and purchases of furniture  fixtures and equipment of million 
we had no outstanding principal balance under our million line of credit with comerica bank at december  and the line of credit expired in august and was not renewed 
current assets were times current liabilities at the end of  compared to times current liabilities at the end of net cash used by operating activities was  in net cash used by operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in net accounts receivable of million and an increase in net inventory of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million and non cash depreciation of million 
net inventory  net accounts receivable and accounts payable growth resulted from a increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from net income of million  a decrease in net accounts receivable of million and a decrease in net inventory of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
inventory and accounts payable decreased primarily due to the implementation of consignment inventory programs with our three largest component suppliers during and a sharp decline in dram and flash pricing during the year 
accounts receivable decreased due to the decline in overall revenues 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in in  net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from an investment in marketable securities of million  purchases of furniture  fixtures and equipment of million and an acquisition of a business for million 
in  net cash used in investing activities was attributable primarily to purchases of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
although we had no material capital expense commitments as of december   we expect to spend up to approximately million to million during the next months  primarily for manufacturing  testing and engineering equipment 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  in and  in net cash used in financing activities in resulted from the repayment of borrowings from banks and capital lease obligations of million  partially offset by the issuance of common stock for proceeds of  related to our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
net cash used in financing activities in resulted primarily from the repayment of borrowings from banks and capital lease obligations of million  partially offset by the issuance of common stock for proceeds of million related to our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
in  we also repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program at an average price of approximately per share  resulting in a total cash payment of approximately  in prior years  we entered into several capital leases and loans to finance manufacturing and testing equipment 
our obligations under capital leases were  on december  and  on december   with interest rates ranging from to per annum 
our equipment financing loan balances were paid down to zero at december  and had a balance of million on december   with interest rates ranging from to per annum 
prior to our conversion from an s corporation to a c corporation in september  we made cash distributions of a portion of our s corporation earnings to our shareholders of record as of september   for reasons including payment of their overall personal income taxes 
on september   we distributed to our shareholders of record as of september   in proportion to their ownership of our shares  notes in an aggregate principal amount of million  equal to our undistributed earnings from the date of our formation through september  we used a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to payoff the principal amount of these undistributed earnings notes on october  and november we believe that our existing assets  cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  price discounts on our products to our customers  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  our pursuit of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
inflation inflation was not a material factor in either revenue or operating expenses during the past three fiscal years ended december   and critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
reserves for inventory excess  obsolescence and lower of market values over costs we generally purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used in the near term 
changes in operating strategy  customer demand and unpredictable fluctuations in market values of raw materials can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased and sold through resulting finished goods to customers for a profit 
we regularly monitor potential inventory excess  obsolescence and lower market values compared to costs and  when necessary  reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 
allowances for doubtful accounts and price protection we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
additionally  we maintain allowances for limited price protection rights for inventories of our products held by our customers as a result of recent sales transactions to them 
if we reduce the list price of our products  these customers may receive a credit from us 
we estimate the impact of such pricing changes on a regular basis and adjust our allowances accordingly 
product returns we offer a majority of our customers that purchase products through our commercial channels limited rights to return unsold inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relationships with our customers 
we provide for estimated future returns of inventory at the time of sale based on historical experience  and actual results have been within our expectations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if our ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
litigation and other contingencies management regularly evaluates our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  our management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to our contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
changes in our operating strategy can significantly reduce the estimated useful life of such assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our existing variable rate debt 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million 
our variable rate equipment debt was paid down to zero at december   and our floating rate debt under the revolving credit facility expired in august and was not renewed 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents included million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts and million invested in securities  which represents investments in corporate bonds  auction rate securities and commercial paper with maturities of less than three months 
at december   our investments in securities with maturities of less than three months had a weighted average time to maturity of days 
at december   our investment in marketable securities was million 
the marketable securities consist primarily of  certificates of deposit with an original maturity of one year at different financial institutions 
at december   these marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
marketable securities represent investments with an original maturity of greater than three months 
these securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the intention and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity marketable securities have historically not been material 
if interest rates were to decrease  the result would be an annual decrease in our interest income related to our cash and cash equivalents of approximately  conversely  if interest rates were to increase  the result would be an annual increase in our interest expense related to our variable rate debt of approximately  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
more than of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive 
in addition  we purchase substantially all of our ic devices from local distributors of japanese  korean and taiwanese suppliers 
fluctuations in the currencies of japan  korea or taiwan could have an adverse impact on the cost of our raw materials 
to date  we have not entered any derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rates
