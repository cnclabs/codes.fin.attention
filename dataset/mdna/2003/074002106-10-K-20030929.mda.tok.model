the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients also drives our business 
changes in business requirements and practices of our clients have a significant impact on the demand for the technology consulting and systems integration services we provide 
the current economic downturn has negatively affected the operations of some of our clients  and in turn impacted their information technology spending 
during this time  competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has remained strong 
we do not expect business volumes to significantly improve during the next months 
we have responded to these challenging business conditions by focusing on a variety of revenue growth and cost control initiatives  including continued evaluation of the size of our workforce and required office space in relation to overall client demand for services  eliminating excess capacity and aggressively reducing discretionary costs to lower the cost of operations and maintain profit margins

prior year information has been reclassified to reflect current year changes 
effective for fiscal year  the company combined its consumer and industrial markets and high technology industry groups to form the consumer  industrial and technology industry group 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management s estimates and assumptions are derived and continually evaluated based on available information  reasonable judgment and the company s experience 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most critical to the company s financial condition and operating results pertain to revenue recognition including estimates of costs to complete engagements  valuation of accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill  and effective income tax rates 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we earn revenue from a range of consulting services  including  but not limited to  business and technology strategy  systems design  architecture  applications implementation  network  systems integration and managed services 
revenue includes all amounts that are billed or billable to clients  including out of pocket costs such as travel and subsistence for client service professional staff  costs of hardware and software and costs of subcontractors collectively referred to as other direct contract expenses 
unbilled revenue consists of recognized recoverable costs and accrued profits on contracts for which billings had not been presented to the clients as of the balance sheet date 
management anticipates that the collection of these amounts will occur within one year of the balance sheet date  with the exception of approximately million related to various long term government agencies contracts 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
services we enter into long term  fixed price  time and materials  and cost plus contracts to design  develop or modify multifaceted client specific information technology systems 
such arrangements represent a significant portion of our business and are accounted for in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
arrangements accounted for under sop must have a binding  legally enforceable contract in place before revenue can be recognized 
revenue under fixed price contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon costs to the client incurred as a percentage of the total estimated costs to the client 
revenue under time and materials contracts is based on fixed billable rates for hours delivered plus reimbursable costs 
revenue under cost plus contracts is recognized based upon reimbursable costs incurred plus estimated fees earned thereon 
we also enter into fixed price and time and materials contracts to provide general business consulting services  including  but not limited to  systems selection or assessment  feasibility studies  and business valuation and corporate strategy services 
such arrangements are accounted for in accordance with staff accounting 
table of contents bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue from such arrangements is recognized when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the fee is fixed or determinable  iii services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and iv collectibility of the related receivable or unbilled revenue is reasonably assured 
we periodically perform reviews of estimated revenue and costs on all of our contracts at an individual engagement level to assess if they are consistent with initial assumptions 
any changes to estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the change is identified 
loses on contracts are recognized when identified 
additionally  we enter into arrangements in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and systems provided to the client 
revenue from these types of arrangements is typically recognized on a ratable basis as earned over the term of the service period 
software we enter into a limited number of software licensing arrangements 
we recognize software license fee revenue in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition and its related interpretations 
our software licensing arrangements typically include multiple elements  such as software products  post contract customer support  and consulting and training services 
the aggregate arrangement fee is allocated to each of the undelivered elements based upon vendor specific evidence of fair value vsoe  with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to the delivered elements 
vsoe for each individual element is determined based upon prices charged to customers when these elements are sold separately 
fees allocated to each software element of the arrangement are recognized as revenue when the following criteria have been met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the product has occurred  iii the license fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
if evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time evidence of fair value does exist  or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
fees allocated to post contract customer support are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the support period 
fees allocated to other services are recognized as revenue as the services are performed 
revenue from monthly license charge or hosting arrangements is recognized on a subscription basis over the period in which the client uses the product 
multiple element arrangements for service offerings in certain arrangements  we enter into contracts that include the delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design  development or modification of systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and systems provided to the client 
such contracts are divided into separate units of accounting and the total arrangement fee is allocated to each unit based on its relative fair value 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
valuation of accounts receivable 
periodically  we review accounts receivable to reassess our estimates of collectibility 
we provide valuation reserves for bad debts based on specific identification of likely and probable losses 
in addition  we provide valuation reserves for estimates of aged receivables that may be written off  based upon historical experience 
these valuation reserves are periodically re evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality  other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due  and the quality of our collection efforts 
valuation of goodwill 
effective july   the company early adopted the new accounting principle related to goodwill  statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a consequence  we recognized a transitional impairment loss of million  net of tax  per share as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this transitional impairment loss resulted from the change in method of measuring impairments 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the first step of the goodwill impairment 
table of contents test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
our reporting units are our north american industry groups and our international geographic segments 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenues  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired at the respective testing dates 
we conduct our annual impairment test as of april of each year 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this situation would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the reporting unit s goodwill is impaired 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would become the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill 
effective income tax rates 
determing effect income tax rates are highly dependent upon management estimates and judgments  particularly at each interim reporting date 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include restrictions on the use of the company s foreign subsidiary losses to reduce the company s tax burden  the preparation of our corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
significant components of our statements of operations revenue 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from professional service activities 
revenue includes all amounts that are billed or billable to clients  including out of pocket costs such as travel and subsistence for client service professional staff  costs of hardware and software and costs to subcontractors collectively referred to as other direct contract expenses 
unbilled revenue represents revenue for services performed that have not been billed 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of revenue is reasonably assured 
we generally enter into long term  fixed price  time and materials and cost plus contracts to design  develop or modify multifaceted client specific information technology systems 
we generally recognize the majority of our revenue on a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as services are provided see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we enter into contracts with our clients that contain varying terms and conditions 
these contracts generally provide that they can be terminated without significant advance notice or penalty 
generally  in the event that a client terminates a project  the client remains obligated to pay for services performed and expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 
professional compensation 
professional compensation consists of payroll and related benefits associated with client service professional staff including costs associated with reductions in workforce 
other direct contract expenses 
as indicated above  other direct contract expenses include costs directly attributable to client engagements 
these costs include out of pocket costs such as travel and subsistence for client service professional staff  costs of hardware and software  and costs of subcontractors 

table of contents other costs of service 
other costs of service primarily consist of the costs attributable to the support of the client service professional staff  bad debt expense relating to accounts receivable  as well as other indirect costs attributable to serving our client base 
these costs include occupancy costs related to office space utilized by professional staff  depreciation and amortization costs related to assets used in revenue generating activities  the costs of training and recruiting professional staff  and costs associated with professional support personnel 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets represents the amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets related to customer and market related intangible assets which primarily resulted from the various acquisitions of businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs related to marketing  information systems  depreciation and amortization  finance and accounting  human resources  sales force  and other expenses related to managing and growing our business 
during fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses also include costs associated with our rebranding effort 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense reflects interest incurred on the company s borrowings  including interest incurred on private placement senior notes  borrowings under a receivables purchase facility and borrowings under revolving lines of credit 
interest income represents interest earned on short term investments of available cash and cash equivalents 
equity in losses of affiliate and loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate 
equity in losses of affiliate and loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate related to qwest cyber 
solutions llc qcs  which was established in june as a joint venture with qwest communications international  inc to provide comprehensive internet based application service provider  application hosting and application management services 
qcs incurred cumulative losses in excess of million from its inception to december  and periodically required additional capital to fund its operations and acquire equipment to support the expansion of its business 
we decided not to make any additional capital contributions to qcs and on december   qcs redeemed our ownership interest in the joint venture in exchange for a nominal amount 
accordingly  our investment in qcs of million million on a net of tax basis was written off through a non cash charge to earnings in december income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate is significantly impacted by its level of pre tax earnings and non deductible expenses 
accordingly  if our pre tax earnings grow and non deductible expenses grow at a slower rate or decrease  our effective tax rate will decrease 
due to our high level of non deductible travel related expenses  and unusable foreign tax losses and credits  our effective tax rate exceeds our statutory rates 
conversion discount on series a preferred stock 
on january   cisco systems  inc cisco purchased million shares of our series a preferred stock for billion 
on september   cisco and kpmg llp agreed that immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering  kpmg llp would purchase million shares of series a preferred stock from cisco for million 
our agreement with cisco required us to repurchase that number of shares of our series a preferred stock that would result in cisco owning of our common stock following the conversion and the initial public offering 
at the initial public offering price of there was a  or million conversion discount  such that the series a preferred stock would convert into our common stock at per share for an equivalent of million shares 
on november   kpmg llp agreed to convert all of the series a preferred stock it agreed to acquire from cisco at the initial public offering price without any conversion discount 
thus  the net amount of the beneficial conversion feature after deducting the amount of the conversion discount foregone by kpmg llp was million 
the intrinsic value ie  the beneficial conversion feature ascribable to the series a preferred stock as a result of the discounted conversion price was reflected as a preferred dividend and a reduction of net income available to common stockholders as of the date of the initial public offering see note  series a mandatorily reedemable convertible preferred stock  of the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  from  million in the year ended june   compared to  million in the year ended june  the overall increase in revenue was predominantly due to the impact of the acquisitions completed during the first half of fiscal year our three international operating segments ie emea and the asia pacific and latin america regions accounted for million  or  of the global revenue increase  principally resulting from the aforementioned acquisitions 
total north america revenue increased by million  or  to billion as increases in three of our north america business units public services  financial services and consumer and industrial markets were nearly completely offset by declines in the communications content and high technology business units 
north america revenue was positively impacted by personnel acquired from andersen business consulting during the first quarter of fiscal year as engagement hours increased by  however  a decline in the average gross bill rate per hour for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  partially offset the higher level of engagement hours

gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined to for the fiscal year ended june   compared to for the fiscal year ended june  this decline is mainly attributable to an increase in professional compensation expense in relation to revenue resulting from the addition of approximately  billable employees in connection with the acquisitions completed in the first half of fiscal year  offset in part by the company s continued focus on a variety of revenue growth and cost control initiatives  including continued evaluation of required office space and the size of our workforce in relation to overall client demand for services 
in dollar terms  gross profit increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase in gross profit was due to an increase in revenue of million described above  offset by a net increase in professional compensation of million  or  from million for the year ended june   to  million for the year ended june  this increase is primarily related to the additional compensation expense in relation to revenue resulting from the addition of approximately  billable employees as a result of acquisitions completed in the first half of fiscal year  including million relating to common stock awards made to certain former partners of the andersen business consulting practices 
these increases are partially offset by savings achieved though the company s workforce reduction actions that have occurred over the past months in response to the challenging economy 
a net increase in other direct contract expenses of million  or  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended june   to million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  the million increase in other direct contract expenses is attributable to higher revenue levels  while the improvement in other direct contract expenses as a percentage of revenue to is due to the company s continued efforts to limit the use of subcontractors and travel related expenses 
a net increase in other costs of service of million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  this increase is primarily due to an increase in other costs of service resulting from the acquisitions completed in the first half of fiscal year  partially offset by lower levels of bad debt expense and tighter controls on discretionary spending

amortization of purchased intangible assets

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  this increase is principally due to the impact of the acquisitions completed in the first half of fiscal year and million in costs associated with the company s rebranding initiative  offset partially by reduced discretionary spending and current cost control initiatives

interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  decreased million to million of net interest expense from million of net interest income for the year ended june  and  respectively 
this increase in net interest expense is due to an increase in borrowings outstanding of million from million at june  to million at june  the increase in borrowings is primarily due to the company s borrowing of million in august under a short term revolving credit facility  which was retired in november upon the company s completion of a private placement of million in senior notes 
additionally  the company has increased borrowings under its other credit facilities

in august  the company reported that it would restate its financial results for the first three quarters of fiscal year the restatements will require the company to amend our previously filed form q s for each of the quarterly periods within we are currently in the process of preparing these amendments to our previously filed form q s 
the restatements occurred in the following general areas purchase accounting resulting from the application of sfas no 
business combinations and eitf recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  revenue recognition related to contract accounting and the application of sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  the accounting treatment of accrued liabilities and the use of estimated months to account for operations subsequent to certain international business acquisitions  and the accounting treatment of stock awards and related shareholder notes 
in total these adjustments resulted in a decrease in previously reported net income and earnings per share in the first  second and third quarters of fiscal year of million  or per share  million or per share and million  or per share  respectively 
summarized below is a more detailed discussion of the restatements along with a comparison of the amounts previously reported in the statement of operations in our form q s for the months ended september  december  and march   respectively 
purchase accounting during the quarter ended september   the company completed various acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business acquisitions  resulting in approximately million in identified intangible assets 
these acquisitions included the purchase of kpmg consulting ag  a substantial consulting practice in germany  and the purchase of all or parts of a number of andersen business consulting practices worldwide 
the company completed preliminary purchase price allocations to allocate the purchase prices to acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the excess of the cost of the acquired entities over the amounts assigned to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill 
as part of the initial purchase price allocation  value was ascribed to only contractual backlog order backlog and a trade name 
this additional allocation was determined to be too low  and accordingly  an additional million of value for identified intangible assets related to customer contracts and related customer relationships was allocated to these identified intangible assets with a corresponding reduction to goodwill 
the additional intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives ranging from to months 
as a result  approximately million  million and million of incremental amortization of purchased intangible assets were recorded in the quarters ended september   december  and march   respectively 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended june  the company completed a series of restructurings related to many of its purchase business acquisitions increasing goodwill by approximately million and million for the quarters ended december  and march   respectively  for certain charges relating to exiting from leased facilities 
it was determined that these charges did not satisfy the criteria to be included in purchase accounting in accordance with eitf  and were therefore deducted from goodwill and charged to costs of service 
contract accounting in one of our international consulting practices  we identified an accumulation of work in process on our balance sheet 
the company identified approximately million  million and million in revenue related to pre contract activities that was inappropriately recognized in the quarters ended september   december  and march   respectively 
as such  these amounts have been reversed from revenue  as no contractual arrangement existed at the time the amounts were recorded and recovery of these costs were not considered probable 
in addition  the company identified certain circumstances where the percentage of completion method as prescribed under statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts was not appropriately applied 
on a combined net basis  approximately million and million have been reversed from revenue in the quarters ended september  and march   respectively  and approximately million of additional revenue was recognized in the quarter ended december  in addition  costs of service was reduced by approximately million and million in the quarters ended september  and march   respectively  and increased by million in the quarter ended december  accruals during fiscal  we recorded accrued liabilities for our fringe benefits based on cost factors associated with projected labor hours 
during fiscal  we did not adjust the accrual as assumptions were revised 
as a result  adjustments related to correct the calculated fringe benefit accruals of approximately million and million reduced costs of service for the quarters ended september  and december   respectively  and increased costs of service by approximately million for the quarter ended march  in connection with an increase in its deductible for its professional indemnity insurance  the company established an accrued liability of million during the quarter ended march  this accrued liability was determined to be unwarranted and was therefore reversed  resulting in a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company completed a number of business acquisitions 
at the end of the first post transaction fiscal reporting period the quarter ended september   certain of the entities were not able to close their books on a timely basis for us public reporting purposes 
as a result  the company  in an effort to conform to a fiscal year convention  recorded an estimated month income statement and a net asset or liability account on the balance sheet for those entities 
the company has restated the respective quarters on a conforming fiscal period end  and has eliminated the effect of the estimated month 
the company reduced revenue by million and million for the quarters ended september  and december   respectively  and increased revenue by million for the quarter ended march   decreased costs of service by million and million for the quarters ended september  and december   respectively  and increased costs of service by million for the quarter ended march   reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by million and million for the quarters ended september  and march   respectively  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million for the quarter ended december  
table of contents stock awards and shareholders notes it was determined that the historical accounting applied to certain stock awards and shareholder notes was not appropriate 
therefore  reserves recorded against such shareholder notes during the quarters ended september   december  and march  were not appropriate 
therefore  these reserves were reversed  decreasing selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million  million and million for the quarters ended september   december  and march   respectively 
other adjustments impacting net income other adjustments recorded that were identified through both timely quarterly reviews as well as during the year end closing process and ordinary course of the audit 
these adjustments were not material either individually or in the aggregate to income before taxes 
reclassifications not impacting net income statement of operations reclassification adjustments were identified through both timely quarterly reviews as well as during the year end closing process and ordinary course of the audit 
the reclassifications are being made to conform the amounts previously reported to the restated presentations 
these reclassifications do not impact net income

table of contents the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the last eight quarters 
in management s opinion  the quarterly information contains all adjustments necessary to fairly present such information

under the transition services agreement with kpmg llp which generally terminates no later than february  for non technology services and february  for technology related services  the company contracted to receive certain infrastructure support services from kpmg llp until the company completes the build out of its own infrastructure 
if the company terminates services prior to the end of the term for such services  the company may be obligated to pay kpmg llp termination costs  as defined in the transition services agreement  incurred as a result of kpmg llp winding down and terminating such services 
kpmg llp and the company have agreed that during the term of the transition services agreement the parties will work together to minimize any termination costs including transitioning personnel and contracts from kpmg llp to our company  and the company will wind down its receipt of services from kpmg llp and develop its own internal infrastructure and support capabilities or seek third party providers of such services

at this time there are no terminated services for which termination costs remain unknown 
the amount of termination costs that the company will pay to kpmg llp depends upon the timing of service terminations  the ability of the parties to work together to minimize the costs  and the amount of payments required under existing contracts with third parties for services provided to the company by kpmg llp and which can continue to be obtained directly by the company thereafter 
the amount of termination costs that the company will pay to kpmg llp under the transition services agreement with respect to services that are terminated after june  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time
