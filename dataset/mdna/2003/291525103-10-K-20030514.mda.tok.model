item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation ecc and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company and to emmis operating company and its subsidiaries collectively eoc 
eoc became a wholly owned subsidiary of ecc in connection with the company s reorganization see note c 
to our consolidated financial statements on june  unless otherwise noted  all disclosures contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in the form k apply to emmis and eoc 
the company s revenues are affected primarily by the advertising rates its entities charge 
these rates are in large part based on the entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
broadcast entities ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron radio market reports for radio stations and by ac nielsen company for television stations 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  the company s strategy is to use market research and advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services which can be used by the station in its business operations 
the company generally confines the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which the company would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is the company s general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under sfas no 
require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macro economic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under sfas no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  or to the extent that market values decrease 
allocations for purchased assets we typically engage an independent appraisal firm to value assets acquired in a material acquisition 
we use the appraisal report to allocate the purchase price of the acquisition 
to the extent that purchased assets are not allocated appropriately  depreciation and amortization expense could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances may be required

liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  agreements for future barter and program rights not yet available for broadcast at february   and employment contracts for key employees  all of which are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not have any off balance sheet financings or liabilities 
the company does not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements  nor does the company have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements or disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
summary disclosures about contractual cash obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of february  payments due by period amounts in thousands less than to to after contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt      operating leases      tv program rights payable      future tv program rights payable      radio broadcast agreements     employment agreements      total contractual cash obligations      ecc s senior discount notes accrete to a face value of million in march and become due in march as of february   the carrying value of the senior discount notes was million 
with respect to eoc  the above table would be the same except ecc s senior discount notes would be excluded 
tv program rights payable represents payments to be made to various program syndicators and distributors in accordance with current contracts for the rights to broadcast programs 
future tv program rights payable represents commitments for program rights not available for broadcast as of february we expect to fund these payments primarily with cash flows from operations  but we may also issue additional debt or equity or sell assets 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and cash available through revolving loan borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary uses of capital have been historically  and are expected to continue to be  funding acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and debt service and  in the case of ecc  preferred stock dividend requirements 
since we manage cash on a consolidated basis  any cash needs of a particular segment or operating entity are met by intercompany transactions 
see investing activities below for discussion of specific segment needs 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital for emmis and eoc of million and million  respectively 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital for emmis and eoc of million and million  respectively  excluding assets held for sale and associated liabilities 
the increase in net working capital primarily relates to the increase in cash and accounts receivable increasing more than the increase in current liabilities 
operating activities with respect to emmis  net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended february  compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
with respect to eoc  net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended february  compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended february  as compared to the same period in the prior year is due to our increase in net revenues less station operating expenses and corporate expenses  partially driven by cash savings generated by our stock compensation program 
we experienced a significant increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in our third fiscal quarter of the current year 
the third quarter of the prior year reflected the immediate impacts of the events of september  cash flows provided by operating activities are historically the highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as a significant portion of our accounts receivable collections is derived from revenues recognized in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are our highest revenue quarters 
investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended february  compared to cash used in investing of million in the same period of the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to our sales of radio stations in the year ended february  as opposed to our purchase of radio stations in the year ended february  investment activities include capital expenditures and business acquisitions and dispositions 
as discussed in results of operations above and in note to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements  emmis sold radio stations kalc fm and kxpk fm in denver  colorado for million in cash in the quarter ended may  the net cash proceeds of million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
as disclosed in the supplemental disclosures to the statements of cash flows  emmis acquired radio stations kklt fm  ktar am and kmvp am  in phoenix  arizona  in the quarter ended may  for cash of million 
the company financed the acquisition through a million advance payment borrowed under the credit facility in june and the remainder with borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from ecc s march senior discount notes offering 
emmis began programming and selling advertising on the radio stations on august  under a time brokerage agreement 
capital expenditures primarily relate to leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  tower upgrades and computer equipment replacements 
in the years ended february   and  we had capital expenditures of million  million  and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to the wala operating facility project  leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  tower upgrades and costs associated with our conversion to digital television 
we anticipate that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business  including approximately million in fiscal for the conversion to digital television 
although we expect that substantially all of our stations will broadcast a digital signal by the end of our fiscal  we will incur approximately million of additional costs  after fiscal  to upgrade the digital signals of three of our local stations and six of our satellite stations 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities for emmis and eoc were million and million  respectively  for the year ended february  cash flows provided by financing activities for emmis and eoc were million and million  respectively  for the same period of the prior year 
as discussed in note to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements  in april  ecc completed the sale of million shares of its class a common stock at per share resulting in total proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of million were contributed to eoc and of the net proceeds were used in april to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the remainder was invested  and in july distributed to ecc to redeem approximately of ecc s million  face value  senior discount notes see discussion below 
as indicated in investing activities above  net proceeds of million from the sale of two radio stations in denver were also used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility during the year ended february  on march   ecc received million of proceeds from the issuance of million face value  senior discount notes due the net proceeds of million  less million held in escrow at ecc  were distributed to eoc and used to fund the acquisition of the phoenix radio stations discussed in investing activities above 
in june  upon completion of the company s reorganization to form eoc and make ecc a holding company  the proceeds held in escrow were released and used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
as of february   eoc had  million of corporate indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility million and senior subordinated notes million  and other indebtedness million 
as of february   total indebtedness outstanding for emmis included all of eoc s indebtedness as well as million of ecc s senior discount notes 
ecc also had million of our convertible preferred stock outstanding 
all outstanding amounts under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
as of february   our weighted average borrowing rate under our credit facility  including the effects of interest rate swaps see discussion in item a 
below  was approximately and our overall weighted average borrowing rate  after taking into account amounts outstanding under our senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes  was approximately 
the overall weighted average borrowing rate for eoc  which would exclude the senior discount notes  was approximately 
the debt service requirements of eoc over the next twelve month period net of interest under our credit facility are expected to be million 
this amount is comprised of million for interest under our senior subordinated notes and million for repayment of term notes under our credit facility 
although interest will be paid under the credit facility at least every three months  the amount of interest is not presently determinable given that the credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
ecc has no additional debt service requirements in the next twelve month period since interest on its senior discount notes accretes into the principal balance of the notes until march however  ecc has preferred stock dividend requirements of million for the next twelve month period 
the terms of ecc s preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share on each january  april  july and october while emmis had sufficient liquidity to declare and pay the dividends as they become due  it was not permitted to do so for the april  payment because emmis leverage ratio under the senior discount notes indenture exceeded and its leverage ratio under the senior subordinated notes indenture exceeded ecc s board of directors set a record date for the april  payment  but did not declare the dividend 
instead  a wholly owned  unrestricted subsidiary of eoc made a payment of 
per share to each preferred shareholder of record 
this subsidiary was permitted under the senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes indentures to make the payment to the preferred shareholders 
currently  emmis meets its leverage ratio requirements under both the senior discount notes indenture and the senior subordinated notes indenture 
on july   ecc s board of directors declared the april  dividend  as well as dividends payable october  and january   and deemed the obligation to pay each dividend to have been discharged by the subsidiary s prior payment 
on april   ecc s board of directors declared the april  dividend 
at april   we had million available under our credit facility  less million in outstanding letters of credit 
emmis has agreed to acquire  for a purchase price of million  a controlling interest of in lbjs broadcasting company  lp lbjs owns radio stations klbj am  klbj fm  kxmg fm  krox fm and kgsr fm  all in the austin  texas metropolitan area 
the remaining interest in lbjs will be held by sinclair telecable  inc which will contribute to lbjs a sixth austin radio station  keyi fm 
we expect this acquisition to close in the second quarter of our fiscal as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio and television stations  as well as publishing properties 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
in addition  emmis will have the option  but not the obligation  to purchase sinclair s entire interest in lbjs after a period of approximately five years based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 
emmis has explored the possibility of separating its radio and television businesses into two publicly traded companies 
however  in the current operating environment  emmis does not intend to effectuate the separation absent a significant acquisition of either radio or television properties 
intangibles at february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio and television stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  sfas no 
also changes the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
the company adopted this statement on july  the company has historically used the purchase method to account for all business combinations and the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets that requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets  including broadcast licenses 
under sfas  goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead the recorded value of certain indefinite lived intangibles will be tested for impairment at least annually with impairment being measured as the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and measured for impairment in accordance with sfas in connection with the adoption of sfas effective march   we recorded an impairment loss of million  net of tax  reflected as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the adoption of this accounting standard reduced our amortization of goodwill and intangibles by approximately million in the year ended february  however  our future impairment reviews may result in additional periodic write downs 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations that applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition  construction  or development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
under this standard  guidance is provided on measuring and recording the liability 
adoption of this statement by the company will be effective on march  the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will materially impact the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
effective march   the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets that addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it removes certain assets such as deferred tax assets  goodwill and intangible assets not being amortized from its scope and retains the requirements of sfas no 
regarding the recognition of impairment losses on other long lived assets held for use 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas no 
retains the requirement in opinion to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of statements no 
  and  amendment of sfas no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  and sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
sfas no 
also rescinds sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
adoption of this statement by the company will be effective on march  the effects of this pronouncement will result in future gains and losses related to debt transactions to be classified in income from continuing operations 
in addition  we are required to reclassify all of the extraordinary items related to debt transactions recorded in prior periods  including those recorded in fiscal  to income from continuing operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
sfas no 
requires that the liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  not at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transaction and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
sfas no 
revises the methods permitted by sfas no 
of measuring compensation expense for stock based employee compensation plans 
we use the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 as permitted under sfas no 
therefore  this change did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
sfas no 
requires us to disclose pro forma information related to stock based compensation  in accordance with sfas no 
 on a quarterly basis in addition to the current annual basis disclosure 
we will report the pro forma information on an interim basis beginning with our may  form q 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all of our segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
finally  particularly in our television operations  revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in even numbered calendar years 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operating results  particularly since our senior bank debt is largely floating rate debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage interest rate exposure emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended in june of by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these statements  which were effective for emmis on march   establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
these statements require that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction  and on the type of hedge transaction 
gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in the other comprehensive income must be reclassified as earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item  and the ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized in earnings in the current period 
these standards result in additional volatility in reported assets  liabilities  earnings and other comprehensive income 
sfas no 
requires that as of the date of initial adoption the difference between the fair value of the derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet and the previous carrying amount of those derivatives be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb accounting changes 
on march   emmis recorded the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
which resulted in an immaterial impact to the results of operations and the financial position of emmis 
sfas no 
further requires that the fair value and effectiveness of each hedging instrument must be measured quarterly 
the result of each measurement could result in fluctuations in reported assets  liabilities  other comprehensive income and earnings as these changes in fair value and effectiveness are recorded to the financial statements 
interest rates at february   the entire outstanding balance under our credit facility  approximately of eoc s total outstanding debt credit facility and senior subordinated debt and of emmis total outstanding debt eoc s debt plus our senior discount notes  bears interest at variable rates 
emmis currently hedges a portion of its outstanding debt with interest rate swap arrangements that effectively set the credit facility s underlying base rate at a weighted average rate of on the three month libor for agreements in place as of february  the credit facility requires eoc to have fixed interest rates for a two year period on at least of its total outstanding debt  as defined including the senior subordinated debt 
after the first two years  this ratio of fixed to floating rate debt must be maintained if eoc s total leverage ratio  as defined  is greater than at any quarter end 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements at february  totaled million  and the agreements expire at various dates beginning may  to february  based on amounts outstanding at february   if the interest rate on our variable debt  including the effect of interest rate swaps  were to increase by  our annual interest expense would be higher by approximately million 
foreign currency emmis owns a interest in a hungarian subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency forint 
emmis has a natural hedge since some of the subsidiary s long term obligations are denominated in hungarian forints 
emmis owns a interest in an argentinean subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency peso  which until january  was tied to the us dollar through the argentine government s convertibility plan 
in january  the argentine government allowed the peso to devalue and trade against the us dollar independently 
while emmis management cannot predict the most likely average or end of period peso to dollar  or forint to dollar  exchange rates for calendar  we believe any further devaluation of the forint or peso would have an immaterial effect on our financial statements taken as a whole  as the hungarian and argentine stations accounted for approximately of emmis total revenues and approximately of emmis total assets as of  and for the year ended  february  at february   the hungarian subsidiary had million of us dollar denominated loans outstanding 
no amounts were repaid under the loans during fiscal the argentinean subsidiary had no us dollar denominated loans outstanding during fiscal or at february  emmis maintains no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
