item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tkt is a biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the treatment of rare genetic diseases caused by protein deficiencies 
tkt has received approval to market and sell replagal in countries  principally in europe 
tkt has not received approval to market and sell replagal in the united states 
tkt recorded  in replagal product sales in with the exception of  the company has incurred substantial annual operating losses since inception 
the company expects to incur significant operating losses until substantial product sales are generated 
until such time  the company is dependent upon product sales  existing cash resources  interest income  external financing from equity offerings  debt financings  and collaborative research and development alliances to finance its operations 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was results of operations may vary significantly from period to period depending on  among other factors the timing  receipt  and amount of replagal product sales  continued progress in our research and development programs  particularly is  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of our clinical trials  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  and tkt s ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements 
corporate reorganization in february  tkt s board of directors appointed michael j 
astrue as president and chief executive officer of the company and a member of the board of directors 
mr 
astrue replaced richard f selden  md  phd  who resigned from tkt and tkt s board of directors 
the board also named david d 
pendergast to the newly created position of executive vice president  operations 
dr 
pendergast was previously senior vice president  technical operations 
upon the appointment of mr 
astrue  tkt announced a major reorganization in an effort to reduce costs and narrow the scope of the company s research initiatives 
under this reorganization  tkt plans to focus its research  development  and commercialization efforts primarily on therapeutics for the treatment of rare genetic diseases caused by protein deficiencies 
the company is seeking collaborative partners for its gene activated versions of proteins that would compete with proteins currently being marketed by third parties and for its gene therapy development programs 
during the first quarter of  tkt reduced its us headcount by approximately employees 
eighty employees were involuntarily terminated and the balance of these positions were reduced through attrition 
tkt intends to continue to reduce headcount through attrition  with the goal of having approximately full time us employees by the end of as of march   tkt had full time us employees 
tkt expects to consolidate facilities and is seeking to sublease four of its facilities  including office  laboratory and manufacturing space 
in addition  the company plans to sell its manufacturing facility in randolph  massachusetts 
the company expects that its employee related and facility consolidation restructuring actions will be substantially completed by the fourth quarter of and will record restructuring charges in connection with the reorganization during in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
included in the charges will be amounts for severance costs  for ongoing lease obligations for properties which will no longer be used  and for the write off of property and equipment at facilities which are held for sublease or sale 
in march  the company will record approximately  to  in restructuring charges  which will include severance costs for employees and the liability for the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated sublease rentals for a vacated facility 
in addition  during the second quarter of and beyond  the company expects to incur additional restructuring charges in connection with consolidation of facilities the company currently occupies 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires tkt to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  tkt evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and inventory 
tkt bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while tkt s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to tkt s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  tkt believes the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company recorded its first product sales from the sale of replagal in europe in in europe and in some other countries outside of the united states  collection is  in most instances  reasonably assured once reimbursement agreements and pricing arrangements are established and formalized  as these agreements establish the relevant governmental agency s intent to pay  or once there are legally binding purchase agreements between a hospital and the company  or once approval has been granted for the reimbursement of cost for individual patients 
the company only records revenues in those countries for which one of the conditions set forth in the previous sentence has been met 
if any of the above circumstances were to change  it could affect the company s revenue recognition in future periods 
in the european pharmaceutical industry  it is common practice that customers  principally hospitals  have a general right of return on purchases of product 
to date  the company has not had any sales returns 
the company generally ships small quantities of replagal to customers on the basis of firm purchase orders 
the customers generally order replagal for specific patients  and the drug is typically utilized within one month of receipt 
in part due to the expensive price of the drug  customers maintain very small inventories of it  typically less than one month 
because of these circumstances  the company expects that it will have no or minimal returns in the future and  accordingly  has not recorded a reserve for sales returns and allowances in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
if any product is returned  the company may need to record reserves for sales returns and allowances and incur charges to revenues in future periods 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical 
replagal inventory produced before product approval in august was expensed as a research and development cost 
replagal inventory balances as of december  consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
in general  the company s manufacturing process consists of two distinct phases the cell culture fermentation phase and the protein purification phase 
once the cell culture fermentation phase is completed  unpurified bulk product to be purified is frozen 
upon completion of the bulk process  replagal inventory has a shelf life of up to one year before the product is filled in finished goods vials  and an additional two years once in finished goods vials 
the company s estimates relating to the current demand for replagal and future sales projections indicate that all of the inventory will be utilized within the designated shelf lives of both unpurified bulk product and finished goods vials 
if actual product sales differ from the company s projections  inventory may not be fully utilized 
as a result  the company would need to write down the value of such inventory to its fair market  value which would be recorded as additional cost of goods sold 
asset impairment the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment indicators at each reporting period in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that an impairment indicator existed with respect to a manufacturing facility 
an undiscounted cash flow analysis confirmed the impairment  and the company obtained an appraisal of the manufacturing facility to determine its fair market value 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  at december   based upon the difference between the fair market value of the facility and its carrying value at such date 
the company is actively seeking a buyer for this facility 
upon a sale of the facility  any difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the facility will be recognized as an impairment charge  or credit  in the period of the sale 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
results of operations revenues product sales for the years ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
no sales were recorded in substantially all replagal product sales were in europe 
prior to product approval in august  product sales were made in europe under compassionate use programs 
compassionate use programs in certain countries in europe allow limited sales of products that have not yet been approved by the appropriate regulatory agency 
the increase in sales in reflects the successful launch of the product  the availability of replagal for sale in many countries for the entire year  the receipt of pricing and reimbursement in additional countries  and additional patients commencing therapy 
in addition  while local currency pricing is fixed  foreign exchange fluctuations caused an increase in the us dollar denominated average selling prices 
foreign currency fluctuations increased sales and gross margins by approximately  license and research revenues totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in   and license and research revenues were earned under the company s collaborative agreements with sumitomo and wyeth  as reimbursement of research and development services performed by the company 
in  license and research revenue included a  milestone payment relating to the filing of an ind for replagal in japan 
in  license and research revenues also included a  milestone payment earned under the company s collaborative agreement with aventis in connection with the submission of a bla to the fda for the approval of dynepo 
the decrease in license and research revenues from period to period was due to the timing of completion of obligations related to each collaborative agreement 
at wyeth s request  the company and wyeth are negotiating a termination of their collaboration 
cost of goods sold for the years ended december  and  cost of goods sold was  and  or and of product sales  respectively 
inventory and components of inventory  which were previously expensed as a research and development cost prior to marketing approval of replagal in august  were sold in and in the first half of as of june   this inventory had been fully utilized 
as a result  gross margins beginning in the second half of reflect full production costs 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a charge of  or of product sales  related to the termination of a contract manufacturer of bulk drug substance of replagal 
this charge is included in cost of goods sold 
the company expects that the cost of goods sold percentage for will be approximately to of product sales 
to date  the company has relied on contract manufacturing arrangements with third parties for the production of replagal for commercial sale 
these third parties manufacture replagal bulk drug substance and perform fill and finish services 
in february  the company filed with european regulatory authorities for approval to manufacture the bulk drug substance of replagal at the company s manufacturing facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
in january  the company terminated its agreement with a third party manufacturer of the bulk drug substance of replagal  to be effective in july the company plans to use its existing inventory and additional inventory manufactured under the third party contract manufacturing arrangement to supply customer orders for replagal at least until such time as the company receives approval to manufacture replagal at its cambridge  massachusetts facility  if at all  or such time as the company is able to make other manufacturing arrangements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled  in  as compared to  in and  in the increase in of  or  was primarily due to increases in research and development staffing and manufacturing development costs 
in addition  in november  the company occupied a new combined headquarters and research and development facility  which increased its research and development occupancy costs in by  in  the company also incurred expenditures totaling  related to set up and technology transfer fees paid to a contract manufacturer 
the increase in of  or  was primarily due to increases in external development and clinical trial expenditures  manufacturing costs and research and development staffing  as the company expanded its product development programs  particularly for replagal and is 
the company began to capitalize replagal production costs as inventory during the third quarter of  following regulatory approval of replagal in europe 
the company capitalized  and  of replagal production costs as inventory during and  respectively  that  prior to product approval  would have been classified as a research and development expense 
as part of its reorganization in  the company does not intend to engage in any further product development activities related to its gene activated versions of proteins that would compete with proteins currently being marketed by third parties and its gene therapy programs  unless those activities are funded under a collaboration agreement with a third party 
as a result  the company expects its research and development expenses to decrease in the company s two largest research and development programs  replagal  enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of fabry disease  and is  enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of hunter syndrome  represent the majority of the company s research and development spending 
the expenses associated with these programs totaled approximately of total research and development expenses for the year ended december  and and of total research and development expenses for the corresponding periods in and  respectively 
expenses associated with the company s preclinical and clinical programs related to the company s products for the treatment of other rare genetic diseases  gene activated versions of proteins that would compete with proteins currently being marketed by third parties  and its gene therapy programs accounted for the balance of the company s research and development expenses for these years 
research and development expenses for the replagal program totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of  or  in was due primarily to an increase in expenditures related to the continued development of internal manufacturing capability 
the increase in of  or  was due primarily to increases in clinical trial costs related primarily to phase ii iii studies and to contract manufacturing costs incurred prior to replagal approval 
costs for the replagal program primarily consist of costs of clinical trials  manufacturing costs of clinical supplies  and regulatory costs associated with the preparation of worldwide product marketing applications 
the amount of future research and development expenses associated with the replagal program is not reasonably certain as these costs are dependent principally upon the extent of manufacturing development efforts to build internal manufacturing infrastructure  the regulatory process and information required by regulatory agencies  additional clinical trial expenditures required by regulatory agencies  and the timing of obtaining marketing authorization in the united states and other countries  if granted 
research and development expenses for the is program equaled   and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases of  or  and  or  for and  respectively  were due to expenditures related to the company s phase i ii clinical trial of is that it conducted in and  including the manufacture of clinical supplies 
based on results of the phase i ii trial completed during  the company intends to begin a pivotal clinical trial of is in the second half of future research and development costs for the is program are not reasonably certain because such costs are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of the pivotal clinical trial and any additional clinical trials  uncertainties in the timing of the regulatory process  and the costs associated with large scale manufacture of is 
the company expects  however  that these costs will be significant and are likely to increase each year until such time  if ever  as marketing approvals are received  which the company believes will not be earlier than intellectual property license expense in june  the company obtained an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications from cell genesys  inc related to cell genesys approach to gene activation 
during the second quarter of  the company incurred a license fee expense of  which was funded with  in cash and  worth of shares of the company s common stock 
as part of the arrangement  the company agreed that the number of shares of common stock initially issued to cell genesys would be adjusted at the time the company registered such shares for resale under the securities act of  if the market value of such shares at that time was greater or less than  as calculated in accordance with a predetermined formula 
pursuant to the formula  at december  with the closing price of the company s common stock of per share  the company would have been required to issue to cell genesys an additional  shares of its common stock 
as a result  the company recorded an additional license fee expense of  in the fourth quarter of in january  the company and cell genesys renegotiated the consideration paid for the license  and the company repurchased the shares of stock issued to cell genesys for  in cash 
the company will incur an additional license expense of approximately  in the first quarter of to cover the decline in the market value of the company s stock and the repurchase of the original shares issued to cell genesys 
the repurchased shares will be recorded as treasury stock 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the increases of  or  and  or  for and  respectively  reflect costs incurred in preparation for the launch of replagal in europe and other countries and the creation of a commercial infrastructure including sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses related to the preparation of the launch of replagal and the creation of a commercial operations infrastructure both in the united states and europe amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company anticipates expenses related to the expansion of us commercial operations will be significantly reduced in  given the uncertain us regulatory status of replagal 
legal expenses related to the company s litigation with genzyme totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses related to the company s new corporate headquarters amounted to  the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses related to this new facility will increase in  primarily as a result of a full year of occupancy costs related to it 
impairment charge in january  the company purchased a manufacturing facility  which it intended to use to manufacture one or more of its potential products 
in the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that an impairment indicator existed in regard to the facility  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and thus evaluated the asset for impairment 
an undiscounted cash flow analysis confirmed the impairment  and the company obtained an appraisal of the manufacturing facility to determine its fair market value  which indicated that the fair value of the facility was substantially lower than its carrying value 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  at december   based upon the difference between the fair market value of the facility and its carrying value at such date 
the facility will be classified as a held for sale asset in accordance with sfas no 
beginning in the first quarter of gain on sale of investment in  tkt made a strategic equity investment of  in a european biotechnology company  which was sold in  resulting in a realized gain of  net interest income net interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the average cash and marketable securities balances were   and  in  and  respectively 
despite higher average cash and marketable securities balances in and  interest income decreased by  and  from the comparable periods ended december  and  respectively  as a result of significantly lower rates of return 
net loss the company had a net loss of   and  in  and  respectively 
basic and diluted net loss per share was for the year ended december   as compared to a basic and diluted net loss per share of for and for included in the loss for the year ended december  is an intellectual property license fee expense of  and an asset impairment charge of  which together contributed and  respectively  to basic and diluted net loss per share 
for the years ended december   and  weighted average shares outstanding were   and  respectively 
the increase in weighted average shares outstanding reflects the sale of  common shares from the company s public offerings of common stock in june and december and the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the conversion of all of the then outstanding series a convertible preferred stock in november liquidity and sources of capital since its inception  tkt has financed its operations through the sale of common and preferred stock  borrowings under debt agreements  revenues from collaborative agreements  interest income and  more recently  with proceeds from product sales 
in the near term  tkt expects to finance its operations principally from existing cash and cash equivalents and from continued sales of replagal 
cash flows the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  at december   including restricted marketable securities collateralizing letters of credit totaling  cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in united states government and agency obligations and money market funds 
the company s cash requirements for operating activities  financing activities and investment activities have significantly exceeded its internally generated funds 
the company expects that its cash requirements for such activities will continue to significantly exceed its internally generated funds until it is able to generate substantial product sales 
the company used net cash of  in operating activities in this consisted of a net loss of  combined with increases in accounts receivable of  and inventory of  which was partly offset by non cash adjustments of  taken in connection with an impairment charge relating to one of the company s manufacturing facilities   for depreciation and amortization and  relating to the company s license agreement with cell genesys 
the company required significant working capital in connection with the sale of replagal in and expects its working capital requirements to increase in the company s accounts receivable balances were  and  at december  and  respectively 
the growth at december  was due to higher replagal sales in europe in in certain european countries  customary payment terms on accounts receivable are significantly longer than in the united states  particularly for orphan drug indications 
in some cases  the company expects it could receive payments in excess of one year from the invoice date 
the company monitors its days sales outstanding with such customers in these countries  and  to date  these customers have been paying within the customary payment terms 
if sales in these european countries continue to increase relative to total accounts receivable  the company expects its days sales outstanding to increase accordingly 
the company used net cash of  in for property and equipment  primarily related to leasehold improvements and equipment for the company s manufacturing and research and development facilities 
the company expects to use up to approximately  for purchases of property and equipment in  principally for expanding its internal manufacturing capabilities 
the company will require substantial additional funds to support its research and development programs  acquisition of technologies  preclinical and clinical testing of its products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  expansion of internal manufacturing capabilities  selling  general and administrative expenses  and the buyout of the minority interests in tkt europe  if applicable  as discussed below 
the company expects that its existing capital resources  together with anticipated proceeds from product sales and interest income  will be sufficient to fund its operations into the company may pursue opportunities to obtain additional external financing in the future through equity financings  debt financings  lease arrangements related to facilities and capital equipment  and collaborative research agreements 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon equity and debt market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on the company s continued progress in its preclinical and clinical development programs  and the extent of its commercial success 
there can be no assurance that external funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than year years years after years total in thousands non cancelable operating leases     purchase commitments   total contractual cash obligations    at december   the company had committed to pay approximately  to a contract manufacturer of replagal bulk drug substance for the purchase of additional inventory of replagal through july of which  was included in accrued expenses as of december  the company also is subject to the potential commitments discussed in the following two paragraphs that are not included in the above table tkt europe in april  the company established tkt europe for the purpose of marketing  selling and distributing replagal in europe 
under the stockholders agreement for tkt europe  the company is entitled to purchase the european stockholders ownership interest in tkt europe in august  for a price determined in accordance with a formula 
should the company not exercise that right  the european stockholders of tkt europe can require the company to purchase the european stockholders ownership interest sixty days thereafter 
the buyout price is equal to a of the operating profits  as defined in the stockholders agreement  for the period from september  to august   multiplied by a buyout factor of four  subject to adjustment  plus b of the accumulated positive earnings of tkt europe 
as a result  the amount of the buyout price is dependent on the profits of tkt europe and the commercial success of replagal in europe 
these profits cannot be estimated at this time 
however  the company expects the buyout price to be substantial 
cell genesys in june  the company obtained an exclusive license to certain patent and patent applications from cell genesys related to cell genesys approach to gene activation 
the company funded this agreement with  cash in june and an additional  in january if cell genesys achieves all the milestone related to patent matters under the license agreement  the company will be obligated to pay cell genesys an aggregate of  funded in part in cash and in part in stock 
the company is not required to make royalty payments to cell genesys 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various times through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of loss carryforwards and tax credits  the company has fully reserved against any potential tax benefit 
the future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to limitation under the changes in stock ownership rules of the internal revenue code 
because of this limitation  it is possible that taxable income in future years  which would otherwise be offset by net operating losses  will not be offset and  therefore  will be subject to tax 
litigation expenses in the first quarter of  at least nine purported class action suits were brought in the us district court of massachusetts against the company  its former chief executive officer  and in some cases  its chairman of the board of directors 
the complaints generally allege that  during the period from january through january  tkt made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information concerning the status and progress for obtaining us marketing approval of replagal 
the company expects that expenses related to this litigation will be significant 
the company has been engaged in patent litigation with genzyme and mount sinai with respect to replagal 
through december   the company had incurred approximately  in litigation expenses associated with the replagal litigation 
the company and aventis have been involved in patent infringement actions with amgen and kirin amgen with respect to dynepo 
the litigation is costly and the company is required to reimburse aventis  which is paying the litigation expenses  for of the expenses 
aventis is entitled to deduct up to of any royalties due to the company from the sale of dynepo until aventis has recouped the full amount of tkt s share of litigation expenses 
the company currently estimates that its share of the expenses associated with the litigation will total between approximately  and  by the time the matter is finally adjudicated 
the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of these proceedings 
a decision by a court in any jurisdiction in a manner adverse to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in  the company initiated a comprehensive restructuring plan and  accordingly  the application of sfas will have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations in on december   the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition to fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas requires disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while the statement does not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method or the intrinsic value method 
the company adopted sfas in in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a guarantor to disclose the nature of the guarantee  and the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to perform under the guarantee  the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee  the carrying amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee  and the nature and extent of any recourse provisions or available collateral that would enable the guarantor to recover the amounts paid under the guarantee 
fin also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability at fair value for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provision of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin also addresses the disclosure requirements regarding product warranties 
instead of disclosing the maximum potential amount of future payments under the product warranty guarantee  a guarantor is required to disclose its accounting policy and methodology used in determining its liability for product warranties  as well as a tabular reconciliation of the changes in the guarantor s product warranty liability for the reporting period

certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors could cause actual results to differ from those indicated by forward looking statements made by the company on this annual report and elsewhere from time to time 
clinical and regulatory risks we may not be able to obtain marketing approvals for our products 
we are not able to market any of our products in europe  the united states or in any other jurisdiction without marketing approval from the emea  the fda  or any equivalent foreign regulatory agency 
the regulatory process to obtain market approval for a new drug or biologic takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
we have had only limited experience in preparing applications and obtaining regulatory approvals 
in august  the emea granted marketing authorization of replagal in the european union  approximately one year after we submitted our marketing authorization application  or maa  to the emea  and approximately five years after we filed our ind with the fda 
we have also received approval to market replagal in a number of other countries 
we have not received approval to market and sell replagal in the united states 
since we submitted a bla for replagal to the fda in june  we have received two complete response letters from the fda 
in the second complete response letter  which we received in november  the fda indicated that the data relating to replagal which we had previously submitted were not adequate for approval  primarily because of questions concerning efficacy  but that the data would be discussed at a meeting of the endocrinologic metabolic drugs advisory committee 
on january   the endocrinologic metabolic drugs advisory committee convened to discuss our bla for replagal and concluded by a unanimous vote that our clinical data did not provide substantial evidence of efficacy 
the endocrinologic metabolic drugs advisory committee also concluded by an to vote that the renal pathology data presented by us were not adequate to serve as the basis for accelerated approval 
some members of the endocrinologic metabolic drugs advisory committee indicated that we could re examine the pathology slides showing the effect of replagal on the kidney using a different analytical method  and if successful  the data from that re examination might be sufficient to serve as the basis for accelerated approval 
as part of its consideration of an application for marketing authorization  the fda often requests a review of an application for marketing authorization or parts of an application for marketing authorization by an advisory committee of outside experts 
the fda is free to accept or reject the advisory committee s recommendations 
we expect to commence the re examination of the pathology slides in the second quarter of the fda may decide not to approve replagal on the basis of data from the re examination 
although the emea has granted marketing approval of dynepo in the european union  dynepo has not been approved in the united states 
in  aventis submitted a bla to the fda seeking marketing authorization for dynepo in the united states 
the fda did not accept the bla for filing  requesting that aventis provide additional manufacturing data 
aventis has not yet submitted the requested additional data to the fda  and we cannot predict whether or when aventis will do so 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when any of these applications for marketing authorization relating to replagal and dynepo  or additional applications for marketing authorization that we may make in the future as to these or other products  will be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities 
if approval is granted  it may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of the product 
we may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases 
if our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity before us  we may be precluded from marketing these products 
some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process but does make the product eligible for orphan drug exclusivity and certain tax credits in the united states 
generally  if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity means that another application to market the same drug for the same indication may not be approved  except in limited circumstances set forth in the fda statute and implementing regulations  for a period of up to ten years in europe and for a period of seven years in the united states 
obtaining orphan drug designations and orphan drug exclusivity for our products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases may be critical to the success of these products 
our competitors may obtain orphan drug exclusivity for products competitive with our products before we do 
even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any of our potential products  we may not be able to maintain it 
for example  if a competitive product is shown to be clinically superior to our product  any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product 
in august  the emea granted marketing authorization of replagal in the european union 
genzyme s fabrazyme was also granted marketing authorization in the european union in august replagal and fabrazyme were granted co exclusive orphan drug status in the european union for up to years 
both replagal and fabrazyme have received orphan drug designation in the united states 
whichever product is the first to receive fda marketing approval will receive orphan drug exclusivity 
in the event that fabrazyme receives marketing approval in the united states before replagal  fabrazyme will receive orphan drug exclusivity  and replagal will be excluded from the us market for seven years  unless we can demonstrate that replagal satisfies the limited criteria for exceptions set forth in the fda statute and implementing regulations 
if we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements to which our products are subject  we could be subject to adverse consequences and penalties 
the testing  manufacturing  labeling  advertising  promotion  export  and marketing  among other things  of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in europe  the united states  and elsewhere throughout the world 
if the fda approves one of our products  we and any third party manufacturers we use will be required to comply with a number of post approval requirements 
for example  we will be required to report certain adverse events to the fda and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling of the products 
also  quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to gmp regulations after approval  and the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with gmp 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  monies  and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain gmp compliance 
in addition  discovery of problems may result in financial penalties  suspension or withdrawal or an approved product from the market  operating restrictions  and the imposition of criminal penalties 
in addition to regulations adopted by the emea  the fda  and other foreign regulatory authorities  we are also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and other federal  state  and local regulations 
if our clinical trials are not successful  we may not be able to develop and commercialize our products 
in order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our potential products  we and our collaborators will be required to complete extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products 
we may not be able to commence or complete these clinical trials  either because the fda or other regulatory agencies object  or for other reasons 
the results from preclinical testing of a product that is under development may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials 
in addition  the results of early human clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in larger scale  advanced stage clinical trials 
furthermore  we  one of our collaborators  or a regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the trials may suspend clinical trials at any time if the subjects or patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  or for other reasons 
the rate of completion of clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the existence of competitive clinical trials  and the availability of alternative treatments 
in particular  the patient populations for some of our products for rare genetic diseases are small 
for instance  we believe there are up to  patients worldwide afflicted with fabry disease and up to  patients worldwide afflicted with hunter syndrome 
we are currently conducting clinical trials of is for the treatment of hunter syndrome and additional trials of replagal 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and prolonged clinical development 
we and our collaborators may not be able to successfully complete any clinical trial of a potential product within any specified time period 
in some cases  we may not be able to complete the trial at all 
moreover  clinical trials may not show our potential product to be both safe and efficacious 
thus  the emea  the fda and other regulatory authorities may not approve any of our potential products for any indication 
our research and development efforts may not result in products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials 
we expend significant resources on research and development and preclinical studies of product candidates 
however  these efforts may not result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials 
for example  our research may result in product candidates that are not expected to be efficacious in treating disease or that reveal safety concerns 
we may postpone or terminate research and development of a product candidate or a program at any time for any reason such as the safety or efficacy of the potential product  allocation of resources or unavailability of qualified research and development personnel 
recent adverse events in the field of gene therapy may impair our ability to obtain collaborative partners for our gene therapy programs 
we have terminated internal development of our gene therapy programs and are seeking collaborative partners with which to continue to develop these programs 
recent adverse events in the field of gene therapy  although not occurring in our clinical trials  may impair our ability to enter into collaborations for our programs 
in particular  in november  a patient with a rare metabolic disorder died in a gene therapy trial conducted at the university of pennsylvania 
in addition  in october  a french boy developed a leukemia like disease nearly three years after participating in a gene therapy study as a baby 
as a result of these and other events  a number of gene therapy clinical trials have been terminated or suspended in the united states and in other countries  and regulatory authorities have grown increasingly concerned about the safety of gene therapy 
litigation and intellectual property risks we are a party to litigation with genzyme and mount sinai involving replagal which could preclude us from manufacturing or selling replagal 
in july  genzyme and mount sinai filed a patent infringement action against us in the us district court of delaware 
the complaint alleges that activities relating to replagal infringe a patent licensed by genzyme from mount sinai 
in january  the us district court of delaware dismissed this patent litigation 
in march  genzyme appealed the us district court of delaware s ruling to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit  and in january the us court of appeals for the federal circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal 
if genzyme is successful in its appeal  the case will be remanded to the us district court of delaware for further proceedings on non infringement and invalidity issues 
if we were to ultimately lose this case after trial and appeal  we would be precluded from making  using and selling replagal 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this litigation 
as of december   we have incurred million in litigation expenses associated with the replagal litigation 
we are a party to litigation with amgen and kirin amgen involving dynepo which could preclude us from manufacturing or selling dynepo 
in april  amgen commenced a patent infringement action against us and aventis in the district court of massachusetts 
in january  the district court of massachusetts concluded that dynepo infringed of the claims of patents asserted by amgen 
subsequent to the decision  we and aventis  as well as amgen  filed an appeal of the decision with the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on january   the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision affirming in part and reversing in part the decision of the district court of massachusetts and remanded the action to the district court of massachusetts for further proceedings 
in addition  in july  we and aventis commenced legal proceedings in the united kingdom against kirin amgen  seeking a declaration that a european patent held by kirin amgen will not be infringed by our activities related to dynepo 
in april  the high court of justice in the united kingdom ruled that dynepo infringed one of four claims of a patent asserted by kirin amgen 
in july  the court of appeals in the united kingdom reversed the high court of justice and ruled that dynepo did not infringe kirin amgen s patent 
in february  the house of lords agreed to hear an appeal of the decision of the court of appeals 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of either litigation 
if we and our collaborator  aventis  are not successful in the dynepo litigation  we and aventis would be precluded from making  using and selling dynepo in the united states and or in the united kingdom 
we are required to reimburse aventis  which is paying the litigation expenses  for of the expenses 
aventis is entitled to deduct up to of any royalties due to us from it with respect to the sale of dynepo until aventis has recouped the full amount of our share of litigation expenses 
we currently estimate that our share of the expenses associated with the litigation will total between approximately million and million by the time the matter is finally adjudicated 
we are a party to litigation with serono and would be prohibited from selling products using gene activation technology in some jurisdictions in europe if we are not successful in the litigation 
in january  applied research systems ars holdings  nv  a wholly owned subsidiary of serono  commenced an action against us in the district court at the hague in the netherlands claiming that replagal infringes one of serono s european patents 
the serono patent relates to serono s approach to gene activation 
in january  the european patent office revoked the serono patent on grounds of invalidity due to non enablement 
serono has appealed the revocation to the technical board of appeal at the european patent office 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this litigation 
if we lose this litigation  we may prohibited from selling products using gene activation technology  including replagal  in some jurisdictions in europe 
we are a party to several shareholder lawsuits regarding the adequacy of our public disclosure which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
in the first quarter of  at least nine purported class action suits were brought in the us district court of massachusetts against us  our former chief executive officer  and in some cases  our chairman of the board of directors 
the complaints generally allege that  during the period from january through january  we made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information concerning the status and progress for obtaining us marketing approval of replagal 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any of these suits 
if we are not successful in defending these actions  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may become involved in additional and expensive patent litigation or other proceedings 
the biotechnology industry has been characterized by significant litigation  and interference and other proceedings regarding patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property rights 
we may become a party to additional patent litigation and other proceedings with respect to our proteins or other technologies 
such litigation could result in liability for damages  prevent our development and commercialization efforts  and divert management s attention and resources 
an adverse outcome in any patent litigation or other proceeding involving patents could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology or product that is at issue or to license the technology or product from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain these costs more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop  manufacture  and market products  form strategic alliances  and compete in the marketplace 
if we are unable to obtain patent protection for our discoveries  the value of our technology and products may be adversely affected 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our processes and products in the united states and other countries 
the patent situation in the field of biotechnology generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
we may not be issued patents relating to our technology 
even if issued  patents may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  third parties may have filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications 
we may not hold proprietary rights to certain product patents  process patents  and use patents related to our products or their methods of manufacture 
in some cases  these patents may be owned or controlled by third parties 
as a result  we may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to market certain of our potential products 
if licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms  we may not be able to market these products 
if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know how  the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected 
we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology  processes  and know how 
we seek to protect this information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  and other third party contractors 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
if we fail to comply with our obligations under the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from third parties  we could lose license rights 
we are a party to over patent licenses under which we have acquired rights to proprietary technology of third parties  including a license to patents related to is  and expect to enter into additional patent licenses in the future 
these licenses impose various commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  insurance  and other obligations on us 
if we fail to comply with these obligations  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license and we could lose our license to use the acquired rights 
if these rights are lost  we may not be able to market products that were covered by the license 
business risks our revenue from product sales is dependent on the commercial success of replagal 
replagal is our only commercial product 
we expect that replagal will account for all of our product sales into at least the commercial success of replagal will depend on its acceptance by physicians  patients and other key decision makers for the treatment of fabry disease 
the commercial success of replagal will depend in part upon replagal receiving marketing approval in the united states  japan and other countries 
we face significant competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing products before  or more successfully  than we do 
the biotechnology industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology firms  universities  and other research institutions 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do and are conducting extensive research and development activities on technologies and products similar to  or competitive  with ours 
we may be unable to develop technologies and products that are more clinically efficacious or cost effective than products developed by our competitors 
even if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates  many of our competitors have more extensive and established sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities than we do 
litigation with third parties  including litigation with amgen  genzyme and serono  could delay our time to market or preclude us from reaching the market for certain products and enable our competitors to more quickly and effectively penetrate certain markets 
therapeutics for the treatment of rare genetic diseases we believe that the primary competition with respect to our products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases is from biotechnology and smaller pharmaceutical companies 
competitors include biomarin pharmaceutical inc  genzyme  osiris therapeutics  inc  and oxford glycosciences plc 
the markets for some of the potential therapeutics for rare genetic diseases caused by protein deficiencies are quite small 
as a result  if competitive products exist  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
we believe that our primary competition with respect to replagal is genzyme 
replagal and fabrazyme were each granted marketing authorization in the european union and were also granted co exclusive orphan drug status in the european union for up to years 
genzyme is seeking marketing authorization in the united states for fabrazyme 
on january   the endocrinologic metabolic drugs advisory committee concluded that pathology data from the clinical trials for fabrazyme were reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in patients with fabry disease and  therefore  were an adequate basis for accelerated approval 
in contrast  the endocrinologic metabolic drugs advisory committee did not recommend that the fda grant marketing approval to us for replagal 
both we and genzyme received orphan drug designation for our respective fabry products in the united states 
whichever product is the first to receive fda marketing approval will receive orphan drug exclusivity 
once a product receives orphan drug exclusivity  the fda may not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances set forth in the fda statute and implementing regulations 
we believe genzyme s product cerezyme is our primary competition with respect to our enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of gaucher disease 
gene activated versions of proteins that would compete with currently marketed proteins in our gene activated protein program  we are developing gene activated protein products that would compete with proteins that are currently being marketed by third parties 
for instance  in the case of dynepo  competing products are marketed by amgen  johnson johnson  f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
boehringer mannheim gmbh  sankyo company ltd  chugai pharmaceutical co  ltd  and the pharmaceutical division of kirin brewery co  ltd 
in japan 
many of the products against which our gene activated proteins would compete have well known brand names  have been promoted extensively and have achieved market acceptance by third party payors  hospitals  physicians  and patients 
in addition  many of the companies that produce these protein products have patents covering techniques used to produce these products  which have often served as effective barriers to entry in the therapeutic proteins market 
as with amgen and its erythropoietin product  these companies may seek to block our entry into the market by asserting that our gene activated proteins infringe their patents 
many of these companies are also seeking to develop and commercialize new or potentially improved versions of their proteins 
gene therapy our gene therapy system will have to compete with other gene therapy systems  as well as with conventional methods of treating the disease and conditions targeted 
although no gene therapy product is currently marketed  a number of companies  including major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  such as amgen and serono  are actively involved in this field 
the market may not be receptive to our products upon their introduction 
the commercial success of any of our products for which we obtain marketing approval from the emea  the fda  and other regulatory authorities will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community and third party payors as clinically effective  safe and cost effective 
it may be difficult for us to achieve market acceptance of our products 
other factors that we believe will materially affect market acceptance of our products include the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals  the countries in which such approvals are obtained  and the safety  efficacy  convenience  and cost effectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products 
we have limited experience and resources in manufacturing and will incur significant costs to develop this experience or rely on third parties to manufacture our products on our behalf 
we have limited manufacturing experience and in order to continue to develop products  apply for regulatory approvals  and commercialize our products  we will need to develop  contract for  or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities 
we currently use  and expect to continue to use in the future  internal manufacturing and contract manufacturing by third parties to meet our production requirements for preclinical testing  clinical trials  and commercial supply 
to date  we have relied on contract manufacturing arrangements with third parties for the production of replagal for commercial sale 
these third parties manufacture replagal bulk drug substance and perform fill and finish services 
in february  we filed with european regulatory authorities for approval to manufacture the bulk drug substance of replagal at our manufacturing facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
in january  we terminated our agreement with the third party manufacturer of the bulk drug substance of replagal  to be effective in july we plan to use our existing inventory and additional inventory manufactured under the third party contract manufacturing arrangement to supply customer orders for replagal at least until we receive approval to manufacture replagal at our cambridge  massachusetts facility or such time as we make other manufacturing arrangements 
we are unsure when or if our facility will be approved for the manufacture of replagal bulk drug substance or if we will be able to make other manufacturing arrangements 
failure to obtain approval for our manufacturing facilities or to make other manufacturing arrangements before our inventory of replagal is exhausted could cause us to be unable to supply replagal to commercial customers in europe and elsewhere  which could have a material adverse effect on sales and on our ability to attract new patients 
we are investing  and may need to invest in the future  substantial additional funds to build our own manufacturing facilities and need to recruit qualified personnel in order to operate any manufacturing facilities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully build or operate our own facilities  that our facilities will comply with applicable regulations or that our facilities will enable us to manufacture our products at a commercially reasonable cost 
to the extent that we are a party to manufacturing arrangements with third parties  we will be dependent upon these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable government regulations 
for instance  we are parties to several arrangements with respect to various aspects of the manufacture of replagal 
each of these manufacturing arrangements relates to only certain aspects of the manufacturing process 
in the event that any one of these manufacturers fails to or is unable to comply with its obligations under its manufacturing agreement with us and if the manufacturer s failure materially delays the ultimate production of replagal and adversely affects our replagal inventory levels  our sales of replagal could be adversely affected 
there are a limited number of third party manufacturers capable of manufacturing our protein products with a limited amount of production capacity 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate manufacturing capacity for our needs 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain contract manufacturing of these products  or to do so on commercially reasonable terms  we may not be able to complete development of these products or market them 
any manufacturing of our products must comply with gmp as required by the countries in which we intend to sell our products 
before approving an application for marketing authorization for a product  the fda or other equivalent foreign regulatory agency will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured 
if we or our third party manufacturers do not comply with applicable gmp  such regulatory agency may refuse to approve our application for marketing authorization 
once the regulatory agency approves a product  we or our third party manufacturers must continue to comply with gmp 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to maintain compliance with gmp  adverse consequences can result  including suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market  operating restrictions  and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties 
if we fail to obtain reimbursement  or an adequate level of reimbursement  by third party payors for our products  we may not have commercially viable markets for our products 
in certain countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and the level of reimbursement are subject to governmental control 
in some countries  it can take an extended period of time to establish and obtain reimbursement  and reimbursement approval may be required at the individual patient level  which can lead to further delays 
in the united states  the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product 
these third party payors continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
if we are not able to obtain pricing and reimbursement for our products that receive marketing approval at satisfactory levels  our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected  possibly materially 
we expect that the prices for many of our products  when commercialized  including in particular  our products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases  may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products 
for example  have established pricing and reimbursement for substantially all patients receiving replagal in europe 
pricing was initially established as the local currency equivalent of an average of approximately  per patient per year 
the price remains fixed in the local currencies and varies in us dollars with exchange rate fluctuations 
we may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for products for which we seek a high price 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services of the united states department of health and human services has considered proposals from time to time to reduce the reimbursement rate with respect to erythropoietin 
if dynepo is approved and commercialized  adoption by the centers for medicare and medicaid services of any such proposal might have an adverse effect on the pricing of dynepo 
we also may experience pricing pressure with respect to replagal and other products for which we may obtain marketing approval due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and legislative proposals 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount 
we have limited sales and marketing experience and capabilities and will need to develop this expertise or depend on third parties to successfully sell and market our products on our behalf 
we have limited sales and marketing experience and capabilities 
in order to market our products  including replagal  we will need to develop this experience and these capabilities or rely upon third parties  such as our collaborators  to perform these functions 
if we rely on third parties to sell  market  or distribute our products  our success will be dependent upon the efforts of these third parties in performing these functions 
in many instances  we may have little or no control over the activities of these third parties in selling  marketing  and distributing our products 
if we choose to conduct these activities directly  as we plan to do with respect to some of our potential products  we may not be able to recruit and maintain an effective sales force 
currently  tkt europe  our owned subsidiary  markets replagal in europe 
as a result  our ability to successfully market and sell replagal in europe is dependent on the marketing personnel of tkt europe 
we have an equity interest in tkt europe  the european stockholders own the remaining equity interest in tkt europe 
although our consent is required for various significant matters relating to the operation of tkt europe  most day to day operations of tkt europe are directed by the european stockholders 
if we should determine to buy out tkt europe or if the european stockholders exercise their contractual right to require us to buy them out  our ability to successfully market and sell replagal in europe would be dependent on our ability to attract and retain experienced marketing and sales personnel 
we depend on our collaborators to develop  conduct clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals for  and manufacture  market and sell certain products on our behalf and their efforts may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
we are parties to collaborative agreements with third parties relating to certain of our principal products 
we are relying on aventis to develop  conduct clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals for  and manufacture  market  and sell dynepo in the united states and europe  and sumitomo to develop and commercialize replagal for fabry disease in japan  korea  and china 
our collaborators may not devote the resources necessary or may otherwise be unable or unwilling to complete development and commercialization of these potential products 
our existing collaborations are subject to termination without cause on short notice under specified circumstances 
our existing collaborations and any future collaborative arrangements with third parties may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
factors that may affect the success of our collaborations include the following our collaborators may be pursuing alternative technologies or developing alternative products  either on their own or in collaboration with others  that may be competitive with the product as to which they are collaborating with us or which could affect our collaborative partners commitment to the collaboration with us  reductions in marketing or sales efforts or a discontinuation of marketing or sales of our products by our collaborators would reduce our revenues  which will be based on a percentage of net sales by the collaborator  our collaborators may terminate their collaborations with us  as aventis has done with respect to ga gcsf and as wyeth has indicated it wishes to do with respect to factor viii  which could make it difficult for us to attract new collaborators or adversely affect the perception of us in the business and financial communities  and our collaborators may pursue higher priority programs or change the focus of their development programs  which could affect the collaborator s commitment to us 
we may be exposed to product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance 
our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the manufacturing  testing  and marketing of human therapeutic products 
we maintain clinical trial liability insurance and product liability insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable 
this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations 
we may not be able to obtain additional insurance or maintain insurance on acceptable terms or at all 
moreover  any insurance that we do obtain may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  we will be exposed to significant liabilities  which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position 
these liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
financing risks we have not been profitable and expect to continue to incur substantial losses 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we had net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect that we will continue to incur substantial losses and that  until we have substantial product sales  our cumulative losses will continue to increase 
we recorded million in product sales in  and million in product sales in we expect that the losses that we incur will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
we may need additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain 
if we do not obtain additional financing our financial condition will be adversely affected 
we expect that our existing capital resources  together with anticipated proceeds from product sales  anticipated cash payments under collaborative agreements  and interest income  will be sufficient to fund our operations into our cash requirements for operating activities  financing activities and investment activities have exceeded our internally generated funds 
we expect that our cash requirements for such activities will continue to exceed our internally generated funds until we are able to generate substantial product sales 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the timing  receipt  and amount of replagal product sales  continued progress in our research and development programs  particularly is  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of our clinical trials  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  and the cost of buying out the minority interest in tkt europe  if applicable 
if we determine to seek additional funding  we may do so through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain additional financing  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
in addition  the terms of the financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of such stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  or products which we would otherwise pursue on our own 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company maintains its investment portfolio consistent with its investment policy  which has been approved by the board of directors 
the company s investment portfolio consists of investments only in us government and agency obligations 
the company s investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the relatively short duration of the company s investments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
the company does not own derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
accordingly  the company does not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments which would require disclosure under this item 
as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
the company has exposure to currency risk for replagal sales in europe 
pricing was initially established as the local currency equivalent of an average annual per patient price of approximately  the price remains fixed in the local currencies and varies in us dollars with exchange rate fluctuations 
foreign currency fluctuations increased sales and gross margins by approximately
