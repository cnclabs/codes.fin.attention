overview we are a leading temporary healthcare staffing company and the largest nationwide provider of travel nurse staffing services 
we recruit nurses and allied health professionals  our temporary healthcare professionals  and place them on temporary assignments  typically for weeks away from their permanent homes  at hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the united states 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees paid directly by hospitals and healthcare facilities rather than from payments by government or other third parties 
we enter into two types of contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients flat rate contracts and payroll contracts 
under a flat rate contract  the temporary healthcare professional becomes an employee of the hospital or healthcare facility and is placed on their payroll 
we bill the hospital or healthcare facility a flat weekly rate to compensate us for providing recruitment  housing and travel services 
alternatively  under a payroll contract  the temporary healthcare professional is our employee 
we then bill our hospital or healthcare facility client at an hourly rate to compensate us for the temporary healthcare professional s wages and benefits  as well as for recruitment  housing and travel services 
our clients generally prefer payroll contracts because this arrangement eliminates significant employee and payroll administrative burdens for them 
although the temporary healthcare professional wage and benefits billed under a payroll contract primarily represent a pass through cost component for us  we are able to generate greater profits by providing these value added services 
while payroll contracts generate more gross profit than flat rate contracts  the gross margin generated is lower due to the pass through of the temporary healthcare professional s compensation costs 
over the past five years  we  and the industry as a whole  have migrated towards a greater utilization of payroll contracts 
during  approximately of our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients were payroll contracts 
since we have completed five strategic acquisitions 
we acquired medical express  inc in november  which strengthened our presence in the pacific northwest and mountain states 
during  we completed the acquisitions of nursesrx  inc in june and preferred healthcare staffing  inc in november  which strengthened our presence in the eastern and southern regions of the united states 
we completed our acquisition of o grady peyton international usa  inc  ogp  in may  the leading recruiter of registered nurses from english speaking foreign countries for placement in the united states 
we completed our fifth acquisition in april  acquiring healthcare resource management corporation  hrmc  further strengthening our presence in the eastern and southern regions of the united states 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the operating results of the acquired entities are included in our results of operations commencing on the date of acquisition of each entity 
as a result  our results of operations following each acquisition may not be comparable with our prior results 
at the completion of our initial public offering in november  options to purchase  shares of our common stock that we previously granted to members of our management immediately vested 
these options had an average exercise price of which was below the initial public offering price of per share 
as a result  we recorded approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of  of which million was related to these options 
in addition  we also recorded million of non cash stock based compensation expense in the first three quarters of and million for we also retired all of our indebtedness approximately million with the proceeds from and upon the 
index to financial statements completion of our initial public offering 
the retirement of debt resulted in an extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million  net of tax benefits  which was related to the write off of the unamortized discount on our senior subordinated notes and unamortized deferred financing costs and loan fees 
from through  the temporary healthcare staffing industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of  and this growth accelerated to a compound annual growth rate of approximately from to during the most recent quarters  we believe the travel nurse staffing sector s growth rate has substantially moderated from the accelerated pace experienced during the previous two years 
recently  our revenue growth has substantially moderated as well 
during the past few months  certain factors have impacted the demand for travel nurses 
our client hospitals are placing orders and hiring our temporary healthcare professionals later in the placement cycle  and we believe hospitals have increased their efforts to maximize the utilization of permanent staff and the cost effectiveness of outsourced staffing solutions 
critical accounting principles and estimates in response to the sec s release numbers cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance and compensation and related benefits  allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions completed in the past four years 
through december   goodwill and intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over their lives of years and years  respectively 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and performed the transitional impairment analysis to assess the recoverability of the goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we also performed our annual impairment analysis on december  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we maintain an accrual for our health and workers compensation self insurance  which is classified as accrued compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to both health and workers compensation claims and payments  information provided to us by our insurance broker  independent actuarial studies and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will adjust the assumptions utilized in our methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable  considering the 
index to financial statements customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability  payroll and employee related matters and investigations by governmental agencies regarding our employment practices 
as we become aware of such claims and legal actions  we provide accruals as appropriate 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary

liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary liquidity requirements have been for acquisitions  working capital requirements and debt service under our credit facility 
we have funded these requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under our existing credit facility 
at december  and throughout  we had no debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on january   we amended our amended and restated credit agreement to increase our secured revolving credit facility to up to million in borrowing capacity 
the revolving credit facility has a maturity date of december  and contains a letter of credit sub facility and a swing line loan sub facility 
borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at floating rates based upon either a libor or prime interest rate option selected by us  plus a spread  to be determined based on the outstanding amount of the revolving credit facility 
our amended and restated credit agreement contains a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio and other customary covenants 
amounts available under our revolving credit facility may be used for working capital  acquisitions  repurchases of common stock and general corporate purposes  subject to various limitations 
we have relatively low capital investment requirements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  our primary capital expenditures were million for purchased and internally developed software and million for computers  furniture and equipment and other expenditures 
we expect our capital expenditure requirements to be similar in the future  
index to financial statements other than costs related to our implementaton of a new billing and payroll system and costs related to our future corporate headquarters  including leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment  which we expect to range between and million 
see item properties 
our business acquisition expenditures were million in  million in and million in during  we completed the acquisitions of nursesrx and preferred healthcare staffing and in may  we acquired ogp

in connection with our acquisition of nursesrx  we are obligated to make a million payment to the former shareholders 
the first two payments of million each were made prior to december   in accordance with the terms of the agreement  and the final installment of million will be paid on june  we expect to be able to finance any future acquisitions either with cash provided from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  bank loans  debt or equity offerings or some combination of the foregoing 
our principal working capital need is for accounts receivable  which has increased with the growth in our business 
our principal sources of cash to fund our working capital needs are cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operations for was million  resulting primarily from cash earnings generated by us  offset by the growth in working capital 
in november  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to million of our common stock on the open market at prevailing market prices from time to time through december the stock repurchase is subject to prevailing market conditions and other considerations  including limitations under applicable securities laws 
under the terms of the program  we repurchased  shares at an average purchase price of per share  or an aggregate of million  during we believe that cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes
