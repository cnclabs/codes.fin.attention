the majority of our revenue has been generated from customers in the high technology  financial services and healthcare industries 
accordingly  our business is affected by the economic and business conditions of these industries and the demand for information technology within these industries 
macroeconomic conditions were extremely challenging during and  and we expect them to continue to impact capital spending initiatives of our targeted new and existing customer base 
the ongoing terrorism threat and the uncertainty surrounding military action in iraq will likely impact our near term revenues 
in particular  with the current economic uncertainties and their impact on our business in the current quarter to date  we may well experience revenues that are lower than those reported in the fourth quarter of as a consequence  we would likely further restructure our operations to lower our future break even point and preserve our cash 
as a result of current economic uncertainties  we will be focused on the following objectives in the near term successful rebuilding of our direct sales force  which began in  managing our costs  with potential further restructuring  to allow our return to profitability and allow us to preserve our cash  sales management aimed at focusing our resources and efforts on the opportunities with the highest probability of success  maximizing the value of our partnerships with key system integration and technology vendors  aggressive marketing of our recent major product releases on the windows nt microsoft backoffice and oracle unix platforms  and maintaining high customer satisfaction levels 
we hope that  by focusing our efforts on these key objectives  we will be able to return to profitability in challenging economic times and successfully grow our business  although we cannot offer any assurance regarding when  or whether  this will occur 
we continue to align costs and expenses to our expected revenues 
we may  however  continue to experience losses and negative cash flows in the near term  even if sales of our products and services grow 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex and often subject to interpretation 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software companies  including statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and related interpretations  including technical practice aids 
we generate revenue through two sources a software license revenue and b support and service revenue 
software license revenue is generated from licensing the rights to use our products directly to end users and vsps  and indirectly through vars  and  to a lesser extent  through third party products we distribute 
support and service revenue is generated from sales of customer support services maintenance contracts  consulting services and training services performed for customers that license our products 
license revenue is recognized when a noncancellable license agreement becomes effective as evidenced by a signed contract  the product has been shipped  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  or consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change once the element is sold separately 
standard terms for license agreements call for payment within days 
probability of collection is based on the assessment of the customer s financial condition through the review of its current financial statements or credit reports 
for follow on sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also used to evaluate probability of collection 
revenue from distribution agreements with vars is typically recognized upon the earlier of receipt of cash from the var or identification of an end user 
in the latter case  probability of collection is evaluated based on the creditworthiness of the var 
our agreements with customers  vsps and vars do not contain product return rights 

table of contents revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenue is primarily related to implementation services performed on a time and materials basis or  in certain situations  on a fixed fee basis  under separate service arrangements 
implementation services are periodically performed under fixed fee arrangements and  in such cases  consulting revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as services are performed 
standard terms for renewal of maintenance arrangements  consulting services and training services call for payment within days 
revenue consisting of fees from licenses sold together with consulting services is generally recognized upon shipment of the software  provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees do not depend on the performance of the services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees depends on the performance of the services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if a nonstandard acceptance period is provided  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance and the expiration of the acceptance period 
allowance for doubtful accounts a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
although no expenses were required in  as existing allowances were sufficient to cover accounts written off  significant expenses were recorded to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in prior years due to the rapid downturn in the economy  and in the technology sector in particular  and we may record additional expenses in the future 
impairment of intangible assets we periodically evaluate intangible asset valuations of businesses we acquired as impairment indicators arise 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
restructuring during and  we recorded significant write offs and accruals in connection with our restructuring program under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
these write offs and accruals include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations related to excess leased facilities and other contracts 
although we believe that we have made reasonable estimates of our restructuring costs in calculating these write offs and accruals  the actual costs could differ from these estimates 
with the contractual settlement of the majority of our excess facilities  the range of outcomes that must be estimated has narrowed significantly  except for the value assigned to the warrants issued in connection with the settlement  which will fluctuate in the future based on our stock price 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability is 
table of contents incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to class action lawsuits and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
investment losses and impairment during and  we invested in a small number of private companies 
one of these investments was accounted for using the equity method of accounting due to our ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee  and losses were recorded to the extent of our investment 
the remaining private equity investments are accounted for on a cost basis due to the fact that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee and our ownership interest is less than 
under the cost method of accounting  investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments 
we periodically evaluate whether the declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
this evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors by members of senior management  including a review of the investee s financial condition  results of operations  operating trends and other financial ratios 
we further consider the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee  as well as market prices of comparable public companies 
we generally require our private investees to deliver monthly  quarterly and annual financial statements to assist in reviewing relevant financial data and in determining whether such data may indicate other than temporary declines in fair value below our accounting basis 
we generally consider a decline to be an other than temporary impairment if the estimated value is less than our accounting basis for two consecutive quarters  absent evidence to the contrary 
the carrying value of these investments is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled  at december  and december  acquisitions of versametrix  market solutions  csn computer consulting and revenuelab in august  we acquired versametrix  a privately held developer of a comprehensive  browser based personalization framework and an internet based business intelligence solution

onyx japan in september  we entered into a joint venture with softbank investment corporation and prime systems corporation to create onyx software co  ltd  or onyx japan  a japanese corporation  for the purpose of distributing our technology and product offerings in japan 
in october  we made an initial contribution of million in exchange for of the common stock of onyx japan 
our joint venture partners invested an additional million for the remaining of the common stock of onyx japan 
because we have a 
table of contents controlling interest  onyx japan has been included in our consolidated financial statements 
the minority shareholders interest in onyx japan s earnings or losses is accounted for in our consolidated statement of operations 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  prime systems may at any time after september   sell its shares to a third party provided that they notify us days prior to doing so 
we have a right of first refusal to purchase any of prime systems shares that are offered for resale at the same price at which those shares are being offered to a third party 
further  either onyx or prime systems may terminate the joint venture agreement at its discretion if onyx japan does not complete an initial public offering on or before july  if prime systems exercises its right of termination for this reason  onyx has the right  at its election  to either a buy prime systems shares at the current fair market value as determined by appraisal or b force a liquidation of onyx japan 
we have entered into a distribution agreement with onyx japan  which was approved by the minority shareholders  that provides for a fee to us based on license and maintenance revenues in japan 
for the year ended december   and  fees charged under this agreement were  million and  all intercompany fees are eliminated in consolidation  however  we allocate of the fees to the minority shareholders 
included in license revenues for the quarter and year ended december  is a sale to softbank commerce for approximately  for software licenses internally deployed to support customer and business partner relations 
softbank commerce is a related party to softbank investments corporation  an entity who owns of onyx japan 
in recent periods  onyx japan has incurred substantial losses 
the minority shareholders capital account balance as of december  was  additional onyx japan losses above approximately  in the aggregate will be absorbed by onyx  as compared to in prior periods 
we restructured onyx japan s operations during the third quarter of  which we expect to significantly reduce our future operating expenses and increase our ability to be profitable and cash flow positive in japan 
nevertheless  additional funding may be required to continue the operation of onyx japan 
if onyx japan continues to incur losses and no additional capital is invested  we may have to further restructure our operations in japan 
results of operations we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful basis to predict our future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by young technology companies  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 
our future operating results will depend on many factors  including general economic conditions  which may affect our customers capital investment levels in management information systems  market disruptions related to terrorism and uncertainty surrounding international military conflict  rate of market acceptance of our crm solution  budget and spending decisions by our prospective and existing customers  customers decisions to defer orders or implementations  particularly large orders or implementations  from one quarter to the next  or to proceed with smaller than forecasted orders or implementations  level of purchases by our existing customers  including additional license and maintenance revenues

table of contents revenues total revenues  which consist of software license and service revenues  decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues in any of these periods 
license fee revenues decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
we believe the decrease in license revenues from to and from to was primarily due to the progressive weakening of the global economy  which has caused a delay in the capital spending initiatives of our prospective and existing customers  particularly in the middle market 
macroeconomic conditions were extremely challenging during and  and we expect them to continue to affect capital spending initiatives of our targeted new and existing customer base 
our competitors inconsistency in delivering successful crm solutions has also resulted in more cautious buying behavior of prospective customers 
support and service revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
of the increase from to  million was due to increased consulting and training services and million was due to increased maintenance and support revenues 
of the decrease from to  consulting and training services decreased million and maintenance and support revenues increased million 
service revenues represented of our total revenues in  in and in we expect to see a reduction in absolute dollars in our support and service revenues in future quarters due to the reduction in demand for our consulting services resulting from the decrease in our license revenues in recent quarters 
in addition  we may experience a decline in maintenance revenues as customers elect not to renew annual maintenance contracts in part or as a whole  primarily due to specific economic circumstances facing each of our customers and fewer new licenses sold in we expect the proportion of support and service revenues to total revenues to fluctuate in the future  depending in part on our customers direct use of third party consulting and implementation service providers  the degree to which we provide opportunities for our partners to engage with our customers and the ongoing renewals of customer support contracts  as well as our overall sales of software licenses to new and existing customers 
revenues outside of north america decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in we believe the decrease in revenues from to and from to outside of north america was primarily due to an adverse shift in the buying behavior of our targeted new and existing customer base as a result of economic conditions

table of contents technology decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of 
the decrease of acquired technology was primarily a result of an impairment recorded in the third quarter of relating to the carrying value of the acquired technology asset associated with versametrix 
in addition  the amortization of acquired technology for market solutions was completed in the third quarter of as a result  amortization of acquired technology should decrease in future periods  unless we complete additional acquisitions 
cost of support and service revenues cost of support and service revenues consists of personnel and third party service provider costs related to consulting services  customer support and training 
cost of support and service revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the increase in dollar amount in resulted primarily from hiring and training consulting  customer support and training personnel to support our customer base 
although our professional services headcount had declined at the end of compared to the end of the prior year as a result of our restructuring efforts  the average number of service personnel over the course of was higher than in the increase in was also the result of an increase in the use of third party service providers  which have a higher cost structure than our internal resources 
the decrease in dollar amount in resulted primarily from a reduction in consulting personnel during to more closely align with our service revenue  as well as a decrease in the use of third party service providers  which have a higher cost structure than our internal resources 
cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of related support and service revenues was in  in and in the increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of related service revenues from to primarily reflects a higher proportion of service revenues from consulting and training services  which have a higher direct cost structure and therefore contribute lower margins than our customer support services  coupled with a higher percentage use of third party service providers in our consulting engagements  which contribute significantly lower margins than internal resources 
the decrease in cost of service revenues as a percentage of related service revenues in was due to a higher proportion of maintenance revenue  which has a lower direct cost structure and therefore contributes higher margins than our consulting and training services  coupled with a lower percentage use of third party service providers in our consulting engagements  which contribute significantly lower margins than internal resources 
the cost of services as a percentage of service revenues may vary between periods primarily for two reasons the mix of services we provide consulting  customer support  training  which have different direct cost structures  and the resources we use to deliver these services internal versus third parties 
costs and expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  travel and promotional expenses and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices 
sales and marketing expenses in decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in dollar amount from to and from to was primarily due to restructuring activities and reductions in sales and marketing headcounts  along with a decrease in sales commissions and bonuses 
sales and marketing expenses represented of our total revenues in  in and in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in as a percentage of total revenues is primarily the result of a shortfall in our expected license revenues in the period prior to our restructuring efforts  which were instituted to align our expenses with revenues 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in as a percentage of total revenue is primarily the result of cost cutting initiatives and lower license revenue as a percentage of total revenues 

table of contents to fully realize our long term sales growth opportunity  we believe that we may need to significantly increase our sales and marketing efforts in the future to expand our market position and gain further acceptance of our products 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and equipment for software developers  quality assurance personnel  program managers and technical writers and payments to outside contractors 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the increase from to was primarily due to an increase in the use of outside contractors hired to assist our research and development team in the development of our application on the oracle platform 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in the use of outside contractors upon the release of our application on the oracle platform and our election to retain full time employees in lieu of contractors in our restructuring plan and  to a lesser extent  to a decrease in the number of development personnel 
research and development costs represented of our total revenues in  in and in the increase in research and development expenses from to as a percentage of total revenues reflects the more rapid growth in research and development expenses compared to the growth of revenues 
although research and development expenses were affected by the restructuring  those development projects that we believe to be most essential to our long term growth were not affected 
we believe that our research and development investments are essential to our long term strategy 
to fully realize our long term sales growth opportunity  we believe that we may need to increase our research and development investment in the future in absolute dollars to expand our market position and continue to expand our product line 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related costs for our executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  professional services fees and allowances for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to the hiring of senior executive personnel and employing a higher average number of general and administrative personnel over the course of compared to  coupled with an increase in professional fees 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to restructuring activities and reductions in executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  along with a decrease in professional fees and allowances for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative costs represented of our total revenues in  in and in the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues from to reflects the more rapid growth of general and administrative expenses  particularly in the areas of executive recruitment and allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue  compared to the growth of revenues 
in october  onyx eliminated the role of our president and chief operating officer and we do not plan to hire a replacement for this position in the near term 
the costs associated with the officer s departure were included in our results of operations for the fourth quarter of and approximated  which is scheduled to be paid over the month period ending september  additionally  pursuant to the officer s employment agreement  he received one year acceleration on his employee stock options  all of which had to be exercised on or before january  as the exercise price of these options were above the fair value of our common stock throughout the period in which they could have been exercised  no options were exercised and the options were therefore automatically cancelled on january  we believe our general and administrative expenses may increase in future quarters as we expand our administrative staff  domestically and internationally  and incur additional professional services fees  in pursuit of long term sales growth opportunities 

table of contents restructuring and other related charges restructuring and other related charges represent our efforts to reduce our overall cost structure 
in april  and again in september   we approved a restructuring plan to reduce headcount  reduce infrastructure and eliminate excess facilities 
restructuring charges decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
the components of the charges recorded for the years ended december  and  are as follows in thousands charge for the year ended december  cash payments and write offs balance at december  charge for the year ended december  cash payments and write off balance at december  excess facilities employee separation costs asset impairments other total the excess facility charges recorded in and are the result of our decision to reduce our utilization of certain facilities and to terminate usage of certain domestic and international facilities altogether 
the most significant portion of the excess facility charges relates to our leases for  square feet of office space in bellevue  washington  which were originally contracted to expire in and in recent months  we made significant progress in our efforts to mitigate excess facility commitments 
specifically  in august  we executed a sublease agreement on our  square foot facility in the united kingdom that reduces our obligation on seven of the remaining years on the lease  and in november  we executed a lease termination agreement on our former  square foot corporate headquarters facility in bellevue  washington 
this lease termination resulted in accelerated cash outflows of approximately million during the fourth quarter of we paid our monthly lease obligation of approximately  associated with this facility in january  after which time we relocated our corporate headquarters and no further obligations remained 
the signing of this agreement  which required us to move our corporate headquarters  resulted in accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements and furniture  of which approximately million was charged to expense in the fourth quarter of an additional  in accelerated amortization was charged to expense in january the most significant mitigation of our excess facility commitments was completed in december when we reached an agreement with the landlord of our  square feet of office space in bellevue  washington 
the partial lease termination reduces our excess facilities in bellevue  washington by approximately  square feet 
we continue to lease approximately  square feet at this facility  which began serving as our new corporate headquarters at the end of january the new lease for  square feet expires in december the partial lease termination will result in cash outflows over the next months totaling approximately million 
the new lease for  square feet expires in december in addition to cash payments  we agreed to issue three five year warrants to bellevue hines development  llc  or hines  the landlord of our bellevue  washington facility  for the purchase of up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  including a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
if we either undergo a change of control or issue securities with rights and preferences superior to our common stock within two years after the warrants are issued  hines will have the option of canceling any unexercised warrants and receiving a 
table of contents cash cancellation payment of per share in the case of the warrants  per share in the case of the warrants and per share in the case of the warrants  which  in the aggregate  totals million 
we also entered into a registration rights agreement with hines  pursuant to which we filed a registration statement on february  covering the resale of the shares of our common stock subject to purchase by hines under the warrants 
the warrant value as of december  was estimated at  based on a the estimated value of the warrants using the black scholes model with an expected dividend yield of  a risk free interest rate of  volatility of and an expected life of five years and b the estimated value of the cash cancellation payments in the event of a change in control 
the estimated value of the warrants has been included in long term liabilities 
the termination of the  square feet in bellevue  washington is contingent upon the following conditions  among others  being met as of april  a we are current in our payments under the lease and b we have not filed a bankruptcy or other liquidation petition  or otherwise attempted to reject or contest the lease 
if we are not in compliance with any of these conditions as of april   the original lease will not terminate and we will be required to continue making payments on the excess facilities subject to the original lease 
we previously issued a letter of credit to hines in the amount of approximately  to guarantee our payment obligations to hines 
the letter of credit is secured by our cash deposits 
the letter of credit will secure our obligations under the original lease and the amended lease for the  square feet we still occupy 
the parties have agreed to effect eight monthly reductions in the amount of the letter of credit of  each if i the conditions precedent described above are satisfied by april  and ii we have timely made all of the payments due under the original lease and the new lease for  square feet we still occupy 
in no event will the letter of credit be reduced to an amount less than  our rights to reduce the amount of the letter of credit will be forfeited if  at any time before may   we make any late payment under the original lease or the new lease for  square feet we still occupy  or if there is any default or material misrepresentation by us in any of the warrants or the registration rights agreement 
the accounting for excess facilities is complex and  as a result  may result in adjustments to our current restructuring charge  particularly as it relates to the value assigned to the warrants  which will fluctuate in the future based on our stock price 
future cash outlays are anticipated through july  unless estimates and assumptions change or we are able to negotiate the termination of certain leases at an earlier date 
our contractual lease obligations extend through the current portion of restructuring related liabilities totaled million at december   the long term portion of restructuring related liabilities totaled million at december  and the value of the warrants issued in connection with the termination of certain facility lease obligations totaled  at december  amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles consists of intangible amortization associated with our acquisitions of encyc in  versametrix and market solutions in  csn computer consulting in and revenuelab in amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in primarily resulted from an impairment write down during the third and fourth quarters of totaling million relating to the intangibles of csn  versametrix and revenuelab 
the impairments were determined after both qualitative and quantitative analysis  which indicated that the future cash flows from these business units did not support the remaining carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles recorded from these acquisitions 
amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles decreased in  due to the full impairment of the carrying value of intangibles associated with the acquisitions of csn  versametrix and revenuelab during the third and fourth quarters of  coupled with the elimination of goodwill amortization expense in as the result of the required adoption of new accounting pronouncements effective january   as more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents deferred stock based compensation we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million in  representing the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire shares of common stock during and  prior to our initial public offering  and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the grant dates 
we recorded an additional million in deferred compensation in connection with the options granted to new employees in conjunction with the acquisition of revenuelab in january deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting periods of the options 
we amortized stock based compensation expense of  in   in and  in approximately million of deferred compensation that was recorded in january in connection with options granted to employees of revenuelab was reversed within shareholders equity during and upon the employees termination 
amortization of the deferred stock based compensation balance of  at december  will approximate  in   in and  in other income expense  net other income expense  net consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances  offset by interest expense and bank fees associated with debt obligations and credit facilities 
other income expense  net was  in   in and an expense of  in the decrease in other income expense  net is primarily the result of an increase in bank fees and equity transaction related expenses that were not associated with the sale of securities  coupled with lower interest rates on marketable securities 
investment losses and impairment during  we recorded a loss of  from an equity method investee  which represented our share of the investee s losses of our total investment in this company 
during  we recorded impairment losses totaling million relating to other than temporary declines in three of our cost basis equity investments  based on a review of qualitative and quantitative factors surrounding the financial condition of the investees 
these impairment losses were recorded to reflect each investment at its estimated fair value 
at december   the remaining carrying value of private equity investments totaled  and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of  in  a benefit of  in  and a provision of  in the benefit recorded in resulted from the reduction of the deferred tax liability associated with the intangibles of csn  which was fully impaired during the increase in income tax expense in was primarily due to withholding taxes associated with the settlement of royalties due to our us entity by onyx japan  our japanese joint venture 
although these withholding taxes generate foreign tax credits  we have recorded a valuation allowance for nearly all of the deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance 
our income tax provision or benefit in all periods presented is primarily the net result of income taxes in connection with our foreign operations  offset by the deferred tax benefit recorded as we amortize the intangibles associated with our international acquisitions 
we made only insignificant provisions and recorded no benefit for federal or state income taxes in  or due to our historical operating losses  which resulted in deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for all but  of our deferred tax assets as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance 
minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary softbank investments corporation and prime systems corporation together own of onyx japan  our japanese joint venture 
we have a controlling interest and  therefore  onyx japan has been included in our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
the minority shareholders interest in onyx japan s earnings or losses is accounted for in the statement of operations for each period 
in  and  the minority shareholders interest in onyx japan s losses totaled  million and million 
at december   the minority shareholders remaining interest in onyx japan totaled  any future losses of onyx japan will be shared by the minority shareholders to the extent of their interest in the joint venture 
as a result  additional onyx japan losses above approximately  in the aggregate will be absorbed by onyx  as compared to in prior periods 
in recent periods  onyx japan has incurred substantial losses 
we restructured onyx japan s operations during the third quarter of  which we expect to significantly reduce our future operating expenses and increase our ability to be profitable and cash flow positive in japan 
nevertheless  additional funding may be required to continue the operation of onyx japan 
our joint venture partners are not obligated to participate in any capital call and have indicated that they do not currently intend to invest additional sums in onyx japan 
we are  however  discussing other ways our partners can assist onyx japan 
if onyx japan continues to incur losses and no additional capital is invested  we may have to further restructure our operations in japan

on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  or svb  which superseded the previous agreement entered into in september under the terms of the agreement  we have a million working capital revolving line of credit with svb  which is secured by accounts receivable  property and equipment and intellectual property 
this facility allows us to borrow up to the lesser of a of our eligible accounts receivable based on a borrowing base calculation and b million 
if the borrowing base calculation falls below the outstanding standby letters of credit issued by svb on our behalf  svb may require us to cash secure the amount by which outstanding standby letters of credit exceed the borrowing base 
the amount required to be restricted under the loan agreement was million  measured as of december  due to the variability in our borrowing base  we may be subject to restrictions on our cash at various times throughout the year 
any borrowings will bear interest at svb s prime rate  which was as of december   plus  subject to a minimum rate of 
additionally  the facility requires us to maintain at least million in unrestricted deposit accounts with svb 
the agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenants based on monthly tangible net worth 
we amended the loan documents on july  to revise the tangible net worth covenants beginning with the month ended june  we were in compliance with the covenants  as amended  at december  we are also prohibited under the loan and security agreement from paying dividends 
the facility expired on december   but an amendment  dated december   extends the agreement to march  based on the outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million at december   no additional amounts are currently available under the credit facility 
as of the date of this filing  we are in the process of renewing our loan and security agreement with svb and expect the agreement to be renewed with terms that are acceptable to us 
if  however  we are unable to negotiate a new agreement with svb that has terms acceptable to us  we are unable to maintain compliance with our covenants in the future  or if svb decides to restrict our cash deposits  our liquidity would be further limited and our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed

investing activities used cash of million in  primarily due to the purchase of capital equipment and our acquisition of csn  offset by the net proceeds from the maturity of short term and long term marketable securities 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily for funding leasehold improvements and purchasing capital equipment associated with our new bellevue  washington facility  the lease for which  square feet has been terminated and an amended lease entered into for the approximate  square feet we currently occupy  coupled with cash used to acquire revenuelab  offset in part by the net proceeds from the maturity of short term marketable securities

the termination of approximately  square feet in bellevue  washington will result in cash outflows of approximately million during the month period ending april and is included in current and long term restructuring related liabilities  as of december  we may also use a portion of our cash resources to provide further capital to onyx japan 
if onyx japan continues to incur losses and no additional capital is invested  we may have to further restructure our operations in japan 
finally  it is also possible that we will use a portion of our cash resources to acquire or invest in complementary business  products or technologies  however  we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any transactions of this nature 
assuming our future financial performance is comparable to the most recent quarterly periods reported  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
should our results fall below the most recent quarterly periods reported  we would likely take action to restructure our operations to preserve our cash 
however  due to the potential effect that lower cash balances could have on our sales  we may seek additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources to fund our operations and pursue our growth strategy 
we have no commitment for additional financing  and we may experience difficulty in obtaining additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock and may dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in onyx 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements during  we adopted new accounting standards related to the accounting for business combinations  intangible assets and goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  discontinued operations  and presentation of rebilled out of pocket expenses 
there was no cumulative transition adjustment recorded on the adoption of any of these accounting standards  and the adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows other than the discontinuance of goodwill amortization discussed below  which had no impact on cash flows  but effectively improved our operating results 
the following is a brief summary of recent accounting pronouncements business combinations 
on july   we adopted certain provisions of sfas no 
 although no business combinations have been consummated since june  we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method  thereby prohibiting the pooling of interests method

sfas no 
also requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events 
we have completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test and have determined that there was no transitional impairment upon full adoption in the first quarter of if the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
had been effective in and  net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share would have been a loss of million and per share and a loss of million and per share  respectively

prior to the adoption of eitf issue no 
 we recorded rebilled out of pocket expenses as an offset to the related expense 
comparative financial statements for prior periods have been conformed to the current year presentation 
this change had no effect on operating income or net income for any period presented

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
interest rate risk we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because all of our investments are short term in nature and are classified as cash equivalents as of december  due to the short term nature of these investments  their fair value would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
we do not use any hedging transactions or any financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
foreign currency risk in  international revenue accounted for of our consolidated revenues compared to in and in international revenue  as well as most of the related expenses incurred  is denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding country 
results of operations from our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars upon consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  revenues and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not material to onyx during or in the prior two fiscal years 
at december   we were also exposed to foreign currency risk related to the current assets and current liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries  in particular  our consolidated joint venture denominated in yen 
cumulative unrealized translation losses related to the consolidation of onyx japan amounted to  or approximately of total unrealized translation losses included in shareholders equity at december  although we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  we may do so in the future
