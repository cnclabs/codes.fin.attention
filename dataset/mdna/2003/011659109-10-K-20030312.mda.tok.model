item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for further discussion of perceived trends and factors affecting us and our industry 

table of contents marketing and competition alliances with other airlines alaska and horizon have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges and codesharing on certain flights as set forth below 
alliances enhance alaska s and horizon s revenues by offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage accrual redemption opportunities  gaining us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines  and providing members of our alliance partners frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and horizon while earning mileage credit in our partners programs 
alaska s and horizon s marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time  one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 
if a significant agreement were terminated  it could adversely impact revenues and increase the costs of the company s other marketing agreements 
most of the company s codeshare relationships are free sell codeshares  where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier s flights from the operating carrier s inventory  but takes no inventory risk 
the table below identities the company s marketing alliances with other airlines as of february  codesharing codesharing frequent alaska flight other airline flight flyer on flights operated on flights operated agreement by other airline by alaska horizon major us or international airlines american airlines american eagle yes yes no british airways yes no no cathay pacific airways yes no no continental airlines yes yes yes hawaiian airlines yes yes yes klm yes no yes lan chile yes no yes northwest airlines yes yes yes qantas yes no yes commuter airlines era aviation yes yes no penair yes yes no big sky airlines yes yes no helijet international yes yes no this airline does not have its own frequent flyer program 
however  alaska s mileage plan members can accrue and redeem miles on this airline s route system 
competition competition in the airline industry is intense 
the company believes the principal competitive factors in the industry are fare pricing  customer service  routes served  flight schedules  type of aircraft  safety record and reputation  code sharing relationships  and frequent flyer programs 
any domestic air carrier deemed fit by the dot is allowed to operate scheduled passenger service in the united states 
together  alaska and horizon carry approximately of all us domestic passenger traffic 
alaska and horizon compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of their routes 
some of these competitors are substantially larger than alaska and horizon  have greater financial resources  and have more extensive route systems 
due to its shorthaul 
table of contents markets  horizon also competes with ground transportation  including train  bus and automobile transportation 
most major us carriers have developed  independently or in partnership with others  large computer reservation systems crs 
airlines  including alaska and horizon  are charged fees to have their flight schedules included in the various crs displays used by travel agencies and airlines 
these systems are currently the predominant means of distributing airline tickets 
in order to reduce anti competitive practices  the dot regulates the display of all airline schedules and fares in crs 
air carriers are increasingly distributing their services on the internet through various airline joint venture or independent websites 
the company currently participates in a number of these distribution channels  but it cannot predict the terms on which it may be able to continue to participate in these or other sites  or their effect on the company s ability to compete with other airlines 
regulation general the airline deregulation act of  as amended  eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation 
however  the dot and the federal aviation administration faa still exercise regulatory authority over air carriers 
in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the us  a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot 
subject to certain individual airport capacity  noise and other restrictions  this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the us a certificate is of unlimited duration  but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes  regulations  orders or the terms of the certificate itself 
in addition  the dot maintains jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements  alliance agreements between domestic major airlines  international route authorities and certain consumer protection matters  such as advertising  denied boarding compensation and baggage liability 
the faa regulates aircraft operations generally  including establishing personnel  maintenance and flight operation standards 
domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa 
pursuant to these regulations  we have established  and the faa has approved  a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate that provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft  ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls 
in addition  the faa has issued a number of directives that the company is incorporating into its aircraft 
these relate to  among other things  enhanced ground proximity warning systems  cockpit door security enhancements  mcdonnell douglas md insulation blanket replacement  md main landing gear piston improvements and boeing rudder and elevator improvements 
based on its current implementation schedule  the company is or expects to be in compliance with the applicable requirements within the required time periods 
the department of justice doj has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters 
the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services 
labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act  which vests in the national mediation board nmb certain functions with respect to disputes 
table of contents between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements 
to the extent the company continues to pursue alliances with international carriers  the company may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 
in november  the aviation and transportation security act the security act was enacted 
the security act created a new government agency  the transportation security administration tsa  which is part of the dot and is responsible for aviation security 
the security act mandates that the tsa shall provide for the screening of all passengers and property  including us mail  cargo  carry on and checked baggage  and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft 
the tsa assumed most passenger screening functions in february  largely by contracting with private sector security providers  however  in november  the tsa began performing these functions with its own federal employees 
on december   the tsa began explosive detection screening of all checked baggage 
the tsa also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights 
effective february   the security act imposed a per enplanement security service fee maximum one way maximum fee which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures 
additionally  to the extent the tsa determines that such fee is insufficient to pay for the cost of providing the security measures as mentioned in the previous paragraph  in each of the years  and  air carriers may be required to submit to the government an amount equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in after that  this fee may be assessed based on the air carrier s market share 
in  the tsa began assessing payments under this feature of the security act 
the company paid million to the tsa for this security charge in in addition  the security act requires air carriers to honor tickets  on a standby basis  from other air carriers that are insolvent or bankrupt and suspend service within months of the passage of the security act 
to be eligible  a passenger must make arrangements with the air carrier within days after the date on which the passenger s air transportation was suspended 
because this provision is so recent  the company has little history to determine its impact 
if a major us air carrier were to declare bankruptcy and cease operations  this feature of the security act could have an impact on the company 
to the extent the company is not fully reimbursed for the costs of honoring such tickets  the impact could be adverse 
the dot  under its authority to prevent unfair competitive practices in the industry  has considered the issuance of pricing and capacity rules that would limit major air carriers competitive response to new entrant carriers 
although the dot as recently as declined to issue specific competitive guidelines  it reiterated its intent to prevent what it considers to be unfair competitive practices in the industry  and to pursue enforcement actions on a case by case basis 
to the extent that future dot enforcement actions either directly or indirectly impose restrictions upon the company s ability to respond to competitors  the company s business may be adversely impacted 
airline fares airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation  
table of contents and the industry is characterized by substantial price competition 
the dot maintains authority over international fares  rates and charges 
international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries the company serves 
while air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs  substantial commissions  overrides and discounts to travel agents  brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets 
legislation sometimes referred to as the passengers bill of rights has been discussed in various legislatures including the congress 
this legislation could  if enacted i place various limitations on airline fares and or ii affect operating practices such as baggage handling and overbooking 
effective december   the company  as well as other domestic airlines  implemented a customer service plan to address a number of service goals  including  but not limited to goals relating to i lowest fare availability  ii delays  cancellations and diversion events  iii baggage delivery and liability  iv guaranteed fares  v ticket refunds  vi accommodation of customers with special needs  vii essential customer needs during extraordinary delays  viii flight oversales  ix frequent flyer program  x other travel policies  xi service with domestic code share partners  and xii handling of customer issues 
in february  the dot inspector general issued a report on the various air carriers performance of their customer service plans 
the report included a number of recommendations which could limit the company s flexibility with respect to various operational practices 
in february  a bill proposing an airline customer service improvement act was introduced in the us senate 
in addition  other items of legislation have been introduced that would limit hub concentration  reallocate slots at certain airports and impose higher landing fees at certain hours 
to the extent legislation is enacted that would inhibit the company s flexibility with respect to fares  its revenue management system  its operations or other aspects of its customer service operations  the company s financial results could be adversely affected 
fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the company s financial results because the company is generally required to match competitors fares to maintain passenger traffic 
during recent years  a number of new low cost airlines have entered the domestic market and several major airlines  including the company  implemented efforts to lower their cost structures 
further fare reductions  domestic and international  may occur in the future 
if fare reductions are not offset by increases in passenger traffic  cost reductions or changes in the mix of traffic that improves yields  the company s operating results will be negatively impacted 
airport access many heavily used airports have restrictions with respect to the number of permitted take offs and landings  the total permitted annual seat capacity to be operated at an airport  the use or allocation of airport slots  or other restrictions 
the company currently has sufficient slot authorizations to operate its existing flights and has generally been able to obtain slots to expand its operations and change its schedules 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain slots for these purposes in the future because  among other factors  domestic slot allocations are subject to changes in government policies 

table of contents environmental matters the company is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries 
us federal laws that have a particular impact on the company include the airport noise and capacity act of anca  the clean air act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or the superfund act 
the company is also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the us environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on the company s operations 
in addition to these federal activities  various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
as a part of its continuing safety  health and environmental program  the company anticipates that it will comply with such requirements without any material adverse effect on its business 
the anca recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system 
authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs  including the imposition of nighttime curfews 
the anca generally requires faa approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft 
while the company has had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date  the company s operations at those airports could be adversely affected if such regulations become more restrictive or widespread 
the company does not expect these regulatory matters  individually or collectively  to have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
employees the airline business is labor intensive 
alaska and horizon had  and  respectively  active full time and part time employees at december  wages  salaries and benefits represented approximately of the company s total operating expenses in at december   labor unions represented of alaska s and of horizon s employees 
the company s relations with such labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla 
under this act  the collective bargaining agreements among the company and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date 
if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement  it must notify the other party in the manner described in the agreement 
after receipt of such notice  the parties must meet for direct negotiations  and if no agreement is reached  either party may request the nmb to appoint a federal mediator 
if no agreement is reached in mediation  the nmb may declare at some time that an impasse exists  at which point the nmb proffers binding arbitration to the parties 
either party may decline to submit to arbitration 
if arbitration is rejected by either party  a day cooling off period commences 
during that period  a presidential emergency board peb may be established  which examines the parties positions and recommends a solution 
the peb process 
table of contents lasts for days and is followed by a cooling off period of days 
at the end of a cooling off period  unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress  the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to self help  including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of workers to replace strikers 
a number of alaska s collective bargaining agreements contain provisions for interest arbitration 
under interest arbitration  if the parties have not negotiated the contract by a predetermined date  then such side may submit a limited number of issues to binding arbitration 
the arbitrator s decision on those open points then becomes part of the collective bargaining agreement  and no strike or company self help will occur 
the union contract with the alaska airlines pilots  among others  contains an interest arbitration provision 
alaska is currently in negotiations with the aircraft mechanics fraternal association and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union  representing its clerical  office and passenger service work group 

table of contents alaska s union contracts at december  were as follows number of union employee group employees contract status air line pilots pilots  amendable association international association of flight attendants  amendable flight attendants afa international rampservice  amendable association of and stock clerks machinists and clerical  office and  in negotiations aerospace workers passenger service aircraft mechanics mechanics  inspectors  amendable fraternal association amfa and cleaners mexico workers mexico airport amendable association personnel of air transport transport workers dispatchers amendable union of america twu collective bargaining agreement contains interest arbitration provision 
the agreement coming out of the current amfa interest arbitration may not continue to contain an interest arbitration provision 
horizon s union contracts at december  were as follows number of union employee group employees contract status international brotherhood pilots amendable of teamsters ibt afa flight attendants in negotiations amfa mechanics and amendable related classifications twu dispatchers amendable national automobile  station personnel amendable aerospace  transportation in vancouver and and general workers victoria  bc  canada horizon is currently preparing to begin negotiations with amfa concerning this collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents fuel the company s operations are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel 
fuel costs were of the company s total operating expenses in fuel prices  which can be volatile and which are outside of the company s control  can have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
currently  a one cent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately million 
the company believes that operating fuel efficient aircraft is an effective hedge against high fuel prices 
the company also purchases fuel hedge contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of jet fuel 
due to the competitive nature of the airline industry  in the event of continuing increases in the price of jet fuel  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass on increased fuel prices to its customers by increasing its fares 
likewise  any potential benefit of lower fuel prices may be offset by increased fare competition and lower revenues for all air carriers 
while the company does not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability  dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production  transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel 
in the event there was an outbreak of hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas  there could be reductions in the production and or importation of crude oil 
if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel  the company s business would be adversely affected 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the company s fuel hedging activities 
frequent flyer program all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty 
alaska s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska  horizon and other participating airlines  and by using the services of non airline partners  which include a credit card partner  telephone companies  hotels  and car rental agencies 
alaska is paid by non airline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts 
with advance notice  alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms  conditions  partners  mileage credits  and award levels 
mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards 
upon accumulating the necessary mileage  members notify alaska of their award selection 
over of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to blackout dates and capacity controlled seating 
mileage plan miles do not expire 
as of december  and  alaska estimated that  and  respectively  round trip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the  mile free round trip domestic ticket award threshold 
of those eligible awards  alaska estimated that  and  respectively  would ultimately be redeemed 
for the years  and  approximately   and  round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon 
those awards represent approximately for  for and for of the total passenger miles flown for each period 
for the years  and  approximately   and  round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners 
for miles earned by flying on alaska and travel partners  the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles 
table of contents are accumulated 
the incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead  aircraft cost  or profit 
alaska also sells mileage credits to non airline partners  such as hotels  car rental agencies  and a credit card company 
alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds  and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided 
the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on alaska and as other revenue net for awards issued on other airlines 
at december  and  the deferred revenue and the total liability for miles outstanding and for estimated payments to partner airlines was million and million  respectively 
other information seasonality and other factors the company s results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year  since the air transportation business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the business of the company is somewhat seasonal 
quarterly operating income tends to peak during the third quarter 
the results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions 
in addition  fare initiatives  fluctuations in fuel prices  labor actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern 
no material part of the business of the company and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers 
consequently  the loss of the company s largest few customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon the company 
insurance the company carries insurance for public liability  passenger liability  property damage and all risk coverage for damage to its aircraft  in amounts which  in the opinion of management  are adequate 
as a result of the september  events  aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events war risk coverage 
at the same time  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general 
pursuant to authority granted in the act  the government has offered  and the company has accepted  war risk insurance to replace commercial insurance for renewable day periods until august  in the event the government fails to renew war risk insurance and the company is unable to replace such insurance in the commercial market  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 
other government matters the company has elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet craf program  whereby it has agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military call up 
the government would reimburse the company for the use of such aircraft 

table of contents business risks the company s operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties  such as global and industry instability  intense competition  volatile fuel prices  a largely unionized labor force  the need to finance large capital expenditures  government regulation  potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions 
the september  terrorist attacks negatively impacted the company s business and further threatened or actual terrorist attacks or hostilities involving the us may harm the company s business in the future 
the terrorist attacks of september  and their aftermath have negatively impacted the company and the airline industry  generally 
since a substantial portion of airline travel  for both business and leisure  is discretionary  further terrorist activity connected with air travel  or the threat of further terrorist activity  could result in travelers canceling or deferring their plans for air travel and have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  the temporary shutdown of domestic passenger air travel and reduced demand for air travel led alaska to reduce its flight schedule by approximately and horizon to reduce its flight schedule by approximately 
because a substantial portion of the company s costs are fixed in the short term  however  air group was unable to offset the reduction in customer demand through cost savings  and the company s operating results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree 
in addition  actual or threatened terrorist activity could result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the faa  significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields due to a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel  increase security and insurance costs  make it more difficult for air group to obtain war risk or other insurance  and increase costs from airport shutdowns  flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats 
additional terrorist attacks  the fear of such attacks  increased hostilities or us military involvement in iraq  the middle east or other regions could have a further negative impact on the airline industry and further enhance the risks described above and may also lead to increased cost and volatility in fuel prices 
the occurrance of any of these events could significantly harm the company s business and results of operations 
continued weakness in the general economy  and in the airline industry in particular  could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
vp air group believes that airline traffic  including business traffic  is particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations 
in  weak economic growth contributed to the airline industry suffering significant losses  which are expected to continue in during  both us airways and united airlines filed for bankruptcy 
because airlines operating under bankruptcy protection receive increased flexibility to reduce their costs by voiding contracts and renegotiating existing business obligations  current and future airline bankruptcies could have a 
table of contents substantial impact on industry competition 
in the event airlines who have received bankruptcy protection choose to apply some or all of the cost savings they obtain toward reduced fares  bankruptcy by airlines who compete with air group may cause the company to reduce its fares and result in a substantial reduction in revenue and operating margin 
continued weakness in the airline industry may also result in additional industry consolidation  greater reliance on industry alliances  such as code sharing and frequent flyer reciprocity arrangements  and increased price competition among existing carriers  each of which could dramatically alter the competitive environment in the markets the company serves and harm the company s operating results 
continued weak economic performance in the airline industry may also result in a further reduction in air group s credit rating and make it more difficult for the company to raise capital on economical terms 
any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of a soft economy would harm the company s business 
air group incurred operating losses in each year since and may incur substantial operating losses in the future 
for the year ended  december   air group incurred an operating loss of million 
prior to that  the company incurred operating losses of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the inability to achieve or sustain profitability may hinder the company s ability to honor its existing obligations as they become due  to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on economical terms  and to sustain and expand its business 
the company s indebtedness could increase the volatility of its earnings and otherwise restrict its activities 
the company  like many airlines  has and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness 
due to its high fixed costs  including aircraft lease commitments and debt service  a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 
as of december   the company had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  comprised of approximately million in debt and approximately million of capital lease obligations 
the company s outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit the company s ability to obtain additional financing to fund its growth strategy  capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital or other purposes  require the company to dedicate a material portion of its operating cash flow to fund interest payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  and limit the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including reacting to any economic slowdown in the airline industry 
in addition  the company has an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries  and there is no 
table of contents v assurance that such financing will be available to the company in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
alaska airlines credit facility also contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the company s ability to engage in activities that may be in its long term best interests 
the company s failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of the repayment of all of the company s debts 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of liquidity and capital resources 
if alaska fails to comply with financial covenants  some of its financing agreements may be terminated 
alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements  primarily its million revolving credit facility 
the company cannot ensure that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit the company s ability to finance its future operations or capital needs 
alaska s inability to comply with the required financial maintenance covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and would result in a cross default under its other financing agreements 
in the event of any such default and alaska s or the company s inability to obtain a waiver of the default  all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable 
if alaska did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that become due and payable  it would have to seek additional debt or equity financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if such financing were not available  alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to repossession  which could harm the company s business 
the company s quarterly results can fluctuate substantially 
the airline industry is characterized generally by low profit margins and high fixed costs  primarily for personnel  aircraft fuel  debt service and rent 
the expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried and  as a result  a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing could have a disproportionate effect on an airline s operating and financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on the company s operating results 
in addition to passenger loads  factors that could cause the company s quarterly operating results to vary include the timing and success of the company s growth plans as it increases flights in existing markets and enters new markets  changes in fuel  security and insurance costs  increases in personnel  marketing  aircraft ownership and other operating expenses to support the company s anticipated growth  and the timing and amount of maintenance expenditures 
in addition  seasonal variations in traffic  various expenditures and weather affect the company s operating results from quarter to quarter 
air group tends to experience the highest levels of traffic and revenue during the third quarter of each year 
given the company s high proportion 
table of contents of fixed costs  seasonality can affect its profitability from quarter to quarter 
many of the company s areas of operations experience bad weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft  canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers 
due to its geographic area of operations  the company can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than some of its competitors  which may be better able to spread weather related risks over larger route systems 
due to the factors described above  quarter to quarter comparisons of the company s operating results may not be good indicators of its future performance 
in addition  it is possible that in any future quarter the company s operating results could be below the expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding air group 
in that event  the price of air group s common stock could decline  perhaps substantially 
increases in fuel costs would harm air group s business 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of the company s total operating expenses  comprising of total operating expenses for the year ended december  significant increases in fuel costs would harm air group s financial condition and results of operations 
the company estimates that for the year ended december   a one cent increase in the price per gallon of fuel expense would have increased its fuel expenses by million 
historically  fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand 
fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline 
because of the effect of these events on the price and availability of fuel  the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
in the event of a fuel supply shortage  higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result 
some of the company s competitors may have more leverage in obtaining fuel 
the company may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through higher fares 
to hedge its exposure to fuel price fluctuations  the company began purchasing hedging instruments  primarily crude oil swaps during at december   the company had swap agreements for crude oil contracts in place to hedge approximately of its expected jet fuel requirements 
the company cannot be certain  however  that its fuel hedging contracts will be sufficient to adequately protect it against fuel price increases 
many of the company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a failure to negotiate new agreements  or to do so on terms competitive with the labor costs and practices of the company s competitors  could disrupt the company s business and increase its costs 
as of december   labor unions represented of alaska s and of horizon s employees 
alaska is currently in negotiations with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union  representing its clerical  office and passenger service work group 
horizon is currently in negotiations with its flight attendants union 
labor costs generally are a significant component of the company s total expenses  comprising of its total operating expenses in each of the company s different employee groups may require separate collective bargaining agreements  and may make demands that would increase the company s operating expenses and adversely affect its profitability 
if air group were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of its employees or the company were to experience 
table of contents widespread employee dissatisfaction  the company could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages 
the company could also become subject to protests or picketing by organized labor groups representing its employees 
any of these events would be disruptive to the company s operations and could harm its business 
in the event any agreement the company reaches with an organized labor group requires it to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than those it currently pays or the company is unable to fully offset such increased costs through fare increases  its expenses would increase and its operating margin would be harmed 
the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid environmental change 
the company may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs  or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the basis of competition in its markets changes 
the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares  flight frequency  frequent flyer benefits  routes and service 
the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats 
the company currently competes with one or more other airlines on all of its routes 
many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources  name recognition or lower operating costs than air group 
some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service  reduce their fares or both  in the company s markets 
the company may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that it serves 
in recent years  and particularly since its deregulation in  the airline industry has undergone substantial consolidation  and it may undergo additional consolidation in the future 
for example  in april  american airlines acquired the majority of trans world airlines assets 
in addition  many airlines  including the company  have marketing alliances with other airlines 
among other things  they share the use of two letter flight designator codes to identify their flights and fares in the computerized reservation systems and permit reciprocity in their frequent flyer programs 
any consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry  or the company s loss of key alliance relationships  could result in the company s competitors having access to larger route networks and resources than air group  which  in turn  could increase the risks of competition described above 
the airline industry also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives  such as the bus  train or automobile 
video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lower cost substitutes for air travel 
changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on the company s operations could increase its operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements  both domestically and 
table of contents internationally  that involve significant compliance costs 
in the last several years  congress has passed laws  and the dot and the faa have issued regulations relating to the operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures 
for example  on november   the president signed into law the aviation and transportation security act the security act 
this law federalizes substantially all aspects of civil aviation security and requires among other things  the implementation of certain security measures by airlines and airports  such as the requirement that all passenger bags be screened for explosives 
funding for airline and airport security under the law is primarily provided by a new per enplanement ticket tax  with authority granted to the tsa to impose additional fees on the air carriers if necessary to cover additional federal aviation security costs 
implementation of the requirements of the security act will result in increased costs for the company and its passengers 
in addition to increased costs  the security measures required to be implemented under the security act as well as additional security measures issued by the faa have on occasion resulted in a longer check in process for passengers and caused delays and disruptions in airline service  which has led to customer frustration and may reduce the demand for airline travel 
additional laws  regulations  taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel 
if adopted  these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices  reducing revenue and increasing costs 
the company s insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  and further increases in insurance costs would harm its business  financial condition and results of operations 
following the september  terrorist attacks  aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to airlines for liability to persons other than passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events to million per event and in the aggregate 
in light of this development  under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act  the government is currently offering domestic airlines either i excess third party liability war risk coverage above million  or ii in lieu of private war risk insurance  full hull and passenger and third party liability coverage 
either of these coverages can be obtained with limits up to twice the carrier s pre limits  up to billion 
the company has obtained the latter coverage at twice its prior limit 
aviation insurers could increase their premiums even further in the event of additional terrorist attacks  hijackings  airline crashes or other events adversely affecting the airline industry 
furthermore  the full hull and passenger and third party liability coverage provided by the government is available for renewable day periods until august  while the government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such coverage  the company cannot be certain that any extension will occur  or if it does  how long the extension will last 
it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry  the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government 
significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company s failure to successfully expand its business could harm its financial condition and results of operations 
a part of the company s current profitability strategy involves increasing the frequency of flights in markets it currently serves  expanding the number of markets served and increasing flight connection opportunities 
the company believes that growth will allow it to achieve additional economies of scale and to manage unit costs 
increasing the number of markets the company serves depends on its ability to access suitable airports  facilities and in some cases regulatory approvals 
any condition that would deny  limit or delay access to such airports  facilities or approvals would constrain the company s ability to grow 
in addition  successful growth depends on the company s ability to maintain yields and load factors at profitable levels 
inadequate revenues in new markets may require the company to revise its current growth strategy 
air group cannot be certain that it will be able to successfully expand its existing markets or establish new markets  and the failure to do so could harm the company s business and results of operations 
the company s reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 
an accident or incident involving one of the company s aircraft  such as the loss of alaska flight off the coast of california in january  could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in the company s airlines by the flying public 
in addition  air group could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives  as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service 
airlines are required by the dot to carry liability insurance 
although the company believes it currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice  the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and air group may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident 
substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of the company s related insurance coverage would harm air group s business and financial results 
moreover  any aircraft accident or incident  even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of the company s airlines  could cause a public perception that air group s airlines or the equipment it flies is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives  which would harm the company s business 
the company s operations are often affected by factors beyond its control  including traffic congestion at airports  weather conditions and increased security measures  any of which could harm its operating results and financial condition and results of operations 
like other airlines  the company s operations are subject to delays caused by factors beyond its control  including air traffic congestion at airports  adverse weather conditions and increased security measures 
delays frustrate passengers  reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs  all of which in turn affect profitability 
during periods of fog  snow  rain  storms or other adverse weather conditions  flights may be cancelled or significantly delayed 
cancellations or delays due to weather conditions  traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company s business could be harmed if it is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs 
the company s business is labor intensive  with labor costs representing of air group s operating expenses for the year ended december  the company expects salaries  wages and benefits to increase on a gross basis and that these costs could increase as a percentage of its overall costs  which could harm its business 
the company competes against the major us airlines for labor in many highly skilled positions 
many of the major us airlines offer wage and benefit packages that exceed the company s wage and benefit packages 
as a result  in the future  the company may have to significantly increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain qualified personnel or risk considerable employee turnover 
if the company is unable to hire  train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost  it may be unable to grow or sustain its business and its operating results and business prospects could be harmed or if it loses the services of key personnel 
the company may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and  therefore  the loss of any of these individuals could harm its business

item legal proceedings oakland maintenance investigation in december  the us attorney for the northern district of california initiated a grand jury investigation concerning certain maintenance activities at alaska s oakland maintenance base 
the investigation was expanded to include the aircraft involved in the loss of flight in january the faa separately proposed a civil penalty in connection with the maintenance activities  which alaska and the faa have settled for an agreed amount 
in december  the us attorney notified alaska that the evidence it had gathered relative to the maintenance activities did not warrant the filing of criminal charges  and closed that part of the investigation 
the us attorney also placed the portion of its investigation related to flight on inactive status  with the possibility of reactivating and reviewing the matter when the ntsb issued its final report on the accident 
accordingly  following the final ntsb hearing on the flight investigation in december  the us attorney s office reactivated the matter in order to review it in light of the final ntsb report 
flight litigation alaska is a defendant in a number of lawsuits relating to the loss of flight on january  representatives of all passengers and crew on board have filed cases against alaska  the boeing company  and others

all statements in the following discussion which are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward looking statements 
please consider our forward looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report s introductory cautionary note 
there can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by the company 
actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors  some of which the company cannot predict or control 
for a discussion of these factors  see item business risks 
industry conditions the airline industry is cyclical 
generally speaking  economic conditions were strong during  but weakened during and because the industry has high fixed costs in relation to revenues  a small change in load factors or fare levels has a large impact on profits 
for most airlines  labor and fuel account for almost half of operating expenses 
the relatively strong economy in the late s put upward pressure on labor costs 
fuel prices have been volatile in the last three years 
fuel cost per gallon increased in  decreased in and in on september   the united states was attacked by terrorists using hijacked jets of two us airlines 
the faa shut down all commercial airline flight operations for september and airlines resumed flight operations at reduced levels on september these events  combined with continued slowing economic conditions in  have had a significant negative impact on demand for airline travel 
throughout the industry  airlines continue to cut capacity and have instituted a variety of cost saving measures 
in addition  credit rating agencies have downgraded the long term credit ratings of most us airlines and their related entities  including alaska air group  inc on september   the us government passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act to provide billion of cash compensation and billion of loan guarantees to us airlines 
the purpose of the act was to compensate the airlines for direct and incremental losses for the period september through december  as a result of the september terrorist attacks 
as of december   alaska had recognized million and horizon had recognized million of the billion cash compensation 
during the third quarter of  the united states department of transportation dot completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to alaska and horizon of million and million  respectively 
results of operations compared with the consolidated loss before accounting change for was million  or per share compared with a loss of million  or per share in the consolidated operating loss was million in compared with an operating loss of million in consolidated results in and include million and million  respectively  of government 
table of contents compensation recognized resulting from the act 
consolidated results for include a million charge in connection with write off of all of the company s goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial and statistical data for alaska and horizon is shown in item a discussion of this data follows 
alaska airlines revenues operating revenue increased during as compared to available seat miles asms or capacity increased during each quarter of as compared to due to the addition of service to five cities calgary  boston  denver  newark and miami and due to the negative impact of the terrorist attacks on th quarter capacity 
for the full year  capacity was up while revenue passenger miles rpms or traffic increased at a slightly lower rate  resulting in a point decrease in passenger load factor rpms divided by asms 
in our largest market  southern california  capacity was slightly higher in compared to  and traffic was slightly lower  resulting in a decrease in load factor of points 
capacity and traffic gains experienced in the last two quarters in this market were offset by decreases in the first two quarters 
in our second largest market  anchorage fairbanks to the us mainland  both capacity and traffic increased when compared to  traffic increased at a higher rate than capacity  resulting in a increase in load factor of points for the year 
the average load factor for our newest five cities was better than the system average 
yield per passenger mile was down in each quarter of the year in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
the decrease in passenger yield was due to a combination of fewer business passengers  a drop off in demand due to the events of september  fare sales offered to stimulate demand  and the sagging economy 
for the full year  yields were down 
the higher traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a increase in passenger revenue 
freight and mail revenues decreased 
after september  new security measures had a negative impact on our freight and mail volumes  resulting in a negative impact on revenues 
other net revenues increased  largely due to increased revenue from the sale of miles in alaska s frequent flyer program  and redemption of miles on partner airlines alaska recognizes revenue for the difference between the funds received for the sale of miles to third parties and the cost of the award redemptions on partner airlines 
alaska airlines expenses excluding fuel  operating expenses grew by million  or  as a result of an increase in asms and a decrease in cost per asm 
the cost per asm excluding fuel increased slightly by during the first nine months of when compared to the same period in but decreased by in the fourth quarter  primarily due to the impact of the terrorist attacks in explanations of significant year over year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits increased due to a increase in average wages and benefits per employee and a increase in the number of employees 
the results include a full year of a pilot wage increase which occurred in june  step increases for union 
table of contents employees  and annual merit raises for management employees 
additionally  benefits expense significantly increased due to increases in defined benefit plan costs and increases in health insurance for all employees 
contracted services increased  primarily due to higher rates for ground handling services and a slightly higher volume of services due to capacity growth 
increased airport security screening costs subsequent to september also contributed to the increase 
aircraft fuel expense decreased due to a decrease in the cost per gallon of fuel  offset by a increase in gallons consumed 
fuel consumption rate per flight hour decreased slightly by 
the lower fuel prices saved million 
aircraft maintenance expense increased as a result of more airframe checks in in addition  the results reflect a reduced flight schedule as a result of the september terrorist attacks which resulted in the deferring of certain c checks and heavy checks into commission expense decreased due to the elimination of travel agent base commissions and the continuing shift to direct sales channels 
in june  the company changed its travel agent commissions program to eliminate base commissions and move to a incentive based program 
in  of air group ticket sales were made through travel agents  versus in in  of the ticket sales were made through alaska s internet web site versus in other selling expense consists of credit card commissions  computer reservation systems fees  mileage plan award costs for miles earned by flying on alaska or horizon  and advertising expenses 
the slight decrease in as compared to the same period in is primarily due to increases in credit card commissions partially offset by decreases in crs fees  advertising expense and mileage plan awards 
depreciation and amortization increased in as compared to  primarily due to the addition of eight owned aircraft during the first and second quarters of landing fees and other rentals increased  exceeding the increase in landings  due to higher landing fee and rental rates at airports throughout the system 
the higher rates reflect the airports increased cost of operations due to new security directives and expansion of their facilities 
other expense increased  primarily due to higher expenditures for insurance  flight crew hotels and utilities  partly offset by lower property taxes  recruiting  passenger remuneration  uninsured losses and legal costs 
subsequent to the events of september  the company experienced significant increases in hull  liability and war risk insurance rates  and was also subject to surcharges for war risk coverage 
as a result of these increases  alaska incurred million in aircraft insurance expense in  compared to million in 
table of contents horizon air revenues for the year  capacity was up and traffic was up  resulting in a decrease in passenger load factor 
passenger yields were down in the first quarter  down in the second quarter  down in the third quarter and down in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in business passengers and the economic downturn 
for the full year  yields were down 
the increased traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a increase in passenger revenue 
freight and mail revenues decreased 
in june  horizon ceased carrying general freight in order to focus on carrying higher yield small packages instead 
this change  along with the impact of the september terrorist attacks  led to the decline in revenues 
other net revenues increased  primarily due to manufacturer support received as compensation for delays in delivery of crj aircraft 
horizon air expenses cost per asm decreased as a result of a increase in asms combined with a million  or decrease in operating expenses  excluding fuel and special charge 
unit costs in were adversely impacted by the capacity reductions that resulted from the september terrorist attacks 
additionally  horizon s expenses in were adversely impacted by the delay in the delivery of the crj aircraft from january to july explanations of significant year over year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits remained constant due to the combination of an increase in average wages and benefits per employee and a reduction in the number of employees 
the company recognized a million signing bonus in the fourth quarter of related to a new pilot contract 
excluding that bonus  average wages and benefits were up 
aircraft fuel expense decreased due to a decrease in gallons consumed and a decrease in the cost per gallon of fuel 
the fuel consumption rate per flight hour decreased due to the use of more fuel efficient dash and crj aircraft 
aircraft maintenance expense decreased due to greater use of new aircraft in still under warranty  a decrease in aircraft block hours and higher expenses in related to the phasing out of the fokker f jet aircraft 
aircraft rent increased due to higher rental rates incurred on new dash and crj aircraft rented in and depreciation and amortization expense decreased  largely due to higher depreciation in on fokker f jet aircraft spare parts and airframes which did not recur in 
table of contents landing fees and other rentals increased due to higher landing fee and rental rates at airports throughout the system 
the higher rates reflect the airports increased cost of operations due to new security directives and expansion of their facilities 
other expense increased  primarily due to higher expenditures for insurance 
subsequent to the events of september  the company experienced significant increases in hull  liability and war risk insurance rates  and was also subject to surcharges for war risk coverage 
as a result of those increases  insurance expense for aircraft for horizon in was million  compared to million in the million special charge in recognizes the loss in value of owned fokker f aircraft and related spare parts 
the f s  which are being replaced with more fuel efficient crj regional jets  were completely taken out of service on february  the remaining net book value of these aircraft and related spare parts as of december   was million 
consolidated nonoperating income expense net nonoperating loss was million in compared to nonoperating income of million in the million decrease was primarily due to us government compensation of million recognized in compared to million in in  alaska and horizon recognized million and million  respectively of us government compensation 
during the third quarter of  the dot completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to alaska and horizon of million and million  respectively 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest totaled million in which compares to million in the company has fuel hedge contracts that are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
each period  the contracts are measured and adjusted to fair market value 
the change in the value of the fuel hedge contracts that perfectly offsets the change in the value of the aircraft fuel being hedged is recorded as other comprehensive income loss until the hedged contract is settled and is then recognized in earnings 
to the extent the change in the value of the fuel hedge contracts does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the aircraft fuel purchase being hedged  that portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings 
in and  million of expense and million of income  respectively  was recorded as part of other nonoperating expense to recognize the hedge ineffectiveness on the contracts 
as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  at december   the company has fuel hedge contracts for million gallons of projected jet fuel usage in  which represents approximately of projected usage 
cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  the company s goodwill will no longer be amortized  but instead will be tested for impairment on a minimum of an annual basis 
during the second quarter of  the company completed the first step of its impairment test related to its million of goodwill 
the test was performed using alaska and horizon as separate reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed the 
table of contents second step of its impairment test and determined that all of the company s goodwill was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a one time  non cash charge  effective january   of million million alaska and million horizon to write off all of its goodwill 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for compared with the consolidated net loss for was million  or per share compared with a loss before accounting change of million  or per share in the consolidated operating loss was million in compared with an operating loss of million in the larger operating loss was primarily due to the weakening economy  partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs  and also due to the negative impact of the terrorist attacks  for which the company has been partially compensated by the us government 
alaska airlines revenues capacity increased during the first nine months of due to normal growth  but decreased in the fourth quarter due to the impact of the terrorist attacks 
alaska operated approximately of its previously planned schedule in the fourth quarter 
for the full year  capacity was up but traffic grew by only  resulting in a point decrease in passenger load factor 
in our largest market  southern california  capacity was slightly lower in compared to  resulting in flat traffic and a slight increase in load factor points 
capacity and traffic gains experienced in the second quarter in this market were offset by decreases in the fourth quarter 
in our second largest market  anchorage fairbanks to the us mainland  capacity increased in the upper single digits  but traffic increases were not as high  resulting in a decrease in load factor of points for the year 
our newest market  seattle to washington dc  which operated primarily in the fourth quarter  had an average load factor for the fourth quarter that was better than the system average 
passenger yields were up in the first quarter due to fuel related fare increases implemented in late in the second and third quarters  yield was down and  respectively  due to a decline in business passengers and fare sales 
yields were down in the fourth quarter due to a combination of fewer business passengers  a drop off in demand due to the events of september  and fares sales offered to stimulate demand 
for the full year  yields were down 
the higher traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a decrease in passenger revenue 
freight and mail revenues  which were also adversely impacted by the september terrorist attacks  increased 
prior to september  freight revenues were flat compared to  but mail revenues had increased compared to due to higher yields 
volumes of mail shipped were lower than in  but the rate increases instituted in early resulted in higher revenues 
after september  two security measures impacted our freight and mail business first  the limitation on carrying mail greater than ounces on flights with or more passengers limited our ability to carry mail from alaska to the us mainland 
second  we may only carry freight from known shippers  which negatively impacted our freight volumes 
the effects of these two measures will have a slightly negative impact on revenues in the future 

table of contents other net revenues increased  largely due to increased revenue from the sale of miles in alaska s frequent flyer program 
alaska airlines expenses excluding fuel  operating expenses grew by million  or  as a result of a increase in asms and a increase in cost per asm 
the cost per asm excluding fuel remained constant during the first nine months of when compared to the same period in but increased by in the fourth quarter  primarily due to the impact of the terrorist attacks and labor costs 
explanations of significant year over year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits increased due to a increase in the number of employees combined with a increase in average wages and benefits per employee 
employees were added in most areas to support the net addition of six aircraft to the operating fleet 
the results include a million charge for a flight attendant early retirement program 
the results include approximately million of added expense for a pilot pay increase that was effective june excluding these items  average wages and benefits per employee increased  which was due to increases for union employees  annual merit raises for management employees  and higher pension and health insurance costs for all employees 
contracted services increased  primarily due to higher rates for ground handling services and a slightly higher volume of services due to capacity growth 
increased airport security screening costs subsequent to september also contributed to the increase 
aircraft fuel expense decreased due to a decrease in the cost per gallon of fuel  offset by a increase in gallons consumed 
the fuel consumption rate decreased due to the use of more fuel efficient b and b aircraft 
the lower fuel prices saved million 
aircraft maintenance expense decreased 
as a result of fewer airframe checks in we also incurred lower outside engine repair costs in compared to commission expense decreased  consistent with the decrease in passenger revenue  and also due to a smaller proportion of sales being made through travel agents 
in  of air group ticket sales were made through travel agents  versus in in  of the ticket sales were made through alaska s internet web site versus in other selling expense consists of credit card commissions  computer reservation systems fees  mileage plan award costs  and advertising expenses 
the decrease in compared to the same period in is primarily due to the company recording a charge of million in due to a change in estimate for the cost of travel awards earned by mileage plan members flying on travel partners and an increase in the number of awards that will ultimately be redeemed for travel 
higher costs are a result of increasing 
table of contents the estimated costs alaska incurs to acquire awards on other airlines for its mileage plan members  as well as lower assumed forfeiture miles 
depreciation and amortization increased  primarily due to the addition of eight owned aircraft during landing fees and other rentals increased  exceeding the increase in landings  due to higher landing fee and rental rates at airports throughout the system 
the higher rates reflect the airports increased cost of operations due to new security directives  expansion of their facilities  and increased costs for utilities 
due to the events of september  airports are experiencing fewer landings and lower receipts from concessionaires 
therefore  the company anticipates that these revenue shortfalls will be passed through to airlines via increased landing fees and terminal rents 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expensed million for estimated shortfalls related to other expense increased  primarily due to higher expenditures for insurance  flight crew hotels and utilities  partly offset by lower recruiting  passenger remuneration  and legal costs 
subsequent to the events of september  the company experienced significant increases in hull  liability and war risk insurance rates  and was also subject to surcharges for war risk coverage 
horizon air revenues capacity was essentially flat during the first eight months of  but decreased in september and in the fourth quarter due to the impact of the terrorist attacks 
horizon operated approximately of its previously planned schedule in the fourth quarter 
for the full year  capacity was down and traffic was down  resulting in a point increase in passenger load factor 
passenger yields were down in the first quarter  down in the second quarter  and down in the third quarter due to a reduction in business passengers  and down in the fourth quarter due to a combination of fewer business passengers and lower fares

other net revenues increased million  primarily due to manufacturer support received as compensation for delays in delivery of crj aircraft 
horizon air expenses cost per asm increased as a result of a decrease in asms and an million  or increase in operating expenses  excluding fuel and special charge 
unit costs were adversely impacted by the capacity reductions that resulted from the september terrorist attacks 
additionally  horizon s expenses were adversely impacted by the delay in the delivery of the crj aircraft from january to july the company hired and trained pilots  flight attendants and mechanics  and purchased spare parts in anticipation of the new fleet delivery  
table of contents which was to commence in january 
those preparations increased expenses from the beginning of the year  but the total expected benefits of the new and more efficient aircraft occurred much later in the year due to the delay 
explanations of significant year over year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits increased due to the combination of a increase in average wages and benefits per employee and a reduction in the number of employees 
the company recognized a million signing bonus in the fourth quarter related to a new pilot contract 
excluding that bonus  average wages and benefits were up 
fuel expense decreased due to a decrease in gallons consumed and an decrease in the cost per gallon of fuel 
the fuel consumption rate decreased due to the use of more fuel efficient dash and crj aircraft 
aircraft maintenance expense decreased due to a decrease in aircraft block hours  the greater use of new aircraft in  and higher expenses in related to the phasing out of the fokker f jet aircraft 
aircraft rent increased due to higher rental rates incurred on new dash and crj aircraft rented in depreciation and amortization expense increased  largely due to added depreciation on fokker f jet aircraft spare parts and airframes 
landing fees and other rentals increased due to higher landing fee and rental rates at airports throughout the system 
the higher rates reflect the airports increased cost of operations due to new security directives  expansion of their facilities  and increased costs for utilities 
due to the events of september and the slowing economy  airports are experiencing fewer landings and lower receipts from concessionaires 
therefore  the company anticipates that those revenue shortfalls will be passed through to airlines via increased landing fees and terminal rents 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expensed million for estimated shortfalls related to other expense increased  primarily due to higher expenditures for insurance 
subsequent to the events of september  the company experienced significant increases in hull  liability and war risk insurance rates  and was subject to surcharges for war risk coverage 
the million special charge recognizes the loss in value of owned fokker f aircraft and related spare parts 
the f s  which are being replaced with more fuel efficient crj regional jets  were completely taken out of service as of february  the remaining net book value of these aircraft and related spare parts as of december   was million 

table of contents consolidated nonoperating income expense net nonoperating income was million in compared to million in the million increase was primarily due to us government compensation  partially offset by interest expense 
in  alaska and horizon recognized million and million  respectively of us government compensation  under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act described above under industry conditions 
during the third quarter of  the dot completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to alaska and horizon of million and million  respectively 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  increased million due to new debt incurred during the year ended december  effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the company has fuel hedge contracts that are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
each period  the contracts are measured and adjusted to fair market value 
the change in the value of the fuel hedge contracts that perfectly offsets the change in the value of the aircraft fuel purchase being hedged is recorded as comprehensive income loss until the hedged contract is settled and is then recognized in earnings 
to the extent the change in the value of the fuel hedge contracts does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the aircraft fuel purchase being hedged  that portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings 
in  million of charges were recorded as part of other nonoperating expense to recognize the hedge ineffectiveness on the fuel contracts 
critical accounting policies the company has three critical accounting policies that require a more significant amount of management judgment than other accounting policies the company employs 
they are described below 
mileage plan the company has a loyalty program that awards miles to passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our travel partners 
additionally  the company sells miles to third parties  such as our credit card partner  for cash 
in either case  the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska  horizon  or any of our alliance partners 
the company has an obligation to provide this future travel  therefore  for awards to passengers who fly on alaska  horizon or our travel partners  the company recognizes a liability and the corresponding expense for this future obligation 
for miles sold to third parties  the sales proceeds related to future travel are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided 
at december   the company had billion miles outstanding  representing a liability of million 
the liability is computed based on several assumptions that require management judgment to estimate and formulate 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimates  therefore  an incorrect assumption impacts the amount and or timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan 
table of contents expenses 
the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 
the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel and the miles used per award ie free ticket outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel 
members may not reach the threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel 
therefore  based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts  the company estimates how many miles will never be used  and does not record a liability for those miles 
we also estimate how many miles will be used per award 
if actual miles used are more or less than estimated  we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense 
the costs which will be incurred to carry the passenger when the frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket  incremental costs such as food  fuel and insurance  are incurred by the company to carry that passenger 
the company estimates what these costs will be and accrues a liability 
if the passenger travels on another airline  the company often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger 
the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often higher than the costs incurred by the company to carry that passenger 
the company estimates how much it will pay to other airlines for future travel awards and accrues this expense 
when the award is flown  if the costs actually incurred by the company or paid to other airlines are higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued  the liability may be under or overstated 
redemption on alaska or horizon versus other airlines the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost the company will pay to other airlines 
the company estimates the number of awards which will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus other airlines and accrues the costs based on this estimate 
if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated  the liability may be under or overstated 
the company reviews all mileage plan estimates each quarter  and changes certain assumptions based on historical trends 
in  the company recorded a charge of million primarily due to a change in estimate for the cost of travel awards earned by mileage plan members flying on travel partners and an increase in the number of awards that will ultimately be redeemed for travel 
pension plans the company accounts for the defined benefit pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas 
under sfas  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
the company recognized expense for its defined benefit pension plans of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability 
table of contents amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
at december   the fair value of the company s pension plan assets totaled million 
lower investment returns  benefit payments and declining discount rates have resulted in a charge in the fourth quarter of million net of tax of million as of december  the company anticipates making a cash contribution of approximately million during pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
at december   the company estimates that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of 
this rate is lower than the assumed rate of used at both december  and and was developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments as considered appropriate 
this expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december  is based on an allocation of us equities and us fixed income securities 
decreasing the expected long term rate of return by from to would increase the company s estimated pension expense by approximately million 
pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
the company discounted future pension obligations using a rate of  and at december   and  respectively 
the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality long term bonds 
decreasing the discount rate by from to would increase the company s accumulated benefit obligation at december  by approximately million and increase the estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact the company s future pension expense and liabilities 
the company cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
long lived assets in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the long lived assets condition  and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
due to the events of september and the impact on the airline industry  in the company evaluated whether the book value of its aircraft was impaired in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company performed an impairment test  as required by sfas no 
 which was based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the company s aircraft 
based on this test  the company determined that the horizon fokker f fleet was impaired  and a write down of million was taken against the book value of those aircraft and related spare parts 

table of contents in  due to the sagging economy and its impact on the airline industry  the company evaluated whether the book value of its aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets this statement supercedes sfas no 

no impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluation 
there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future

financing activities during  alaska issued million of debt secured by flight equipment 
this debt was issued with varying interest rates based on libor and payment terms of years 
additionally  during  horizon added three dash and seven crj aircraft to its operating fleet 
the aircraft were financed with a combination of us leveraged leases and single investor leases with terms of ten to years 
the aggregate future minimum lease payments under these ten new operating leases will be million 
commitments at december   alaska and horizon had firm orders for aircraft requiring aggregate payments of approximately million 
in addition  alaska has options to acquire more bs  and horizon has options to acquire dash s and crj s 
alaska expects to finance its new aircraft with leases  long term debt  or internally generated cash 
horizon expects to finance its new aircraft with operating leases 
as previously mentioned  as a result of the events of september  credit rating agencies downgraded the long term credit ratings of most us airlines and their related entities 
the events of september combined with the sagging economy and its affect on the airline industry have had a negative impact on the availability of credit to the company 
we anticipate that it will be more difficult to obtain credit in the future  and it will be at higher rates with more collateral requirements than in the past

table of contents alaska is party to a purchase agreement with an aircraft manufacturer 
under the agreement  upon commitment to purchase the aircraft  alaska must make deposits to the manufacturer for a portion of the purchase price of the aircraft  with the remainder of the purchase price due at delivery 
concurrent with this agreement  the manufacturer has an agreement with a trust wherein the trust makes deposits to the manufacturer of additional pre delivery deposits for the aircraft 
under certain specified events  including default by the trust  alaska may be required to pay the manufacturer the amounts paid by the trust in order to retain the right to purchase the aircraft
