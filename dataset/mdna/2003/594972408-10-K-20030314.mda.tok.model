industry background business intelligence offers decision makers the opportunity to ask and answer mission critical questions about their business using data that has been captured but not exploited to its fullest extent 
four key trends have driven demand for business intelligence tools improved supply efficiency supplier transactions become more efficient with direct access to inventory and other related data 
for true vendor managed inventory and collaborative commerce systems  vendors need to have access to key information about how their products are performing against business metrics 
for example  vendors should be able to see how their products are selling in each geographic region so as not to over ship products that are slow moving or under ship products that are selling quickly 
by opening vendor performance information to the vendors themselves  buyers and sellers of goods and services become partners in the quest to optimize sales  margin and inventory 
improved distribution efficiency business partners collaborate more effectively with access to shared data 
by granting access to information such as the manufacturing pipeline and build schedule  partners can be more effective at satisfying end customers and setting expectations 
opening invoice and purchase order information to partners will enable them to reduce the overhead associated with channel management  resulting in cost savings and time efficiencies 
for example  notifying channel sales partners of changes in the manufacturing schedule allows them to reset end customer expectations or to increase selling activity 
need for increased user scalability businesses can derive increasing value from information about their products and services 
by providing information to more employees  businesses can differentiate their service offering or become more efficient by enabling more customer self service 
in a market crowded with mass market advertising  customers increasingly value meaningful interactions with companies 
customers want companies to know their interests and preferences 
customers also want to be able to login to their providers systems to check their billing and order status 
these are features that a business intelligence platform can deliver to help differentiate a company in a crowded marketplace 
increased data scalability the growth in data volumes and database sizes has allowed businesses to paint a more comprehensive picture of their operations 
the ability to offer various types of analyses and information to more employees  such as seasonality  product placement  market baskets  quality  returns  
table of contents fraud detection and analysis  is making businesses more profitable and efficient 
an integrated business intelligence platform can facilitate better decisions from this wealth of data 
the emergence and widespread acceptance of the internet or web as a medium of communication and commerce have changed the way businesses interact with each other and their customers by allowing businesses to establish new revenue streams  create new distribution channels and reduce costs 
simultaneously  the amount of corporate information stored in databases continues to grow exponentially  and companies are giving an increasing number of employees  customers and partners access to their information 
business intelligence tools are the gateway to this information 
for example  companies are using internet based systems to facilitate business operations  including sales automation  supply chain management  marketing  customer service and human resource management 
consumers are also becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of the internet  relying on the internet not only to make online purchases  but to perform price comparisons  analyze recommendations from like minded individuals  educate themselves about relevant products and offerings and enter into transactions that were once conducted face to face or via the telephone 
the integration of the internet into business processes and increased consumer sophistication create opportunities for companies to use business intelligence applications as part of a more dynamic business model 
factors driving demand for these applications include increased electronic capture of transaction  operational and customer information 
the rapid growth in the electronic capture of business information and the increased availability of related profile data on the parties or products involved in each transaction are providing businesses with a rich data foundation for performing various analyses and making decisions 
powerful data analysis and mining tools are required to sift through massive amounts of data to uncover information regarding customer interactions  trends  patterns and exceptions  in turn enabling organizations to provide superior service and products to customers 
need to create a personalized  one to one customer and or supplier experience while maintaining privacy 
many companies are initiating strategies that establish personalized relationships with each customer and or supplier based on individual needs and preferences  and earn their loyalty by providing superior service  security and convenience 
in order to successfully acquire  retain and upgrade customers  organizations need to understand their profiles  their transaction history  their past responses to marketing campaigns  and their interactions with customer service 
retrieving information from widely dispersed and complex data sources and providing a holistic view of the customer can be challenging 
at the same time  while businesses have the opportunity to collect a variety of information that could improve targeting  customers are increasingly concerned about the potential for loss or abuse of their privacy 
need to integrate online and traditional operations 
while there are substantial benefits to conducting business electronically  companies need to ensure that their online operations work in combination with their traditional operations 
companies are seeking to ensure that an order placed online can be reliably fulfilled according to the expectations of the customer and to develop and maintain consistent interactions with customers across different channels 
maintaining the integrity of  and enhancing  the customer experience are crucial to fostering customer loyalty and supply chain relationships 
emergence of web browsers as the standard interface for business intelligence applications 
until recently  business intelligence tools were primarily deployed only at the headquarter offices of a company 
with web based business intelligence applications  store clerks  customer service representatives and technicians can have the tools to make data driven decisions in the field via intranets 
the web facilitates an unprecedented degree of collaboration between geographically distributed people 
headquarters based users and distributed users now have access to the same data through the same tool 
hopes for the web have revolved around its ability to serve as a point of transaction for customers and trading partners 
with a web based business intelligence system  a business intelligence application can become the point of decision that provides users  customers and partners with the information they need to make insightful decisions 
increased openness of business intelligence applications to customers  suppliers and partners 
business intelligence systems are no longer confined to the corporation 
today  companies are extending their business intelligence insight to suppliers  channel partners and customers via extranets 
business partners can have up to the minute access to sales histories  inventory status and billing information through their web browsers 

table of contents emergence of wireless internet and voice technologies 
information can be more valuable if there is untethered  ubiquitous access to the information 
the development of the wireless application protocol and improvements in text to speech and voice recognition technologies have created a uniform technology platform for delivering internet based information and services to mobile devices 
an integrated platform reduces the need for relying on multiple vendors for these products and services 
this development is expected to generate new business opportunities for companies by providing an additional channel for existing services and creating opportunities to provide new services that can be delivered any place and at any time to anyone that has access to a wireless device

many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly

critical accounting policies microstrategy s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of our accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
microstrategy does not have any ownership interest in any special purpose entities that are not wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries of microstrategy 
additionally  microstrategy does not have any material related party transactions as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 related party disclosures 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to revenue recognition  restructuring and impairment charges and litigation and contingencies  have a material impact on our financial statements  and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations as discussed below 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs  intangible assets  income taxes  and financing operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 

table of contents actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included below under risk factors 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
microstrategy s software revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of software  we follow the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we also follow the guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements filed with the sec 
we recognize revenue from sales of software licenses to end users or resellers upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement  as provided by agreements or contracts executed by both parties  delivery of the software  and determination that collection of a fixed or determinable fee is reasonably assured 
when the fees for software upgrades and enhancements  maintenance  consulting and education are bundled with the license fee  they are unbundled using our objective evidence of the fair value of the elements represented by our customary pricing for each element in separate transactions 
if such evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established for delivered elements  revenue is first allocated to the elements where evidence of fair value has been established and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of an arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop when a software license arrangement requires us to provide significant production  customization or modification of the software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product license revenue and consulting services revenue are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under percentage of completion accounting  both product license and consulting services revenue are recognized as work progresses based upon labor hours incurred 
any expected losses on contracts in progress are expensed in the period in which the losses become probable and reasonably estimable 
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method were immaterial for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method represented approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
if an arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria  or the acceptance period lapses  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver specified future products or upgrades  the revenue is recognized when the specified future product or upgrades are delivered  or when the obligation to deliver specified future products expires  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  then revenue is recognized on the subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
license revenue derived from sales to resellers or original equipment manufacturers oem who purchase our products for future resale is recognized upon sufficient evidence that the products have been sold to the ultimate end users provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
maintenance revenue  included in product support and other services revenue  is derived from providing technical support and software updates and upgrades to customers 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which in most cases is one year 
revenue from consulting and education services is recognized as the services are performed 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are included in deferred revenue and advance payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents microstrategy s ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed below under risk factors 
restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring and impairment charges have been recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining the costs associated with real estate lease losses from exiting facilities  management was required to make judgments and estimates which significantly impacted the recorded amount of restructuring and impairment charges 
the real estate lease losses included estimates of sublease commission costs  sub tenant concession costs  sublease rental income and the expected length of time to sublease idle space 
final results could substantially differ from current estimates if we are unable to sublet the remaining vacant office space on the estimated terms 
litigation and contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are involved in lawsuits with business objects  sa relating to claims involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims 
as the actions relating to business objects are in a preliminary stage  we are currently unable to estimate the potential range of gain or loss  if any  and as such the outcome of this uncertainty is not presently determinable 
accordingly  no provision for these matters has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additional information regarding these matters is included below under risk factors 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of our accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration in the financial condition of our customers  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact of our revenues and operations 
software development costs 
we account for software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that software development costs incurred internally should be expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
once technological feasibility has been established  all software development costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
we consider technological feasibility to be achieved when a product design and working model of the software product have been completed 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  if we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
subsequent impairment assessments could result in future impairment charges 
any impairment charge would result in reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets and would reduce our operating results in the period in which the charge arose 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  statements of operations data revenues product licenses product support and other services total revenues cost of revenues product licenses product support and other services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring and impairment charges amortization of goodwill and intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations financing and other income expense interest income interest expense loss on investments reduction in provision for estimated cost of litigation settlement gain on contract termination gain on early extinguishment of notes payable other income expense  net total financing and other income expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations loss from abandonment loss from discontinued operations net income loss dividends  accretion and beneficial conversion feature on convertible preferred stock net gain on refinancing of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock net gain on refinancing of series b  c and d convertible preferred stock gain on early redemption of redeemable convertible preferred stock of discontinued operations series a preferred stock beneficial conversion feature net income loss attributable to common stockholders 
table of contents comparison of   and revenues 
total revenues consist of revenues derived from sales of product licenses and product support and other services  including technical support  education and consulting services 
total revenues decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in  representing a decrease of in  and a decrease of in product licenses revenues 
product licenses revenues decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in  representing a worldwide decrease of in  and a worldwide decrease of in  which included a decrease in in international revenues as discussed below 
although there continues to be a worldwide economic slowdown and decreased corporate spending on information technology generally  we believe that demand in the business intelligence market has remained relatively flat 
we believe that the decline in our product licenses revenues has been attributable to our decision to limit our sales focus to licensing core business intelligence software and generating profitable transactions  which at the same time has substantially reduced our sales and marketing related costs 
during  we introduced several new products that complement our business intelligence platform which we believe have been well accepted by our customers and industry analysts 
additionally  during the latter part of  we have taken measures to increase the size of our sales force 
we expect product licenses revenues as a percentage of total revenues to fluctuate on a period to period basis and vary significantly from the percentage of total revenues achieved in prior years 
product support and other services revenues 
product support and other services revenues decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in  representing a decrease of in  and a decrease of in the overall decrease in product support and other services revenues during was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for consulting and education services 
the overall decrease in product support and other services revenues during was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for consulting services and the termination of the agreement with exchange applications  discussed below  and was offset by a slight increase in revenues from technical support services 
as a result of possible fluctuations in product licenses revenues discussed above  product support and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate on a period to period basis and vary significantly from the percentage of total revenues achieved in prior years 
during  we notified exchange applications  inc that it was in material default in the performance of its obligations under the software development and oem agreement the oem agreement that had been entered into as of december  as a result of this dispute and because we were no longer performing services under the oem agreement  the remaining current and long term deferred revenue associated with the contract at that time of million and million  respectively  or million in aggregate  was classified as contingency from terminated contract in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  on june   we entered into an arrangement with exchange applications to terminate the oem agreement 
in connection with the arrangement  we paid  to exchange applications 
additionally  we granted exchange applications a limited license to support exchange applications customers that had purchased products prior to the effective date of the arrangement 
as a result  we recognized  of product support and other services revenues in through the date of termination and recorded the remaining million of contingency from terminated contract as a gain on contract termination during the second quarter of during  we recognized  of product licenses revenues and million of product support and other services revenues relating to this contract 
international revenues 
international revenues are included in the amounts discussed above and are discussed separately within this paragraph 
international revenues increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in  representing an increase of in  and a decrease of in international product license revenues decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in  representing decreases of in and in international product support and other services revenues increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in  representing an increase of in and a decrease of in during  we agreed to restructure our relationship with a significant international customer 
while we had been providing services to the customer throughout the year  in accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policies  no revenue had been recognized 
in view of changes in the customer s internal information technology 
table of contents plans  we entered into an agreement with the customer in which we agreed to discontinue our development efforts and deliver all existing work product 
since we had no future obligations to this customer other than technical support obligations  all payments were made prior to the end of the year  and all other revenue recognition criteria were met  we recorded revenues of million in  of which million and  were recognized as product license revenues and product support and other services revenues  respectively  and an additional million related to ongoing technical support obligations was recorded as deferred revenue 
the increase in international revenues in was due to the expansion of our international operations  new product offerings and growing international market acceptance of our software products 
in addition  we opened new sales offices in argentina  switzerland  mexico  korea and australia in  in brazil in  and in canada  italy  austria  france  the netherlands  germany  united kingdom and spain prior to the decrease in international revenues in is primarily attributable to the continued global economic slowdown  which led to decreased corporate spending on information technology 
we believe the global economic slowdown had a greater impact on our international product licenses revenues in as compared to our domestic product licenses revenues in additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we closed our switzerland and austria offices 
as a percentage of total revenues  international revenues were in  in  and in we anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant amount of total revenues  and management expects to continue to commit significant time and financial resources to the maintenance and ongoing development of direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
in the latter part of  there was extensive economic turmoil in argentina which subsequently resulted in a significant devaluation of the argentine peso 
revenues from our operations in argentina accounted for of total revenues in and of total revenues in costs and expenses cost of product licenses revenues 
cost of product licenses revenues consists primarily of the costs of product manuals  media  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and royalties paid to third party software vendors 
cost of product licenses revenues increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in as a percentage of product licenses revenues  cost of product license revenues increased from in to in  and decreased to in the increase in cost of product licenses revenues as a percentage of product licenses revenues in was primarily due to increased software royalty arrangements with third party software vendors resulting from an increase in microstrategy software sold that included third party software 
conversely  the decrease in cost of product licenses revenues as a percentage of product licenses revenues in was primarily due to decreased software royalty arrangements with third party software vendors 
in the event that we enter into additional software royalty arrangements with third party software vendors in the future  cost of product licenses revenues as a percentage of total product licenses revenues may increase 
the decrease in was partially offset by an increase in the amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with the release of microstrategy i and narrowcast server in april and web universal in november in connection with the release of these three products  we expect cost of product licenses revenues to increase by approximately  in as a result of the amortization of software development costs that were capitalized in cost of product support and other services 
cost of product support and other services consists of the costs of providing consulting services to customers and partners  technical advisory services  technical support and education 
cost of product support and other services revenues decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in as a percentage of product support and other services revenues  cost of product support and other services revenues was in  in and in the decrease in total cost of product support and other services revenues as a percentage of product support and other services revenues services cost was primarily due to sequential decreases in our consulting  technical support and education staffing levels 
in connection with the implementation of our restructuring plans in the second and third quarters of  our staffing levels decreased by approximately in as compared to  and by in as compared to additionally  the significant sequential decreases in services cost was also attributable to improved utilization of consulting personnel as a consequence of the overall restructuring plans  a decrease in the use of third parties to perform consulting services  and an increase in technical support revenues as a percentage of total product support and other services revenues  which result in higher profit margins than other product support revenues  such as consulting and educational services 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  advertising  public relations programs and promotional events  such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were in  in and in during the first quarter of  we invested heavily in advertising  including a national television and print advertising campaign and other marketing efforts in order to create better market awareness of the value added potential of our product suite and to seek to acquire market share 
these advertising programs were not continued in the latter half of or thereafter 
the sequential decreases in sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to decreased staffing levels in the sales force as a result of our restructuring plans  decreased commissions expense as a result of lower product license revenues and decreased promotional activities and advertising 
staffing levels for sales and marketing personnel were lower by approximately in as compared to in as compared to  staffing levels of our sales and marketing personnel decreased by an additional  although by the end of  we had taken measures to increase the size of our sales force 
as part of the restructuring plans adopted in the second and third quarters of  we have reduced overall spending on marketing initiatives and advertising and have focused our marketing efforts solely on our core business intelligence product line 
sales and marketing expenses may increase in if we continue to expand our sales force 
research and development expenses

com  and to on going support of existing products and other research and development efforts 
the allocation of our research and development resources is expected to change as project development efforts require  as current projects are completed  and as new projects commence 
for the year ended december   in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer equipment to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  we capitalized million of software development costs associated with the development of our new business intelligence products 
for the year ended december   we capitalized million of software development costs associated with the development of microstrategy i and the release of narrowcast server software development costs of a product are capitalized from the time that technological feasibility is reached until the general release of that product 
we consider technological feasibility to be achieved when a product design and working model of the software product has been completed 
these capitalized software costs are amortized over their respective useful lives of approximately three years 
amortization expense related to software development costs was million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and we expect amortization expense related to software development costs to increase to million in the year ending december

costs associated with exiting facilities included estimated sublease losses  representing the excess of lease costs over sublease income  estimated sublease commissions and concessions  and other facility closing costs including rent expense while the office space is vacant 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the adequacy of our restructuring reserve based upon changes in current market conditions 
due to a decline in estimated sublease rates and an increase in the expected length of time to sublease vacant space  we updated our accrued restructuring costs by recording additional sublease losses of million during in connection with a periodic assessment of the carrying value of long lived assets  we concluded that the products derived from our teracube intangible asset  which had been acquired in connection with the purchase of intellectual property and other tangible and intangible assets relating to ncr corporation s teracube project  would not generate sufficient cash flow to support its carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of to write down that intangible asset to its fair value

as of december   we had million accrued for our estimated computer  equipment and real estate lease losses  representing million in gross lease obligations and million of estimated commissions  concessions  and other costs  offset by million in estimated gross sublease income recoveries during the remaining lease terms 
if we are unable to obtain this level of estimated sublease income  we will incur additional restructuring costs and our cash position would be adversely affected 
we are also considering terminating certain leases early 
we estimated sublease losses based upon current information available relating to sublease commission costs  sub tenant concession costs  sublease rental income  and the length of time expected to sublease our idle space 
final actual amounts could differ from current estimates if we are unable to sublet the remaining vacant space on the estimated terms

since he is a principal shareholder  his actions were deemed to be an action undertaken on behalf of the company for accounting purposes

substantially all cash payments related to this restructuring plan were made prior to december  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets decreased from million in  to million in  and to million in the decrease in amortization expense is attributable to the impairment charge of million recorded in to write down the carrying value of our teracube intangible asset to its fair value

 goodwill and other intangible assets  described under recent accounting pronouncements below

the reduction in provision for estimated cost of litigation settlement was comprised of the following in thousands promissory notes class a common stock warrants pending loss on additional settlement legal fees administration costs total less insurance recoveries reduction in provision for estimated cost of litigation settlement the change in the value of the promissory notes was primarily due to an increase in the assumed fair market discount rate on the notes resulting from changes in both market conditions and the company s creditworthiness between the date that the settlement agreements were originally entered into in october and the date upon which the securities were issued in june and july the change in the value of the class a common stock and the warrants was primarily attributable to significant declines in the market value of our class a common stock between the settlement date and the date of issuance 
we are involved in lawsuits with business objects  sa relating to claims involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims 
as the actions relating to business objects are in a preliminary stage  we are currently unable to estimate the potential range of gain or loss  if any  and as such the outcome of this uncertainty is not presently determinable 
accordingly  no provision for these matters has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf no 
 an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in sfas no 
 the fasb acknowledges that an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to the other parties that meets the definition of a liability and requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future we generated net income for the year ended december   however  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain we may require additional external financing through credit facilities  sale of additional debt or equity securities in microstrategy or by obtaining other financing facilities to support our operations 
obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance  and investor sentiment 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive to us 
if we are unable to raise capital needed to fund our operations and repay our outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock for a number of reasons  including those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of the size  timing and execution of significant orders and shipments  the mix of products and services of customer orders  which can affect whether we recognize revenue upon the signing and delivery of our software products or whether revenue must be recognized as work progresses or over the entire contract period  the timing of new product announcements  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of business intelligence software generally and of new and enhanced versions of our products in particular  
table of contents the length of our sales cycles  changes in our operating expenses  personnel changes  our success in adding to our indirect distribution channels  utilization of our consulting personnel  which can be affected by delays or deferrals of customer implementation of our software products and consulting  education and support services  changes in the value of the warrants to purchase  shares of class a common stock  increases in which will have the effect of reducing our reported operating results and decreases in which will have the effect of increasing our quarterly operating results  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and seasonal factors  such as our traditionally lower pace of new sales in the summer 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
many of our expenses  such as office and equipment leases and personnel costs  are relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter 
based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall 
we may lose sales  or sales may be delayed  due to the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  which would reduce our revenues to date  our customers have typically invested substantial time  money and other resources and involved many people in the decision to license our software products and purchase our consulting and other services 
as a result  we may wait nine months or more after the first contact with a customer for that customer to place an order while they seek internal approval for the purchase of our products and or services 
during this long sales cycle  events may occur that affect the size or timing of the order or even cause it to be canceled 
for example  our competitors may introduce new products  or the customer s own budget and purchasing priorities may change 
even after an order is placed  the time it takes to deploy our products and complete consulting engagements varies widely from one customer to the next 
implementing our product can sometimes last several months  depending on the customer s needs and may begin only with a pilot program 
it may be difficult to deploy our products if the customer has complicated deployment requirements  which typically involve integrating databases  hardware and software from different vendors 
if a customer hires a third party to deploy our products  we cannot be sure that our products will be deployed successfully 
our recognition of deferred revenue and advance payments is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for succeeding periods our deferred revenue and advance payments were million as of december  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue and advance payments at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 

table of contents the issuance of class a common stock upon a conversion of our series a unsecured notes could result in a substantial number of additional shares of class a common stock being issued we have outstanding million principal amount of our series a unsecured notes as part of a class action litigation settlement 
we have the option at any time prior to the june  maturity date of the notes  subject to certain limitations  to convert the notes into a number of shares of class a common stock equal to the principal amount of the notes being converted divided by of the dollar volume weighted average trading price of the class a common stock over a ten day period preceding our delivery of a notice of conversion  which could result in a substantial number of shares of class a common stock being issued 
for example  if the conversion price of the notes were based on the dollar volume weighted average trading price of the class a common stock during the trading days ending march   we would be obligated to issue  shares of class a common stock if we elected to convert the remaining notes 
in addition  if we elect to convert the notes at prices that would result in the issuance of shares with a market value in excess of the value of the notes reflected on our balance sheet  we would incur a non cash charge to earnings at the time of conversion equal to the amount of such excess  and this charge could be substantial 
the issuance of a substantial number of shares of class a common stock upon future conversions of the notes may result in substantial dilution to the interests of holders of class a common stock and may result in downward pressure on the price of our class a common stock 
we have substantial real estate lease commitments for unoccupied space and if we are unable to sublet this space on acceptable terms our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected we are party to real estate leases for approximately  square feet that are unoccupied 
we have established a restructuring reserve of million related to the costs of disposition of this space as of december  in establishing this reserve  we have assumed that we will be able to sublet the available space and receive approximately million of sublease income relating to this space 
we may not be able to sublet this space on the assumed terms 
if we are unable to do so  we would incur additional restructuring costs relating to these leases and would expend more cash than currently expected  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we face intense competition  which may lead to lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins  loss of market share and reduced revenue the markets for business intelligence software  analytical applications and narrowcast messaging technologies are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 
microstrategy s most direct competitors include providers of business intelligence software  olap tools  query and reporting tools  web based static reporting tools  and report delivery and proactive alerting 
each of these markets is discussed more fully below 
business intelligence software 
makers of business intelligence software provide business intelligence capabilities designed for integration  customization and application development 
companies such as microsoft  oracle  hyperion solutions  sap ag  computer associates and sas provide business intelligence software 

table of contents olap tools 
companies that build software to perform online analytical processing olap provide offerings competitive with the core microstrategy i platform 
whether web based or client server  these tools give end users the ability to query underlying data sources without having to hand code structured query language queries 
most olap tools allow users to build their own calculations and specify report layouts and other options 
additionally  olap tools provide users the ability to navigate throughout the underlying data in an easy  graphical mode  often referred to as drilling 
providers of olap tools include cognos  hyperion solutions  brio software  ibm  crystal decisions and microsoft 
query and reporting tools 
query and reporting tools allow large numbers of end users to gain access to pre defined reports for simple analysis 
often the end users are able to specify some sort of run time criteria that customizes the result set for that particular person 
some limited drilling is also provided 
companies that produce query and reporting tools include business objects  cognos  oracle  crystal decisions  information builders and brio software 
web based static reporting tools 
companies that offer software to deliver pre built reports for end user viewing and consumption can also compete with microstrategy 
these applications often lack the sophistication  robustness and scalability of microstrategy s platform  but can be attractive for small  departmental applications 
vendors in this category include actuate  business objects  crystal decisions  microsoft and sas 
report delivery and proactive alerting 
companies that focus on the proactive delivery of information  via e mail  website  or other medium can compete with microstrategy s offerings 
typically  these tools serve to push out compiled reports on a scheduled basis to sets of users based on job type 
microstrategy software has integrated this technology into the microstrategy i platform 
vendors of such technology include actuate and business objects 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain maintenance revenues from our installed customer base 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly michael j 
saylor  our chairman and chief executive officer  and sanju k 
bansal  our vice chairman  executive vice president and chief operating officer 
if we lose the services of one or both of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  assimilate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our inability to develop and release product enhancements and new products to respond to rapid technological change in a timely and cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
table of contents the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends largely on three factors our ability to continue to support a number of popular operating systems and databases  our ability to maintain and improve our current product line  and our ability to rapidly develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
business intelligence applications are inherently complex  and it can take a long time to develop and test major new products and product enhancements 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions because they anticipate that new or enhanced versions of our products will soon become available 
we cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or new customer requirements  nor can we be sure that any new products and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our ability to market our existing products the emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
this could happen  for example  if new web standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our products 
although the core database component of our business intelligence solutions is compatible with nearly all enterprise server hardware and operating system combinations  such as os  as  unix  linux and windows  certain of our application server components run only on the windows nt and windows operating systems 
therefore  our ability to increase sales currently depends in part on the continued acceptance of the windows nt and windows operating systems 
if the market for business intelligence software fails to grow as we expect  or if businesses fail to adopt our products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected nearly all of our revenues to date have come from sales of business intelligence software and related technical support  consulting and education services 
we expect these sales to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
although demand for business intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market for business intelligence software applications is still emerging 
resistance from consumer and privacy groups to increased commercial collection and use of data on spending patterns and other personal behavior and recent european union restrictions on the collection and use of personal data may impair the further growth of this market  as may other developments 
we cannot be sure that this market will continue to grow or  even if it does grow  that businesses will adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to keep spending  considerable resources to educate potential customers about business intelligence software in general and our solutions in particular 
however  we cannot be sure that these expenditures will help our products achieve any additional market acceptance 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
because of the rights of our two classes of common stock  and because we are controlled by our existing holders of class b common stock  these stockholders could transfer control of microstrategy to a third party without anyone else s approval or prevent a third party from acquiring microstrategy we have two classes of common stock class a common stock and class b common stock 
holders of our class a common stock generally have the same rights as holders of our class b common stock  except that holders of class a common stock have one vote per share while holders of class b common stock have ten votes per share 
as of march   holders of our class b common stock owned or controlled  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power 
michael j 
saylor  our chairman and chief executive officer  controlled  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting 
table of contents power  as of march  accordingly  mr 
saylor is able to control microstrategy through his ability to determine the outcome of elections of our directors  amend our certificate of incorporation and by laws and take other actions requiring the vote or consent of stockholders  including mergers  going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions and their terms 
our certificate of incorporation allows holders of class b common stock  almost all of whom are current employees or former employees of our company or related parties  to transfer shares of class b common stock  subject to the approval of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock could  without seeking anyone else s approval  transfer voting control of microstrategy to a third party 
such a transfer of control could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
mr 
saylor will also be able to prevent a change of control of microstrategy  regardless of whether holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
we rely on our strategic channel partners and if we are unable to develop or maintain successful relationships with them  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on strategic channel partners  such as value added resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers to license and support our products in the united states and internationally 
in particular  for the years ended december   and  channel partners accounted for  directly or indirectly  approximately  and of our total product licenses revenues  respectively 
our channel partners generally offer customers the products of several different companies  including some products that compete with ours 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product license revenues  we are seeking to increase the level of indirect sales activities through our strategic channel partners  however  we may not be successful in our efforts to expand indirect sales in this manner 
we may not be able to attract strategic partners who will market our products effectively and who will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in developing and maintaining successful relationships with those strategic partners 
if we are unable to develop or maintain our relationships with these strategic partners  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our software  which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing such unauthorized use is difficult  and we cannot be certain that we can prevent it  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our products may be susceptible to claims by other companies that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition as the number of software products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  any such claims could be time consuming and expensive to defend  may divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays and could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on october   business objects filed suit against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california  claiming that our software infringes a patent issued to business objects relating to relational database access 
the suit seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages 
we have filed an answer denying the allegations in the complaint and have filed a declaratory judgment counterclaim seeking to have business objects patent declared invalid and unenforceable against us 
a trial date has not yet been set in the northern district of california action 
we intend to vigorously defend the case 
on october   we filed suit against business objects  sa and its subsidiary  business objects americas  inc  in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia  claiming that business objects software infringes two patents held by us relating to asynchronous control of report generation using a web browser and a system and method of adapting automatic output of olap reports to disparate user output devices 
the complaint against business objects was amended to add claims for violations of the federal computer fraud and abuse act  misappropriation of trade secrets  tortious interference with contractual relations  and violations of the virginia conspiracy act 
as a result of pre trial rulings  certain of these claims were dismissed 
our claims for tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets are expected to proceed to trial  which is scheduled to commence on may  we are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
the patent claims have been stayed pending the conclusion of reexamination proceedings before the united states patent trademark office 

table of contents managing our international operations is complex and our failure to do so successfully or in a cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition international sales accounted  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  tax issues  including restrictions on repatriating earnings  weaker intellectual property protection in other countries  economic weakness or currency related crises that may arise in different countries or geographic regions  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the nature of our products makes them particularly vulnerable to undetected errors  or bugs  which could cause problems with how the products perform and which could in turn reduce demand for our products  reduce our revenue and lead to product liability claims against us software products as complex as ours may contain errors or defects 
although we test our products extensively  we have in the past discovered software errors in new products after their introduction 
despite testing by us and by our 
table of contents current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products or releases after commercial shipments begin 
this could result in lost revenue or delays in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain domestic or international jurisdictions 
although there have been no product liability claims against us to date  our license and support of products may involve the risk of these claims 
a successful product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the price of our stock may be extremely volatile the market price for our class a common stock has historically been volatile and could fluctuate significantly for any of the following reasons quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  technological innovations or new products  governmental regulatory action  general conditions in the software industry  increased price competition  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by analysts  any change in the actual or expected amount of dilution attributable to issuances of additional shares of class a common stock as a result of conversions of our series a unsecured notes  or other events or factors 
many of the above factors are beyond our control 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market price of many software companies  often without regard to their operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash in short term  fixed income financial instruments 
these fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate risk and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels at december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income 
table of contents investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a percentage of total revenues  international revenues grew from in to in  and increased to in we anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant amount of total revenues 
to date  we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign exchange exposure 
although we may do so in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques we may implement will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
in the latter part of and throughout  there has been extensive economic turmoil in argentina  which has resulted in a significant devaluation of the argentine peso 
revenues from our operations in argentina accounted for of total revenues in and of total revenues in management believes that our economic exposure in the region is not significant
