inflation the company s results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation 
subject to normal competitive conditions  the company generally has been able to pass along rising costs through increased advertising and circulation rates 
significant accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  remaining useful lives of long lived assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  as well as contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and bad debt accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to the company from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company uses historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  were amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives for the years presented in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if required  for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company adopted sfas at the beginning of fiscal year see further discussions  under new accounting pronouncements herein  of sfas and sfas issued in june and sfas issued in october pension and post retirement benefits pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future as a result of fluctuations in the company s headcount and changes in actuarial assumptions 
litigation the company is involved in a number of litigation matters that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes that the outcome of these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue is earned from the sale of advertising  circulation and commercial printing 
advertising revenues are recognized  net of agency commissions in the period when advertising is printed or placed on the company s web sites 
circulation revenues are recognized when purchased newspapers are distributed 
amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations and clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if required  for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  the company adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal year if the provisions of sfas no 
were applied to the company s fiscal year results  the company s amortization expense would have been reduced by approximately million and  correspondingly  the company s earnings per diluted share would have increased by per diluted share 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this statement did not have a current impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
certain factors which may affect the company s future performance newspaper industry competition the company s business is concentrated in newspapers and other publications located primarily in small metropolitan and suburban areas in the united states 
revenues in the newspaper industry primarily consist of advertising and paid circulation 
competition for advertising and paid circulation comes from local  regional and national newspapers  shopping guides  television  radio  direct mail  online services and other forms of communication and advertising media 
competition for advertising revenues is based largely upon advertiser results  readership  advertising rates  demographics and circulation levels  while competition for circulation and readership is based largely upon the content of the newspaper  its price and the effectiveness of its distribution 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
dependence on local economies the company s advertising revenues and  to a lesser extent  circulation revenues are dependent on a variety of factors specific to the communities which the company s newspapers serve 
these factors include  among others  the size and demographic characteristics of the local population  local economic conditions in general  and the related retail segments in particular  and local weather conditions 
capitalization as of december   the consolidated indebtedness of the company was million  which represents a multiple of times the company s twelve months trailing ebitda of approximately million 
as of december   the company had a net stockholders deficit of million and total capitalization of million and  thus  the percentage of the company s indebtedness to total capitalization was percent 
the company may incur additional indebtedness to fund operations  capital expenditures  future acquisitions or share repurchases 
the company s management believes that cash provided by operating activities  future borrowings and its ability to issue common stock will be sufficient to fund its operations and to meet payment requirements under its term loans and the revolving credit facility of the credit agreement 
however  a decline in cash provided by operating activities  which could result from factors beyond the company s control  such as unfavorable economic conditions  an overall decline in advertising revenues or increased competition  could impair the company s ability to service its debt 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on the company  which may restrict  among other things  the company s ability to declare dividends  repurchase company stock  incur indebtedness  create liens  sell assets  consummate mergers and make capital expenditures  investments and acquisitions 
acquisition strategy the company has grown through  and anticipates that it will continue to grow through  acquisitions of daily and non daily newspapers and similar publications 
acquisitions may expose the company to risks  including  without limitation  diversion of management s attention  assumption of unidentified liabilities and assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
depending on the value and nature of the consideration paid by the company for acquisitions  such acquisitions may have a dilutive impact on the company s earnings per share 
in making acquisitions  the company competes for acquisition targets with other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities  assessing the value  strengths and weaknesses of such opportunities  evaluating the costs of new growth opportunities at existing operations or managing the publications it owns and improving their operating efficiency 
historically  the company has financed acquisitions through available cash  free cash flow  borrowings and sales of non strategic properties 
the company anticipates that it will finance future acquisitions through these same resources 
the credit agreement limits acquisitions to certain permitted investments and newspapers in the united states  and requires that acquisitions be financed through certain permitted sources 
in addition  the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement may limit the company s ability to make acquisitions 
price and availability of newsprint the basic raw material for newspapers is newsprint 
in fiscal year  the company consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint  excluding paper consumed in its commercial printing operations 
the average price per metric ton of newsprint based on east coast transactions prices in  and was  and  respectively  as reported by the trade publication  pulp and paper weekly 
the company purchases the majority of its newsprint through its central purchasing group  journal register supply 
the company has no long term contracts to purchase newsprint 
generally  journal register supply purchases most of its newsprint from one or two suppliers  although in the future the company may purchase newsprint from other suppliers 
historically  the percentage of newsprint from each supplier has varied 
the company s management believes that concentrating its newsprint purchases in this way provides a more secure newsprint supply and lower unit prices 
the company s management also believes that it purchases newsprint at price levels lower than those that are generally available to individually owned small metropolitan and suburban newspapers  and consistent with price levels generally available to the largest newsprint purchasers 
the available sources of newsprint have been  and the company believes will continue to be  adequate to supply the company s needs 
the inability of the company to obtain an adequate supply of newsprint in the future could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
historically  the price of newsprint has been cyclical and volatile 
the company s average price per ton of newsprint decreased approximately percent for fiscal year  increased approximately nine percent for fiscal year and increased approximately six percent for fiscal year  each as compared to the preceding year 
the company believes that if any price decrease or increase is sustained in the industry  the company will also be impacted by such change 
the company seeks to manage the effects of increases in prices of newsprint through a combination of  among other things  technology improvements  including web width reductions  inventory management and advertising and circulation price increases 
the company also has reduced fringe circulation in response to increased newsprint prices  as it is the company s experience that such circulation does not provide adequate response for advertisers 
in fiscal year  the company s newsprint cost excluding paper consumed in the company s commercial printing operations was approximately percent of the company s newspaper revenues 
environmental matters the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to air and water quality  storage tanks and the management and disposal of waste at its facilities 
to the best of the company s knowledge  its operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations as currently interpreted 
the company cannot predict with any certainty whether future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the discovery of conditions not currently known to the company  may give rise to additional costs that could be material 
furthermore  actions by federal  state and local governments concerning environmental matters could result in laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company
