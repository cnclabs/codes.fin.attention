the bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries msb properties and mid coast land company discussed above in part i of this report and later in this management s discussion and analysis 
the bank was founded in and operates a full service commercial banking business serving its customers on the central coast of california 
headquartered in arroyo grande  it operates offices in communities throughout san luis obispo  santa barbara and ventura counties and serves over  households and businesses 
the following discussion and analysis will provide insight and supplementary information into the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company

results and accomplishments financial the company  on a consolidated basis  reported net income of million in and million in after generating million in the diluted earnings per share eps was for compared to in and in consolidated total assets at december  were billion compared to billion at december   up 
total deposits also increased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  shareholders common equity stood at million at year end up from its million level one year earlier 
factors contributing to the increase in shareholders common equity included  the million of net income generated for the year  a million after tax change in the unrealized gain on available for sale securities  and the million received for the exercise of stock options 
partially offsetting these increases were million in dividends paid out and million paid for the repurchase of common stock outstanding

broadly speaking  in terms of customer contact areas  the company approaches its customer base from three perspectives retail banking  business banking and corporate banking 
corporate banking will handle the needs of larger companies with annual revenue in excess of five million dollars  large private banking clients  agricultural banking and real estate developers 
business banking will focus on the needs of smaller businesses with annual sales in the one to five million dollar range which typically have borrowing needs under one million dollars 
retail banking focuses more on the needs of the individual consumer and small main street business through such products as traditional checking and savings accounts  installment loans  mortgage loans  merchant services and cash reserve 
both business and retail banking are broken into three regions 
the north mid san luis obispo county region includes the communities of san luis obispo  coastal areas from los osos north  and cities in northern san luis obispo county 
the five cities santa maria valley region includes the five cities area  nipomo  the santa maria valley and lompoc 
the santa barbara ventura county region includes the santa ynez valley  santa barbara goleta and the communities in ventura county 
corporate banking is managed by a mid coast and southern sectional manager 
offices however are maintained in key communities with local corporate bankers in paso robles  san luis obispo  the five cities  santa maria corporate and agricultural  santa barbara  ventura and oxnard 
with the early retirement of the company s former chief credit officer  mid state undertook an extensive search for a new chief credit officer in early involving both external and internal candidates 
on march  the company announced the appointment of mr 
harry sackrider to the position of chief credit officer  overseeing all credit policy and analysis  risk management  credit administration  and loan review for the bank 
mr 
sackrider has over years in banking with extensive real estate experience 
mr 
sackrider joined the bank in and most recently held the position of senior vice president and real estate credit administrator since in january  mr 
sackrider was given the additional corporate title of executive vice president and chief credit officer 
the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to five percent of its outstanding shares in march of  and upon completing that initial program  authorized the repurchase of an additional five percent of its outstanding shares in may the buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares resulting in an improvement to the company s earnings per share and to its return on equity 
these repurchases are being made from time to time by the company in the open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the securities and exchange commission sec rules 
the total number of shares repurchased was   and  in  and  respectively 
as of december   the company could repurchase up to an additional  shares under the may authorization 
there were two changes of note on the company s board of directors during the year 
mr 
raymond jones  who had served on the board since and prior to that had worked for the bank since in the capacity of cashier and later chief financial officer  retired from the board in may he will continue to serve the board as a director emeritus 
on a sadder note  aj diani  who had served on the board since the company s merger with bank of santa maria as vice chairman of the board  passed away on october  his exemplary record of service to the community is held in the highest regard by members of the company 
he will be greatly missed 
other milestones for the bank in  while less significant than those noted above  are certainly notable 
approvals were finally obtained and work commenced on a permanent structure to replace the bank s office in cambria 
the final property held by mid coast land company was sold with closing occurring in january and the mid state bank foundation  started in  contributed over thousand throughout the tri county area 
coupled with donations made directly by the bank  mid state contributed over thousand in support of charitable causes throughout its trade area 
external factors impacting the bank economic conditions at the start of  management noted in last year s annual report that we expected to witness a positive and improving level of economic activity over the course of the year 
in spite of the potential lingering effects of the war on terrorism  we expected this improving economic activity to extend beyond mid state s trade area and that the federal reserve would likely need to raise interest rates in the middle part of the year with prime raising to somewhere in the range by the end of as the company enters  we note that our outlook for was optimistic and was only reasonably accurate with respect to the local economy of the tri county service area of the bank 
the most comprehensive review of local economic conditions known to management comes from the university of california at santa barbara ucsb economic forecast project 
according to ucsb  gross county product in the tri county area was estimated at billion in  up from the level in the prior year 
adjusted for real dollars  it was up following a growth rate in while these rates of growth were down from the double digit increases witnessed in the late s  they were nonetheless substantially better than those exhibited by the state as a whole 
california s real state product was flat in and is estimated to actually have declined in by 
on a national level  real gross domestic product was better than the state  but not quite as healthy as the local tri county area  having increased in following a increase in the prior year 
growth in was centered earlier in the year as it slowed to an annualized rate of just in the fourth quarter 
the federal reserve board  which had lowered interest rates frequently and dramatically during  followed a steady course through most of  hoping that the lower interest rate levels would work to stimulate activity during the year 
but as the year progressed  with unemployment hovering near  with gross domestic product slowing  with the s p off some for the first months of the year and with continuing geo political risk creating a large degree of uncertainty throughout the country  the federal reserve board took the unusual step of lowering rates again by in november commercial banks quickly followed suit lowering the prime rate to 
early data suggest that  except in the housing industry  the additional rate cuts are having little effect on stimulating economic activity 
management believes that it is possible that the low rate environment is actually having the opposite of the desired effect 
low interest rate levels  while helping refinancing homeowners realize lower monthly payments  are negatively impacting the disposable incomes of those who are dependent on earnings from their savings 
commercial borrowing is not benefiting as was hoped because lenders can not make sufficient returns in the low rate environment to justify the risk inherent in certain loans 
moreover  potential commercial borrowers would appear to be more concerned about economic activity in general than the absolute level of rates currently 
current economic difficulties being experienced by the state are expected to have a negative effect on the local tri county area 
as the state moves to narrow its to billion deficit  the impacts on local cities  counties and schools are inescapable 
the public sector  which accounts for of employment in the tri counties  will see employment decline as funding from the state declines 
non employment related spending will also decrease in the face of tighter budgets 
the state is also expected to impose higher vehicle license fees  higher dmv use fees  higher state park fees  higher taxes for farmers on the use of pesticides  public safety surcharges on intrastate telephone calls  increased tuition costs at community colleges and state universities  and more 
national indicators do not yet show any significant improvement in the outlook for economic activity  though potentially positive impacts are on the horizon 
policymakers in washington would appear to be considering a number of potential stimulants for the economy which would be of help later this year 
it is generally agreed that a quick resolution of the war in iraq will also have a positive effect on the economy if for no other reason than through improved psychological sentiment 
a return of lower oil prices and stability of oil supplies would also have a positive impact 
local economic conditions  in spite of the problems at the state and national levels  are clearly better than in other parts of the state 
real gross county product  as noted above  continues at a positive pace and is expected by ucsb to improve in by across the tri county area 
unemployment rates are still low relative to the state and the nation at in san luis obispo county  in santa barbara county and in ventura county 
the local real estate market continues strong with demand far outpacing supply and median home prices at record highs 
lenders are more prudent in their lending practices having learned the lessons of the early s and building is far less speculative 
management is very cautious in its outlook for while local conditions would appear to be relatively favorable in the near term  the effects of national and state conditions are likely to be negative 
management does not see a return of robust economic conditions until at least and that will be highly dependent on the outcome of events in the middle east 
interest rates are not expected to rise until at least late and more than likely it is even possible that the federal reserve may  with no other effective tools available to it  lower rates again in their efforts to stimulate the economy 
competitive factors competitive pressures from other financial institutions continue to be intense both in the company s trade area and throughout the nation 
many banks are suffering from insufficient loan volumes and have become very aggressive on the pricing of those good credits available 
various mortgage bankers are blanketing the central coast communities with sales promotions and are extremely competitive with their rate programs 
it should also be noted that the trend toward consolidation of banking assets exhibited over the past few years in california continued in statewide  banks were merged out of existence or liquidated during the year and new banks commenced operation 
analysis of statement of financial position loans the bank experienced a decrease in net loans from  million at the end of  to  million at the end of this represents a decrease in the loan portfolio of million following the million increase in  which was primarily attributed to the merger with americorp 
the loan portfolio represents approximately of the bank s assets 
additionally  loans held for sale which are single family residential mortgages pending sale total million at the end of  up from million one year earlier 
mid sate bancshares trends in loan categories graphic the graph above displays the trend over the past five years in the various components of the loan portfolio 
construction loans have risen from their level five years earlier million at december  compared to million at year end real estate loans nearly doubled from million at the end of to million at the end of home equity credit lines have generally increased from million at the end of compared to million at the end of consumer loans installment and credit reserve have decreased from million at december  to million at year end which is due to the sale in december of credit card receivables 
commercial loans  while growing in recent years  declined to million at december  agricultural production loans decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of the bank expects to continue to emphasize all types of lending activity in order to diversify the risk in its portfolio 
economic activity in the central coast will determine the types of credit the bank will be able to extend and hence its ability to achieve this objective 
the bank s allowance for losses stands at million  or of gross loans  and represents losses not yet realized  but inherent in the loan portfolio and on unfunded commitments 
this amount is down from the million at december  the year end balance now represents of non performing loans which is down from at the end of a five year review of activity in the allowance for losses and an allocation by loan type of the allowance is shown in the tables below

the reduction of the unallocated portion in to million reflects additional specific allocations  especially on the company s construction land development and real estate loan portfolios 
non accrual loans within the bank s portfolio increased from million as of december   to million  at the end of loans days or more past due decreased from thousand at december   to zero at the end of additional information on non accrual loans  past due loans and troubled debt restructurings can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
the level of non accrual loans at the end of is centered primarily in two real estate secured loans total million 
management has established specific reserves that would offset potential losses  if any  arising from less than full recovery of the loans from the supporting collateral 
recoveries in of loans previously charged off totaled thousand compared to charge offs of million taken during the year resulting in net charge offs of million 
this compares to net charge offs incurred during of million and net charge offs of thousand in the bank anticipates that charge offs actual losses will continue during it is unlikely that recoveries would exceed charge offs in the coming year 
with the combination of the collateral securing the problem loans and the size of the allowance for losses  management feels that the allowance is sufficient to cover inherent losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance and also employs an independent third party loan review group to  among other things  review the adequacy of the allowance and make recommendations 
management  as necessary  adjusts the allowance on a regular basis 
the allowance is also examined annually by one or more of the bank s regulatory bodies including the fdic and dfi 
during the rd quarter of  the effects of an economic slow down prompted management to re evaluate the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  management recommended and the board of directors authorized an additional million provision for loans losses at that time 
no additional provision for loan losses was made after june of in view of the adequacy of the allowance 
the need for additional provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
the allowance for losses as a percentage of total loans stands at at the end of the adequacy of the allowance is determined by considering the type and quality of loans in the loan portfolio  trends in non accrual loans  trends in delinquencies  trends in actual losses  geographical distribution of loans  management expertise  economic outlook  diversification of the loan portfolio  value of available collateral  and the costs of collateral liquidation 
in establishing the allowance at december   management considered the quality of the loan portfolio obtained by acquisition and the slow down in economic activity and continues to acknowledge the combined high concentration of real estate loans  increases in certain higher risk activities such as construction lending  and higher levels of individually large corporate loans 
the allowance for losses consists of a statistically allocated portion and a specifically allocated portion 
the total of these components is considered adequate to provide for losses  which can be reasonably anticipated 
however  since these amounts are based on estimates  ultimate losses relating to these loans may vary 
a summary of maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates at december  and is shown in the table below

see footnote no 
to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed composition of the investment portfolio 
the treasury and agency portion of the portfolio increased by million from one year ago 
the bank increased its holdings in the municipal bond portfolio from million at the end of  to million at the end of the us treasury portion of the portfolio decreased by million while the federal agencies increased by million from december  to december  mortgage back securities increased million 
in total  the bank increased its investment portfolio from million at the end of to million at the end of  a million increase 
the bank may segregate its portfolio into three categories a trading portfolio which is carried at market value  with changes in market value reflected in the income statement  a held to maturity portfolio which is carried at amortized cost  with changes in market value having no impact on the financial statements and an available for sale portfolio which is carried at market value  with changes in market value reflected in comprehensive income 
the bank holds no securities that should be classified as trading securities 
the bank has determined that since its securities may be sold prior to maturity because of interest rate changes  to meet liquidity needs  or to better match the re pricing characteristics of funding sources  that the entire portfolio should be classified as available for sale 
on january   million in the held to maturity portfolio which the bank inherited from a prior meger was transferred to the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio 
ordinarily such transfers are prohibited  however  concurrent with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  a one time reclassification was permitted 
adjustments to the available for sale portfolio for changes in market values resulted in an unrealized gain of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  compared to an unrealized gain of million at december   net of related taxes 
purchases exceeded maturities and sales over the full year and the total investment portfolio increased by million from the end of to the end of shown below is a summary maturity distribution of the investment portfolio  which is all classified as available for sale  by type and weighted taxable equivalent yield as of december  expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

future oreo activity will depend  among other things  on how many borrowers the bank may need to foreclose upon  and the strength of the real estate market and general economic activity 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill was unchanged at million for both december  and the majority of this amount million is a result of the acquisition of americorp and its wholly owned subsidiary  american commercial bank of ventura  which was completed on september  the remaining portion represents an acquisition of a bank in paso robles dating back to in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  rather goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with a provision that states goodwill acquired in a business combination for which the acquisition date was after june  should not be amortized 
accordingly  the goodwill generated through the merger was not amortized 
management adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition  other than increasing net income by million for the year ending december   assuming that goodwill would have been amortized over a useful life of years see footnote no 
to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of significant accounting policies 
it should be noted that the results of annual assessments in future years could impact the company s results of operations or financial condition if the goodwill is considered to be impaired 
other intangibles total million at december  compared to million one year earlier 
of these amounts  million and million at december  and  respectively  represent the amortized value of the million core deposit intangible created upon the acquisition of american commercial bank 
the core deposit intangible represents the fair value of long term deposit relationships acquired and is being amortized over its expected useful economic life of years 
the remaining balance totals million and million at december  and  respectively  and represents the amortized value of the bank s originated mortgage servicing rights 
deposits while the bank is competitive with major institutions in terms of its structure of interest rates on deposit products offered  management was not overly aggressive during in terms of pricing to attract additional deposits  a decision which reflects the bank s strong liquidity at the present time 
as discussed in the income statement analysis  most of the bank s deposit rates have fallen in concert with the general decline in rates

capital capital ratios for commercial banks and their holding companies in the united states are generally calculated using three different formulas 
these calculations are referred to as the leverage ratio and two risk based calculations known as tier one risk based capital ratio and the total risk based capital ratio 
the company and the bank are subject to certain standards concerning these ratios 
these standards were developed through the joint efforts of banking authorities from different countries around the world 
the standards essentially take into account the fact that different types of assets have different levels of risk associated with them 
further  they take into account the off balance sheet exposures of banks when assessing capital adequacy 
the leverage ratio calculation simply divides common stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and certain other intangibles that a bank may have by the total assets of the bank 
in the tier one risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is the total risk weighted assets of the bank 
risk weighted assets are determined by segregating all the assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio again uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses  long term capital debt  preferred stock and other instruments 
summarized below are the capital ratios at december  and  for both mid state bancshares and mid state bank trust 
additionally  the standards for a well capitalized institution  as defined by the federal banking agencies  are displayed 
mid state bancshares mid state bank trust minimum regulatory standard well capitalized regulatory standard leverage ratio tier one risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio while it is the intent of management to continue to maintain strong capital ratios  the board of directors has initiated a stock repurchase program and increased the quarterly dividend payments in an effort to reduce its capital ratios somewhat 
without deducting for goodwill and other intangibles from equity  two other commonly followed ratios related to capital have trended as follows over the past three years 
dividend payout ratio average common equity to average assets liquidity the focus of the bank s liquidity management is to ensure its ability to meet cash requirements 
sources of liquidity include cash  due from bank balances net of federal reserve requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  fed funds sold  investment securities net of pledging requirements  loan repayments  deposits and fed funds borrowing lines 
typical demands on liquidity are deposit run off from demand deposits and savings accounts  maturing time deposits  which are not renewed  and anticipated funding under credit commitments to customers 
the bank has adequate liquidity at the present time 
its loan to deposit ratio at year end was versus one year earlier 
the bank normally strives for a loan to deposit ratio in the to range 
the bank s internally calculated liquidity ratio stands at at december   which is above its minimum policy of 
the bank strives to make high quality loans to optimize earnings while still maintaining adequate liquidity 
management s ability to maintain its loan portfolio in the desired target range will be partly dependent on the strength of the local economy 
off balance sheet and other related party transactions as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company is contingently liable for letter of credit accommodations made to its customers in the ordinary course of business totaling million at december   up from million one year earlier 
additionally  the company has undisbursed loan commitments  also made in the ordinary course of business  totaling million  which was up from the million outstanding one year earlier 
there are no special purpose entity spe trusts  corporations  or other legal entities established by mid state which reside off balance sheet 
there are no other off balance sheet items other than the aforementioned items related to letter of credit accommodations and undisbursed loan commitments 
as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company does make loans and leases to related parties directors and officers in the ordinary course of business at prevailing rates and terms 
these loans and leases totaled million at the end of compared to million one year earlier 
income statement analysis net interest income and interest rate risk net interest income is the difference between interest and fees earned on all earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for was million  up from million recorded in and million in the components of net interest income change in response to both changes in rate  average balance and mix of both earning assets and liabilities

first  the company experienced an increase in its average earning assets outstanding of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the net increase in average loans  which were up by million coupled with an increase in average investments of million and an increase in average federal funds sold of million 
second  while the company s average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  earning assets increased by a larger million 
both increases in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are largely attributable to the acquisition of american commercial bank on september  which had a larger affect on the averages of these categories in than it did in third  interest rates were considerably lower in compared to the average for for example  the prime rate averaged in compared to in fourth  there was a recovery of interest totaling million in on a loan previously charged off representing prior years interest which was recognized into interest income and unrelated to either volume or rate considerations for that year 
in  there was a million increase in interest income along with a decrease of million in interest expense compared to the resulting million increase in net interest income for is a result of similar  yet slightly different dynamics 
first  the company experienced an increase in its average earning assets outstanding of million 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to the net increase in average loans  which were up by million  while investments decreased by million and federal funds sold increased by million 
second  the company s interest bearing liabilities increased by million while earning assets increased by a larger million 
third  interest rates were considerably lower in compared to fourth  there was a recovery of interest totaling million in on a loan previously charged off representing prior years interest which was recognized into interest income and unrelated to either volume or rate considerations 
the bank expects its risk exposure to changes in interest rates to remain manageable and well within acceptable policy ranges 
a recent review as of the end of of the potential changes in the bank s net interest income over a month time horizon showed that it could fluctuate under extreme alternative rate scenarios from between and of the base case rates unchanged of million 
the bank s policy is to maintain a structure of assets and liabilities which are such that net interest income will not vary more than plus or minus of the base forecast over the next months 
management expects that its exposure to interest rate risk is manageable and it will continue to strive for an optimal trade off between risk and earnings 
the following table presents a summary of the bank s net interest income forecasted for the coming months under alternative interest rate scenarios 
change from base rates down very significant prime down to over months rates down significant prime down to over months rates down modestly prime down to over months base case rates unchanged prime unchanged at over months rates up modestly prime up to over months rates up aggressive prime up to over months rates up very aggressive prime up to over months net interest income under the above scenarios is influenced by the characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
in the case of now  savings and money market deposits total million interest is based on rates set at the discretion of management ranging from to 
in a downward rate environment  there is a limit to how far these deposit instruments can be re priced and this behavior is similar to that of fixed rate instruments 
in an upward rate environment  the magnitude and timing of changes in rates on these deposits is assumed to be more reflective of variable rate instruments 
it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitors behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior  and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the bank s net interest income 
therefore the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
historically  the bank has been able to manage its net interest income in a fairly narrow range reflecting the bank s relative insensitivity to interest rate changes 
the impact of prepayment behavior on mortgages  real estate loans  mortgage backed securities  securities with call features  etc 
is not considered material to the sensitivity analysis 
over the last years  the bank s net interest margin which is net interest income divided by average earning assets of the bank has ranged from a low of to a high of not taxable equivalent 
the bank s net interest margin in of is at the low end of this range by historical standards  coming off the higher levels experienced in of 
this is a result of both the lower level of interest rates and the change in mix of earning assets the bank now has a smaller portion in loans vis vis investment securities compared to when the margin was at its widest level 
the net interest margin under the alternative scenarios ranges from to 
management feels this range of scenarios  while lower than historical standards  is consistent with current experience and interest rate levels  but no assurances can be given that actual future experience will fall within this range 
the bank s exposure with respect to interest rate derivatives  exchange rate fluctuations  and or commodity price movements is nil 
the bank does not own any instruments within these markets 
provision for loan losses the company made contributions to the allowance for loan losses of thousand  million and thousand in  and  respectively 
this reflects management s assessment of the level of inherent losses identified in the portfolio which has been supplemented by recoveries of loans previously charged off  amounting to million annually  for  and during the rd quarter of  the effects of an economic slow down prompted management to re evaluate the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  management recommended and the board of directors authorized an additional million provision for loans losses at that time 
no additional provision for loan losses was made after june of in view of the adequacy of the allowance 
the need for additional provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
non interest income non interest income for totaled million compared to million in and million in service charges on deposit accounts increased million to million in versus this followed an increase of million in over the increase in over was mostly related to increases in service charge rates  coupled with an increase in the number of deposits accounts acquired in the american commercial bank merger 
commissions  fees and other service charges increased by million in over after a million increase in the majority of the increase in was primarily related to increased fee income from its debit cards of thousand along with increased fee income from its trust and investment division activities of thousand 
in addition  approximately thousand of the increase in was related to the bank s mastercard merchant fees 
the balance is related to modest increases across several other fee areas and the fact that reflected three months of activity generated from the newly acquired american commercial bank  whereas in  mid state benefited from their inclusion for the full year 
all other sources of income decreased to million in  after reaching million in and million in results in reflect the gain on sale of the bank s credit card portfolio in the amount of million 
management s expectation for is that most categories of non interest income will increase 
non interest expense total non interest expense for was million  which was up from million in and million in in comparing results across the three year period  it should be noted that reflects three months of activity generated by the overhead created from the acquisition of the former american commercial bank 
results for reflect a full year 
additionally  economies of scale were realized from the merger and it is estimated that the expenses of the combined institution are now approximately million per year lower than the sum of the two institutions would have been on a stand alone basis 
salaries and employee benefits increased by million in over after having increased by thousand in over the increase in over related to an increase in salaries of approximately million with the balance representing benefits cost increases 
the increase in over related to increase in salaries of approximately million and a decrease in employee benefits costs of million 
management considers containment of salaries and benefits costs in to be one of its top challenges 
a number of factors are creating unusually strong upward pressure on these costs  especially in the areas of medical benefits and competitive wages 
the company is addressing this by focusing on ways of becoming more efficient in its processes and using technology wherever possible to hold down staffing requirements 
occupancy expense has increased during this period to million in from million in and million in rental payments on leased buildings  capital expenditures for computer equipment  atm s and new signage due to the bank s name change and the merger with american commercial bank all have contributed to the increase in occupancy expense 
the new equipment and signage was placed into service in the middle of and occupancy expense increased as these items are depreciated over useful lives of between and years 
management s expectation for is that occupancy and furniture expense will increase 
plans are in motion to purchase a new mainframe computer system during the middle of replacing the old system which was acquired in and will be fully depreciated in mid  thereby improving the capability and speed of the bank s information processing 
also planned in is the purchase of new item imaging equipment which will dramatically improve checking account processing and research capabilities for customers  along with improving the efficiency of the bank 
advertising and promotion expenditures were million in following charges of million in and million in expenditures in reflect the impact of the company s name change to mid state bank trust on its th anniversary celebration in mid  the merger with american commercial bank later that year  and the donation of property in cambria in order to obtain a natural heritage state tax credit that year 
management expects results to be more in line with the normalized expenditure levels 
general office expenditures rose to million in from million in and million in this category includes primarily charges for stationery and supplies  telephone expenses  and postage 
mangement does not expect an increase in this expenditure area in as it has taken a number of steps to hold down costs related to telephone expenditures and expenditures on stationery and supplies 
moreover  the eventual implementation later in of item imaging will reduce postage costs 
merchant processing charges have increased steadily over the three year period reflecting increased volume and customers 
these charges amounted to million in  million in  and million in management s expectation for is that merchant processing expense will continue to increase due to the additional activity and volume 
regulatory assessments charges for fdic assessments and dfi fees have remained relatively constant over the past three years at   and thousand in   and  respectively 
other operating expenses increased in to million compared to million in and million in the increase in over reflects primarily the increased amortization of the core deposit intangible related to the american commercial bank acquisition thousand more for the full year of compared to the three months in 
the increase in over reflects thousand of the amortization of the core deposit intangible  a thousand increase in other operating losses  thousand of merger related charges in following none in  a thousand increase in the cost of other professional services primarily the result of contracting out internal audit services  a thousand increase in insurance costs  and a variety of smaller increases 
taxes book tax expense amounted to million in following million in and million in while the statutory tax rate of the company is  the actual rate accrued was  and in   and  respectively 
the primary reason for the difference relates to the tax exempt income generated by the company s municipal bond portfolio 
as described in footnote no 
to the financial statements  the company has deferred tax assets primarily related to the timing difference associated with charge offs and provisions for losses on certain loans and with the timing difference on deferred compensation

mid coast land company recorded a loss during of thousand compared to earnings during of thousand and thousand in the loss in was related to the write off of a note carried by the subsidiary to a developer for which no allowance had been provided based on the conditions of the loan prior to the company is in the final phases of winding down mid coast land company  having sold its final property which closed during the first quarter of msb properties  inc this wholly owned subsidiary was formed to engage in the specific business of acquiring  owning  and improving real property and tangible personal property which may be necessary or convenient for the operation or housing of the administrative departments and branch offices of the bank

the affairs of the subsidiary are managed by bank employees and as such this subsidiary has no paid staff members 
earnings for msb properties have remained relatively unchanged over the years with net earnings after tax of million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
the larger figure in reflects the net benefit to the company accounted for on the subsidiary s books of the donation of the cambria property to obtain a natural heritage state tax credit 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as  disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
management believes that the most significant subjective judgements that it is required to make include the following allowance for losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance and also employs an independent third party loan review group to  among other things  review the adequacy of the allowance and make recommendations 
management  as necessary  adjusts the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for losses unfunded commitments  on a regular basis 
these adjustments are made through a charge to expense in the provision for loan losses on the income statement 
the allowance is also examined annually by one or more of the bank s regulatory bodies including the fdic and dfi 
the need for additional provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
fair value 
where applicable  the company is required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap to disclose the fair value of financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate those fair values 
also  the fair value calculated on collateral supporting the bank s extensions of credit eg appraisals on the property securing real estate loans can have a significant effect on the determination of the adequacy of the the allowance for losses noted above 
wherever possible  fair value used by the company equals quoted market price  as for example with its investment securities portfolio  if available 
if it is not available  fair value is estimated by the company using quoted market prices for similar assets 
fair value of other instruments involves discounting future cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturity and credit characteristics
