item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements filed with this report 
overview our commercial business is focused on the dermatology marketplace  which is characterized by a large patient population that is served by relatively small  and therefore more accessible  groups of treating physicians 
we currently market two pharmaceutical products  olux and lux q 
both products have clinically proven therapeutic advantages and we are providing quality customer service to physicians through our experienced sales and marketing professionals 
in december  we received approval from the fda to sell olux for the treatment of non scalp psoriasis 
in addition to revenue from product sales  we receive royalties on sales of rid and actimmune in the us  and internationally on sales of banlice  milice  bettamousse  and on a super concentrated aerosol spray licensed worldwide 
we are also entitled to receive royalties on future sales of ridaura 
we have licenses with novartis and with pharmacia  which have the potential to bear royalties in the future depending on approval of their products for sale 
in april  we completed the acquisition of connetics australia for approximately million 
we accounted for this transaction using the purchase method and allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development  based on an independent valuation  and the balance to the tangible assets of connetics australia  existing technology and goodwill 
in april we sold our rights to ridaura  including inventory  to prometheus for million in cash plus a royalty on annual sales in excess of million for five years  resulting in a gain of million in in addition to our commercial business  we own the rights to a recombinant form of a natural hormone called relaxin 
on may   we announced our decision to reduce our investment in the development of relaxin and to search for licensing opportunities or other strategic alternatives for the product 
we eliminated employee positions related to relaxin 
in  we recorded a million charge representing estimated costs accrued in connection with the reduction in workforce and the wind down of relaxin development contracts 
in the second quarter of  we recorded an additional charge of  representing the final payment due under the agreement with boehringer ingelheim 
critical accounting policies the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to aid in that understanding  we have identified our critical accounting policies which are used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require us to make estimates and judgments due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events that are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition 
we record contract revenue for research and development as it is earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
we recognize royalty revenue in the quarter in which the royalty payment is either received from the licensee or may be reasonably estimated  which is typically one quarter following the related sale by the licensee 
we recognize non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which we have no continuing involvement  on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
commencing january   we recognize revenue from non refundable upfront license fees ratably over the period in which we have continuing development obligations when  at the time the agreement is executed  there remains significant risk due to the incomplete state of the product s development 
revenue associated with substantial at risk performance milestones  as defined in the respective agreements  is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones 
we recognize revenue under r d cost reimbursement contracts as the related costs are incurred 

table of contents returns  rebates and chargebacks reserves 
we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns  rebates and chargeback payments 
these estimates determine our revenue reserves 
we make these estimates based primarily on our past return  rebate and chargeback experience 
we also consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  trends in distributor inventory  economic trends that might impact patient demand for our products including competitive environment  the economic value of the rebates being offered and other factors 
in the past  actual returns  rebates and chargebacks have not generally exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns  rebates and chargebacks in the future period are inherently uncertain 
any changes in our medicaid liability  any increase in returns  as well as increased usage of our products through managed care programs  will affect the amount of rebates that we owe 
if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
in addition  if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported revenue 
goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets impairment assessments 
we make judgments about the recoverability of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet 
to judge the fair value of long lived assets  we make various assumptions about the value of the business that the asset relates to and typically estimate future cash flows to be generated by the asset or  in the case of goodwill  the enterprise 
this may include assumptions about future prospects for the asset and typically involves computation of the estimated future cash flows to be generated 
based on these judgments and assumptions  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its actual fair value 
judgments and assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the judgments and assumptions we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different judgments and assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these assets would result in greater impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions would result in smaller impairment charges and higher asset values 
for more details about how we make these judgments  see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenues years ended december  in thousands product olux lux q ridaura other total product revenues license  contract and royalty royalty pharmacia novartis intermune celltech formerly medeva other contracts total license  contract and royalty revenues total revenues 
table of contents our product revenues were million in compared to million in and million in we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks 
the increase in total product revenue in was due to continued sales growth of olux and lux q 
this increase was the result of volume and price increases  partially offset by increases in our revenue allowances 
the increase in total product revenue in over was due to sales growth of lux q  and to our first full year of sales of olux  which we launched in november we also recognized product revenue on sales of ridaura until the april sale of that product line to prometheus 
effective april   in connection with our agreement with intermune  we sold our remaining actimmune product rights 
when we acquired connetics australia in april  we began to recognize product revenue on some over the counter products they sell and royalty revenue in association with royalty bearing contracts to which connetics australia is a party 
license  contract  royalty and other revenues were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in royalty revenue from to was primarily related to increased sales of an aerosol spray product that we have licensed to a third party 
the increase in license revenue in from was partially due to revenue recognized in association with an agreement we entered into in december with pharmacia corporation and an expanded license agreement with novartis 
the agreement with pharmacia granted pharmacia exclusive global rights  excluding japan  to our proprietary foam drug delivery technology for use in pharmacia s rogaine hair loss treatment 
we recognized million under the pharmacia agreement in the agreement with novartis expanded the existing global license to novartis consumer health to cover liquipatch drug delivery system for use in topical antifungal applications 
novartis will continue to be responsible for all product development cost  and pay us license fees  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognized  of revenue related to this agreement in the quarter ended march  the decrease in license revenue in from was in part due to our decision in may to reduce our investment in the development of relaxin 
through the end of  we had not entered into any new licensing opportunities or other strategic alternatives for relaxin 
effective april  we assigned to intermune our remaining rights and obligations under a license with genentech for actimmune and the corresponding supply agreement 
in exchange  intermune paid us approximately million in intermune paid an additional  by the end of march  which was offset by related product rebates and chargebacks of  in august  we entered into an agreement with intermune to terminate our exclusive option for certain rights in the dermatology field in exchange for an up front  non refundable payment of  we recognized the full amount of this revenue in we anticipate that product revenue will increase in due to continued sales growth of olux and lux q 
we also anticipate that license and contract revenue will decrease  as several revenue streams from will not recur in  while royalty revenue is expected to remain about the same in beyond  we expect license revenue to fluctuate significantly depending on whether we enter into additional collaborations  when and whether we or our partners achieve milestones under existing agreements  and the timing of any new business opportunities that we may identify 
cost of product revenues our cost of product revenues includes the third party costs of manufacturing olux  lux q  ridaura until april  and actimmune until april  royalty payments based on a percentage of our product revenues and product freight and distribution costs from sps  the third party that handles all of our product distribution activities 
we recorded cost of product revenues of million in compared to million in and million in the increase in total cost of product revenues in was the result of an increase in sales volumes 
on a percentage basis  cost of product revenues decreased to in from in when we acquired connetics australia  we began to eliminate all intercompany transactions in consolidation  which included our royalty expense and connetics australia s related royalty income 
the decrease in cost of product revenues from to on a percentage basis was primarily due to the elimination of intercompany royalties  partially offset by an increase in the cost per unit of our products 
the decrease in cost of product revenues from to was primarily due to the elimination of intercompany royalties  as well as a change in product mix as a result of discontinuing sales of ridaura  which had higher manufacturing costs than our other products 
we sold the rights to ridaura to prometheus in april 
table of contents we anticipate a slight increase in the cost of product revenues in  on a per unit basis as we shift the production of our products to domestic suppliers 
research and development research and development expenses include costs of personnel to support our research and development activities  costs of preclinical studies  costs of conducting our clinical trials  such as clinical investigator fees  monitoring costs  data management and drug supply costs  external research programs  and an allocation of facilities costs  salaries and benefits  and overhead costs such as rent  supplies and utilities 
research and development expenses increased in to million  compared to million in and million in in  our research and development expenses primarily consisted of million on preclinical and clinical research in the development of new dermatology products  million on quality assurance and quality control in the enhancement of existing dermatology products  million on the optimization of manufacturing and process development for existing dermatology products  million on manufacturing  process development and optimization of dermatology products under development  million on quality assurance and quality control in the development of new dermatology products  million on basic research and formulation of new dermatology products  and million on the regulatory review of new and existing dermatology products 
in  our research and development expenses primarily consisted of million on new dermatology product efforts  million on relaxin development efforts prior to the may decision to reduce investment in the program  million on development efforts to expand the usage of existing dermatology products  and million to integrate connetics australia into our research and development efforts from april in  our research and development expenses primarily consisted of million toward the manufacturing scale up of relaxin  million for conducting a phase ii iii trial of relaxin for the treatment of scleroderma  million for increased personnel in our organization  and million in expenses associated with the initiation of clinical trials of relaxin 

table of contents we are currently conducting research on a number of potential therapeutic products for new indications that are in various phases of clinical and pre clinical development 
pharmaceutical research and development programs  by their nature  require a substantial amount of financial and human resources and the fda may not approve our product candidates for marketing 
the costs to develop all of our potential drugs through all clinical phases would cost substantially more than the funds currently available to us 
we are unable to predict the level of spending until near the end of the various programs because of the uncertainty of fda approval of clinical study programs 
we caution that many of our development efforts could experience delays  setbacks and failures  with no assurance that any of our clinical research will reach the stage of an nda or that the nda will be approved 
the following table sets forth the status of  and costs attributable to  our current research and clinical development programs 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the discussion of clinical risks set forth in factors affecting our business and prospects 
clinical development is inherently uncertain and expense levels may fluctuate unexpectedly because we cannot accurately predict the timing and level of such expenses 
research and estimated development expenses description indication phase of development completion of phase iii through extina 
foam phase iii mid million formulation of ketoconazole for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis actiza 
foam phase iii late million formulation of clindamycin for the treatment of acne velac 
gel phase iii mid million formulation of clindamycin and tretinoin for the treatment of acne excluding license and milestone payments to yamanouchi pre clinical research pre clinical n a million and development for multiple dermatological indications pharmaceutical products that we develop internally can take several years to research  develop and bring to market in the united states 
we cannot reliably estimate the overall completion dates or total costs to complete our major research and development programs 
the clinical development portion of these programs can span several years and any estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products 
the fda defines the steps required to develop a drug in the us clinical development typically involves three phases of study  and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see factors affecting our business and prospects we cannot sell our current products and product candidates if we do not obtain and maintain governmental approvals and we may spend a significant amount of money to obtain fda and other regulatory approvals  which may never be granted and if we are unable to develop new products  our expenses may continue to exceed our revenue indefinitely  without any return on the investment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase in over was primarily due to 
table of contents million increase compared to related to the introduction of product samples  million increase compared to in labor and benefit expenses due to increased head count as well as having a full year of expanded sales force compared to eight months in  and an increase compared to in depreciation expenses related to equipment purchased to support increased headcount  as well as a full year of depreciation related to equipment supporting the expanded sales force  partially offset by million in non cash stock compensation expense in that did not recur in the increase in over was primarily due to the addition of employees in our sales and marketing organizations  additional market research and sales costs related to the olux launch and the launch of olux and lux q gram units  million for the amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of connetics australia in  and million in non cash stock compensation charges 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain consistent or be slightly higher in due to the commencement of marketing efforts relating to the anticipated outcome of clinical trials for antifungal foam and anti acne foam 
acquired in process research and development in may  we entered into an agreement with yamanouchi europe bv to license velac gel a first in class combination of clindamycin  and tretinoin 
we have licensed exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the product in the us and canada  and have licensed non exclusive rights in mexico 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid yamanouchi an initial million licensing fee  which we recorded as acquired in process research and development expense during the quarter ended june   because the product remains in clinical development and has no alternative future use 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase iii trial for velac 
under the terms of the agreement  we recorded an additional million of acquired in process research and development expense related to this milestone 
in april  we completed the acquisition of connetics australia then known as soltec for approximately million 
we accounted for this transaction using the purchase method and allocated million of the purchase price to acquired in process research and development  based on an independent valuation  and the balance to the tangible assets of connetics australia  existing developed technology and goodwill 
acquired in process research and development consisted of several projects  which involved the use of novel technologies to improve the delivery of drugs 
the projects were and still are in various stages of development and are subject to substantial risks  and did not have alternative future uses 
the value of the in process research and development was determined by an independent valuation expert using a discounted cash flow analysis with a rate of 
in addition  the stage of completion of each project was considered in determining the value 
these projects may not meet either technological or commercial success 
the products under development have no foreseeable alternative future uses 
the estimates we used in valuing in process research and development were based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but they are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the results projected for purposes of determining the fair value of the acquired in process research and development 

table of contents loss on program termination relaxin in the second quarter of we recorded a million charge representing estimated costs accrued in connection with the reduction in workforce and the wind down of relaxin development contracts 
in the fourth quarter of we reversed million of this charge due to the settlement of potential amounts owed 
in the second quarter of we recorded an additional charge of  representing the final payment due under an agreement with boehringer ingelheim 
for additional information  see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the relationship with boehringer ingelheim 
interest and other income expense  net interest income was  for  compared to million for and million for the decrease in interest income in from was the result of lower cash and investment balances  combined with a decrease in market interest rates on investments 
the increase in interest income in over arose from the high cash and investment balance which arose from the sale of intermune shares in december interest expense was  in  compared to  in and  in interest expense in was primarily related to a financing arrangement associated with our corporate insurance policies 
there were no capital leases outstanding during the decrease in interest expense in over resulted from lower interest expense associated with lower balances outstanding for obligations under capital leases  and long term debt 
other income expense was a net income of  in compared to a net expense of  in and zero in the net other income in was directly related to the rents received from two sublease arrangements 
the net other expense in was primarily due to a  net loss on a foreign exchange forward contract partially offset by rents received from a sublease arrangement 
the contract was entered into in relation to a business combination and does not qualify as a hedge under sfas the purpose of the contract was to lock in the purchase price paid for connetics australia 
the foreign exchange forward contract was terminated on the closing date of the acquisition of connetics australia 
income taxes income tax expense was  in compared to  in and million in income tax expense for reflects  of foreign tax provision recorded by connetics australia  substantially offset by a us tax benefit of  the us tax benefit arose principally because of the provisions of the job creation and worker assistance act of enacted on march   which allows taxpayers to carry back net operating losses generated in and to offset alternative minimum tax previously paid 
income tax expense in arose from the taxable operating results of connetics australia 
the income tax provision for consisted of alternative minimum tax paid as a result of a million gain from the sale of securities 
for a more complete description of our income tax position  refer to note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
change in accounting principle effective january   we changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable up front license fees to recognize such fees over the expected research and development period 
the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of january   was reported as a charge in the year ended december  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue over the research and development period of the agreements 
during the year ended december   the impact of this change in accounting method excluding the cumulative effect itself increased net income by million or per share 
this increase consists of million revenue deferred in the cumulative effect that was recognized as income in under the new accounting method  offset by the impact of deferring upfront fees received in during  approximately million of revenue deferred as a component of the cumulative effect charge was fully recognized in the fourth quarter when two of our collaboration partners terminated their agreements with us as a result of the failure of relaxin to meet the primary endpoint in a phase iii trial  and we were released from further obligations 
revenue for both and includes  of revenue previously 
table of contents recognized and included in the cumulative effect adjustment 
the unamortized balance of deferred revenue at december   of approximately  is expected to be recognized as revenue of approximately  per year during the years ending through the pro forma amounts presented in the statement of operations were calculated assuming the accounting change had been in effect for prior periods  and was made retroactive to prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources sources and use of cash 
we have financed our operations to date primarily through proceeds from equity financings  sale of investments  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  bank loans  and product revenues 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  and million at december  accounts receivable  net  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  our cash balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including high grade corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operations was million for compared to million for and million in net loss of million for was affected by non cash charges of million of depreciation and amortization expense and a million gain on the sale of investments 
cash usage was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million related to timing of sales and collection of outstanding amounts  and an increase in accounts payable of approximately million related to increased development costs 
net loss of million for was affected by non cash charges of million of depreciation and amortization expense and  in other expense related to the foreign exchange forward contract  acquired in process research and development charge of million related to the connetics australia acquisition  a one time million charge related to the reduction in the relaxin program  and non cash compensation charges in the amount of million  more than offset by the million gain on the sale of the ridaura product line 
the primary reason for the decrease in operating cash flows in was that we had a  gain on the sale of intermune stock in compared to a million gain in and an unfavorable change in working capital accounts in of approximately million 
net income of million for was affected by the gain on sale of intermune stock of million  partially offset by non cash charges of  of depreciation and amortization expense and million non cash compensation expense 
cash flows from investing activities 
investing activities provided million in cash during compared to cash used in investing activities of million in cash during and million provided by investing activities in the principal source of cash from investing activities in was net sales of short term investments  which was partially offset by the use of cash to construct an aerosol filling line at dpt s plant in texas 
the principal uses of cash for investing activities in were net purchases of short term investments and the acquisition of connetics australia  which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the ridaura product line 
cash flows from financing activities 
financing activities provided million in cash during compared to cash used in financing activities of  in and to cash provided by financing activities of million in the principal sources of cash from financing activities in were proceeds from the sale of common stock of million pursuant to the exercise of warrants and stock options and the million reduction of restricted cash in connection with the requirements of an operating lease arrangement and collateral on various officer loans 
working capital working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  our working capital primarily decreased as we used cash in operations and for the purchase of acquired in process research and development 
working capital decreased to million at december  
table of contents from million at december  our working capital primarily decreased as we used cash in operations and acquired connetics australia 
the decrease was partially offset by the sale of the ridaura product line 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total years operating leases million million million million million financing arrangement million million contractual commitments million million million million million total contractual cash obligations million million million million million we lease laboratory and office facilities under noncancelable operating leases  which expire through in march we entered into an agreement with dpt to construct an aerosol filling line at dpt s plant in texas 
under the agreement we are obligated to pay approximately  per year in rent  for an indefinite period of time  for the pro rata portion of dpt s facility allocated to the aerosol line 
we also lease various automobiles and office equipment under similar leases  expiring through these obligations are to be partially offset by  to be received from subleasing arrangements with third parties 
in we entered into short term financing arrangements related to our corporate insurance policies 
all remaining amounts related to these financing arrangements will be paid in and have been included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
in march we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with dpt that requires minimum purchase commitments  beginning six months after the opening of the commercial production line and continuing for years 
also in we entered into a license agreement that requires minimum royalty payments beginning in and continuing for fifteen years 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements or commitments other than those disclosed in the table above 
restricted cash and cash equivalents 
as of december    of our total cash and cash equivalents balance was restricted cash  held in various certificates of deposit  for specific purposes  relates to collateral on a personal bank loan to one of our officers  and  relates to a deposit required in connection with a noncancelable operating lease 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash generated from product sales and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the next months 
future revenues from sales are uncertain as we are subject to patent risks and competition from new products  and products under development may not be safe and effective or approved by the fda  or we may not be able to produce them in commercial quantities at reasonable costs  and the products may not gain satisfactory market acceptance 
our future capital uses and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the level of product revenues  and the possible acquisition of new products and technologies 
a key element of our strategy is to in license or acquire additional marketed or late stage development products 
a portion of the funds needed to acquire  develop and market any new products may come from our existing cash  which will result in fewer resources available to our current products and clinical programs 
we are currently evaluating a number of business development opportunities  including the possibility of acquiring or in licensing other products 
if we successfully reach agreements with third parties  these transactions may require us to use some of our available cash  or to raise additional cash by liquidating some of our investment portfolio and or raising additional funds through equity or debt financings in connection with the transaction 

table of contents we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our other products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs

specifically  sfas requires that companies record the costs to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets when those costs are incurred 
sfas requires that the measurement of the liability be at fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  upon the adoption of sfas  previously issued financial statements shall not be restated 
we will assess the impact of adoption of sfas based on the nature of transactions ongoing at the adoption date 
sfas in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that changes to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting to require expanded and more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
however  the disclosure provisions of sfas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for the compensation using the fair value method of sfas or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
fin in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
our business strategy may cause fluctuating operating results our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending upon the relative timing of events or uncertainties that may arise 
for example  the following events or occurrences could cause fluctuations in our financial performance from period to period changes in the levels we spend to develop new product lines  
table of contents changes in the amount we spend to promote our products  changes in treatment practices of physicians that currently prescribe our products  changes in reimbursement policies of health plans and other similar health insurers  forward buying patterns by wholesalers that may result in significant quarterly swings in revenue reporting  increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products  the development of new competitive products by others  the mix of products that we sell during any time period  and our responses to price competition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our holdings of financial instruments comprise a mix of securities that may include us corporate debt  us government debt  and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
the average time to maturity of our investments is days 
generally  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to reductions in interest rates 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  in thousands total fair value available for sale securities weighted average annual interest rate foreign currency exchange risk 
certain payments by third parties to connetics australia are made in local currency or australian dollars  and payments by connetics australia to celltech in the uk are made in australian dollars 
any fluctuations in the currencies of our licensees or licensors against the australian or the us dollar will cause our royalty revenues and expenses to fluctuate as well 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest income from our investments is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we face minimal material market risk exposure
