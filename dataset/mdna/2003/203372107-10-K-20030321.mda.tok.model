we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer and marketer of a wide array of broadband coaxial cables and other high performance electronic and fiber optic cable products for cable television  telephony  internet access  wireless communications and other broadband services 
we believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of coaxial cable for hybrid fiber coaxial hfc broadband networks 
we are also a leading supplier of coaxial  twisted pair and fiber optic cables for premise wiring local area networks  wireless and other communication applications 
effective november   we acquired  through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary commscope optical  an approximate interest in ofs brightwave  a delaware limited liability company  formed by us and furukawa to operate certain fiber optic cable and transmission fiber assets of the ofs group acquired from lucent 
we issued million shares of our common stock to lucent  valued at million in aggregate  in lieu of a portion of the cash purchase price payable by furukawa to lucent pursuant to an asset and stock purchase agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of a portion of lucent s ofs group 
of the amount paid by us  million represented our capital contribution to ofs brightwave and the remaining million represented a revolving loan from commscope optical to ofs brightwave 
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of furukawa owns the remaining equity interest in ofs brightwave 
the businesses acquired include transmission fiber and cable manufacturing capabilities at a million square foot facility in norcross  georgia  as well as facilities in germany and brazil  an interest in a joint venture in carrollton  georgia and an interest in a joint venture in russia 
we expect our investment in ofs brightwave and other arrangements with furukawa and its subsidiaries to provide access to optical fiber  including premium fiber  under a supply agreement  enhance our technology platform with access to key intellectual property  and create a strategic partner in optical fiber and fiber optic cable manufacturing 
as of october   we and furukawa purchased million shares of our common stock from lucent for  or per share 
of the total million shares of our common stock purchased from lucent  furukawa purchased approximately million shares for million and we purchased approximately million shares for million 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  distributor price protection reserves  reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances  and rebates  income tax valuation allowances  and impairment reviews for investments  fixed assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is at least reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
management believes the following critical accounting policies require its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s estimates related to doubtful accounts 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  inventory levels in the distributor channel  and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  declining market conditions could result in increased estimates of sales returns and allowances and potential distributor price protection incentives  resulting in incremental reductions to revenue 
we maintain allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these estimates are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
we do not believe our products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels in response to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions become less favorable than anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
management reviews intangible assets  investments  and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of august and on an interim basis when events or circumstances change 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected to arise from these assets 
future cash flows may be adversely impacted by operating performance  market conditions  and other factors 
if an impairment is indicated by this analysis  the impairment charge to be recognized  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if actual future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
discussion of impairment charges is located under the heading impairment charges for fixed assets and investments within the comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  the results of our transitional goodwill impairment test and our first annual goodwill impairment test are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
financial highlights year ended december  net income loss    net income loss per share assuming dilution comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased million or to million  from the decrease in net sales was mainly due to the challenging global business environment in telecommunications  which continues to result in reduced demand for many product lines both domestically and internationally 
additionally  net sales were impacted by reduced shipments to adelphia communications corporation  referred to herein as adelphia  and ongoing competitive pricing pressures for fiber optic cable  wireless and other telecommunications products 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by broad product group as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and of of net net net net sales sales sales sales broadband video products lan products wireless other telecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales for the year ended december   international sales decreased million  or  to million  from  with sales down year over year in nearly all regions primarily due to the difficult global business environment 
while we believe that near term international sales will be depressed until the global economy improves  we remain optimistic about the long term global opportunities for broadband cable 
net sales of broadband and other video distribution products  referred to herein as broadband video products  for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes  and was significantly affected by the downturn in international demand 
comcast corporation merged with at t broadband in november  to create a new company named comcast corporation  referred to herein as comcast 
during the year ended december   comcast  as if combined with at t broadband for the full year  accounted for approximately of our net sales  compared to approximately of our net sales as if they were combined for the full year ended december  the impact of increased sales to comcast  on a pro forma basis for the full year  was more than offset by lower shipments to adelphia and charter communications  inc  referred to herein as charter  in addition to lower sales of fiber optic cable 
domestic broadband video sales decreased approximately year over year 
the decrease in domestic sales of broadband video products was driven primarily by reduced shipments to adelphia and charter and significant pricing pressures for fiber optic cable 
sales of fiber optic cable  primarily for broadband applications  represented more than of total sales in during  we enhanced our fiber optic market position for hfc applications despite lower overall sales and significant pricing pressure 
while we expect the market for fiber optic cable to remain difficult during  we believe that our ability to offer both coaxial and fiber optic cable  as well as other types of communications cables  continues to be an important competitive advantage 
net sales of local area network and other data application products  referred to herein as lan products  for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from the decrease was primarily driven by lower volume resulting from year end inventory reductions by distributors and pricing pressure due to difficult market conditions 
although our sales were impacted by the loss of graybar electric company  inc  previously one of our leading distribution channels for lan and other video related products  we believe that we were able to offset the lost sales in lan products by redirecting project business and utilizing our strong brand recognition 
net sales of wireless and other telecommunications products  referred to herein as wireless and other telecom products  for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from  primarily due to the combination of lower volume and pricing pressure 
we expect ongoing softness and significant competitive pressures for our wireless and other telecom products 
the general slowdown in telecommunications capital spending and the inability of certain customers to get financing for their projects has had a significant impact on sales of our wireless products  and we continue to experience aggressive competition in the wireless market 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for  a decrease of 
gross profit margin decreased over basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily due to lower sales volumes and competitive pricing pressure for certain products  including fiber optic cable and lan products 
management expects the rising cost of raw materials such as plastics and polymers  which are derived from oil and natural gas  to result in increased cost of sales 
although the company expects to recover these costs by raising prices of certain products  the inability to do so could result in lower gross profit and gross profit margin 
we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or  during the third quarter of in december  we announced an additional reduction of our workforce of approximately employees  or  that was effective in january the reductions were primarily in response to the challenging global business environment 
we recorded total pretax charges related to these workforce reductions of approximately million in cost of sales for employee termination benefits during we intend to continue evaluating all aspects of our business and to take appropriate action to position us for long term success and strong competitiveness 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative  referred to herein as sg a  expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from the increase in sg a expense was primarily due to the increase in bad debt expense related to the write off of adelphia receivables in  which totaled million 
excluding the adelphia write off  sg a expense declined slightly for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we believe we have taken appropriate charges for doubtful accounts as a result of the difficult market environment based on our analysis of customer financial difficulties  age of receivable balances  and other relevant factors 
for the year ended december   sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was  or excluding the write off of adelphia receivables  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales  excluding the write off of adelphia receivables in  was primarily due to sales declining faster than sales and marketing expenses  as well as our ongoing investment in our information technology infrastructure 
we plan to continue investing in our information technology infrastructure in order to further differentiate our service model through technology 
we also intend to continue to fund domestic and international sales and marketing efforts in order to enhance our competitive position around the world in anticipation of improving global economic conditions 
research and development research and development expense as a percentage of net sales remained stable at for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  our major projects consisted of research and engineering activities related to developing new and more cost effective cable designs 
also  we continued research and engineering activities related to the production of certain copper clad metals in order to advance the design of those materials and related processes to the point that they meet specific functional and economic requirements 
we undertook this project in an effort to reduce material costs and reliance on limited sources of key raw materials and incorporated the new designs and related processes into production during the third quarter of we expect research and development expense to remain at approximately of net sales in the near term 
terminated acquisition costs our acquisition of an ownership interest in ofs brightwave as of november  was restructured from a previously contemplated joint venture arrangement announced july  under the originally contemplated arrangement  we would have formed two joint ventures with furukawa to acquire certain fiber optic cable and transmission fiber assets of lucent s ofs group 
given the uncertain economic environment and severe downturn in the telecommunications market as well as associated difficulties in the financing markets following the september  tragedy  we agreed with furukawa to restructure the joint venture arrangements  resulting in a reduced ownership participation for us 
as a result of the restructuring of this venture  we recorded pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  during  related to financing and formation costs of the original joint venture arrangements  which are not capitalizable as part of our investment in the restructured venture 
impairment charges for fixed assets and investments effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains many of its fundamental provisions 
long lived assets must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
due to the difficult business environment in telecommunications and the continuing decline in demand for our products  we performed a test of recoverability for our long lived assets during the third quarter of as a result of this impairment test  we recognized pretax impairment charges for fixed assets in the amount of million  or per share  net of tax  during the break down of these impairment charges was as follows in millions wireless cable manufacturing assets fiber optic cable manufacturing assets other telecommunications cable manufacturing assets other manufacturing assets total impairment charges our long term undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicated that the carrying amounts of fixed assets used to manufacture our wireless  fiber optic cable and other telecom products may not be recoverable as of september  in addition  our quarterly review of idle and obsolete fixed assets indicated additional impairment for specifically identified manufacturing equipment 
the impairment loss recognized in the third quarter of was measured as the amount by which the carrying values of the impaired assets exceeded their respective fair values 
fair values were determined using the best available information  including independent appraisal  third party and internal market value estimates  and discounted cash flows 
during we recorded pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  related to the impairment of certain assets 
management identified specific assets that were determined to have no future use in our operations and assets whose anticipated undiscounted future cash flows were less than their carrying values 
these impairment adjustments included equipment charges and a write down of our kings mountain facility  which was under construction 
equipment that was intended for the kings mountain facility is being held for possible deployment internationally 
the impairment charges also included the write off of an investment in a wireless infrastructure project management company  now in the process of being liquidated  whose fair value was determined to be zero 
the tax benefit of the capital loss arising from impairment of this investment has been offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty about our ability to utilize this tax deduction 
net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances on long term debt and lower variable interest rates 
we expect net interest expense to remain relatively stable in  as compared to income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the years ended december  and we expect the effective income tax rate for to remain at approximately 
equity in losses of ofs brightwave  llc for the year ended december   our equity interest in the losses of ofs brightwave was approximately million  pretax 
for the six week period from november  to december   our equity interest in the losses of ofs brightwave was approximately million  pretax 
since ofs brightwave has elected to be taxed as a partnership  we recorded a tax benefit related to our equity interest in the flow through losses of approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the six week period ended december  although ofs brightwave benefited from revenue expansion and cost reduction efforts during  ofs brightwave operates in some of the same markets we do and its financial results were also adversely affected by the downturn in the global economy and the telecommunications industry 
due primarily to these conditions  ofs brightwave incurred losses of million during the year ended december   nearly half of which resulted from charges for the write off of goodwill and certain fixed assets  restructuring and employee separation costs and other cost reduction activities 
the total of these charges recognized by ofs brightwave during was million  net of a million tax benefit from losses generated by a domestic c corporation subsidiary of ofs brightwave 
the losses of approximately million incurred by ofs brightwave during the six week period ended december  were impacted by nonrecurring startup and organizational costs of approximately million  related to the write off of in process research and development  separation from lucent and commencement of independent operations 
in addition  ofs brightwave is party to manufacturing and supply agreements with ofs fitel  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of furukawa 
as a result of furukawa s controlling interest in both ventures  it has significant influence over the structure and pricing of these agreements 
future changes in these terms  over which we have limited influence  could have a material impact on the profitability of ofs brightwave and ultimately on our results of operations 
due primarily to the difficult market environment for certain telecommunications products and challenging global economic conditions  we expect ongoing pricing pressure and weak demand industry wide for fiber optic cable products during based on these expectations  we believe that ofs brightwave will incur losses in the near term  and that as a result we will continue to recognize noncash equity method losses from our investment in ofs brightwave 
despite these recent losses  we believe our investment in ofs brightwave and our strategic relationship with furukawa have enhanced our competitive position with the domestic broadband and lan service providers 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased million or to million  from the decrease in net sales was mainly due to deteriorating global economic conditions which resulted in declining demand and competitive pricing pressures for some product lines both domestically and internationally 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by broad product group as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and of of net net net net sales sales sales sales broadband video products lan products wireless othertelecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales for the year ended december   international sales decreased million  or  to million  from  with sales down year over year in all regions primarily due to the difficult global environment 
during  we opened a new manufacturing facility in brazil  which we expect will enhance our competitive position in latin america  especially when this region s economy improves 
net sales of broadband video products for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes  and was significantly affected by the downturn in international demand 
increases in sales to most of the large domestic broadband service providers were more than offset by substantial decreases in sales to alternate service providers and to at t broadband 
domestic broadband video sales decreased approximately year over year 
the decrease in broadband video products sales volume was somewhat offset by modest price increases for certain hfc products 
sales were also positively affected by a favorable shift in product mix resulting from sales of fiber optic cable  primarily for broadband applications  which represented approximately of total sales in however  sales of fiber optic cable slowed during the second half of as a result of challenging market conditions and competitive pricing pressures 
net sales of lan products for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from the increase was primarily due to a favorable shift to more enhanced products at higher unit prices  offset by a decline in unit volume 
net pricing was not a significant factor in the year over year increase in sales of lan products 
we began implementing a comprehensive performance improvement plan for our lan products group during the fourth quarter of this plan included  among other things  reorganizing lan sales and operational management as well as ongoing efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory  improve efficiency  and increase the velocity of the manufacturing and distribution cycle 
this reorganization resulted in growth in both sales and profitability of our lan products and we believe it has improved our ability to provide world class network cabling solutions to our domestic customers 
net sales of wireless and other telecom products for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from  primarily due to lower sales of other telecom products related to telephone central office applications 
the decrease in sales of other telecom products was primarily driven by lower volumes  offset somewhat by a favorable shift in product mix 
sales of wireless products were down significantly year over year primarily due to the general slowdown in telecommunications capital spending and the inability of certain customers to get financing for their projects 
the decrease in sales of wireless products was primarily driven by lower volumes  and was impacted somewhat by an unfavorable shift in product mix 
during we expanded our global capacity in the wireless market and now have production capability in latin america and europe 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for  a decrease of 
gross profit margin decreased over basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily due to lower sales volumes 
changes in material costs did not have a significant impact on gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from the year over year increase in sg a expense was primarily due to increased charges for doubtful accounts and ongoing investment in our information technology infrastructure 
we recorded charges for doubtful accounts in the amount of approximately million in compared to million in we believe we have taken appropriate charges for doubtful accounts as a result of the difficult market environment based on our analysis of customer financial difficulties  age of receivable balances  and other relevant factors 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a  expense was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to sales declining faster than sales and marketing expenses  as well as the factors discussed above 
research and development research and development expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the substantial completion of certain aspects of our vertical integration projects for bimetallic wire fabrication and fine wire drawing in during  our major projects consisted primarily of research and engineering activity related to the production of copper clad metals required to advance the design of those materials and related processes to the point that they meet specific functional and economic requirements and are ready for full scale manufacturing 
we have undertaken these projects as part of our vertical integration strategy in an effort to reduce materials costs and reliance on limited sources of key raw materials 
terminated acquisition costs our acquisition of an ownership interest in ofs brightwave as of november  was restructured from a previously contemplated joint venture arrangement announced july  under the originally contemplated arrangement  we would have formed two joint ventures with furukawa to acquire certain fiber optic cable and transmission fiber assets of lucent s ofs group 
given the uncertain economic environment and severe downturn in the telecommunications market as well as associated difficulties in the financing markets following the september  tragedy  we agreed with furukawa to restructure the joint venture arrangements  resulting in a reduced ownership participation for us 
as a result of the restructuring of this venture  we recorded pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  during  related to financing and formation costs of the original joint venture arrangements  which are not capitalizable as part of our investment in the restructured venture 
impairment charges for fixed assets and investments during  we took a number of steps to manage costs and evaluated all aspects of our business in response to challenging industry conditions 
as a result of our review  we recorded pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  during the year ended december  related to the impairment of certain assets 
management identified specific assets that were determined to have no future use in our operations and assets whose anticipated undiscounted future cash flows were less than their carrying values 
these impairment adjustments included equipment charges and a write down of our kings mountain facility  which was under construction 
equipment that was intended for the kings mountain facility is being held for possible deployment internationally 
the impairment charges also included the write off of an investment in a wireless infrastructure project management company  now in the process of being liquidated  whose fair value was determined to be zero 
the tax benefit of the capital loss arising from impairment of this investment has been offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty about our ability to utilize this tax deduction 
other income expense  net other income expense  net for the year ended december  included a pretax gain of thousand related to the final liquidation of a closed australian joint venture 
this joint venture was completely dissolved as of december   when the deregistration period required by the australian legal authorities expired 
net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances on long term debt and lower variable interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily a result of certain tax savings strategies 
the benefit of these strategies was offset by valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets related to a capital loss carryforward on an investment and a foreign net operating loss carryforward  the realization of which is considered to be uncertain 
equity in losses of ofs brightwave  llc for the six week period from november  to december   our equity interest in the losses of ofs brightwave was approximately million  pretax 
since ofs brightwave has elected to be taxed as a partnership  we have recorded a tax benefit of approximately million related to our equity interest in the flow through losses 
the losses of approximately million incurred by ofs brightwave during the six week period ended december  were impacted by nonrecurring startup and organizational costs of approximately million  related to the write off of in process research and development  separation from lucent and commencement of independent operations 
ofs brightwave operates in the same markets we do and its financial results were also adversely affected by the downturn in the global economy and the telecommunications industry 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity both on a short term and long term basis are cash and cash equivalents  cash flows provided by operations and availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility  referred to herein as secured credit facility 
reduced sales and profitability could reduce cash provided by operations and limit availability under the secured credit facility 
in addition  increases in working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  related to increasing sales could reduce our operating cash flows in the short term until cash collections of accounts receivable catch up to the higher level of billings 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this year over year decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to a smaller reduction in working capital in  compared to  primarily due to lower sales 
the year over year decrease in income before noncash charges for depreciation  amortization  asset impairment  and equity method losses also contributed to the decrease in operating cash flow in  compared to working capital increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to the increase in our cash balance of million to as of december  excluding cash and cash equivalents  working capital decreased by primarily due to a decline in sales which resulted in reduced accounts receivable and inventory 
however  we reduced the number of days outstanding in our accounts receivable during and our inventory turnover also improved as a result of our efforts to improve production efficiency 
during the year ended december   we invested million in equipment and facilities compared to million in capital expenditures in included the acquisition of a previously leased corporate office building for million 
the additional capital spending during and was primarily for projects related to vertical integration  capacity expansion  and equipment upgrades 
in  we completed an aggressive three year capacity expansion program that increased our overall production capability in order to position ourselves to meet anticipated worldwide demand for hfc products 
while we may place additional production capability in important international markets  we expect capital expenditures to remain at a level below depreciation and amortization expense for the next several years 
we currently expect capital expenditures to be in the range of to million in  primarily for cost reduction efforts and information technology initiatives  depending upon business conditions 
we owed total long term debt of million  or of our book capital structure  defined as long term debt  including current portion  and total stockholders equity  as of december   compared to million  including current portion  or of our book capital structure as of december  the decrease in long term debt was due to principal repayments under our eurodollar credit agreement  which was terminated by us on december  quarterly principal payments of million and the final principal repayment of million were offset by the realization of a foreign currency gain of million  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  on this foreign currency denominated debt 
we also terminated the interest rate swap agreement that served as a fixed rate hedge of the variable rate borrowings under our eurodollar credit agreement effective as of december   resulting in an immaterial after tax loss 
as of november   we terminated our amended million revolving credit agreement  which was scheduled to expire on december  we entered into a new million secured credit facility which closed january  the facility  which was not drawn at closing  was established for future liquidity  working capital needs and other general corporate purposes 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and can have a maximum availability of up to million over its three and a half year expected term 
we had initial availability of approximately million at closing 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a strategic investment by joining with furukawa to acquire an interest in a portion of the optical fiber and fiber optic cable business of lucent s ofs group 
we acquired an ownership interest  valued at million  in ofs brightwave  which includes transmission fiber and fiber optic cable manufacturing capabilities at a million square foot facility in norcross  georgia  as well as facilities in germany and brazil  an interest in a joint venture in carrollton  georgia and an interest in a joint venture in russia 
the acquisition of our million ownership interest and a million note receivable was financed in a noncash transaction by issuing million shares of commscope  inc common stock valued at million  or per share  to lucent 
as of october   we  together with furukawa  purchased these million shares of our common stock from lucent 
the total purchase price paid to lucent by us and furukawa on october  for the million shares was approximately million  or per share 
of the total million shares of our common stock purchased from lucent  furukawa purchased approximately million shares  which we understand it plans to hold for investment purposes 
we repurchased the remaining approximately million shares  which are currently classified as treasury stock 
we funded our million repurchase using existing cash balances 
as of december   furukawa owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in conjunction with this stock purchase  we also entered into agreements with furukawa which outline various investment terms  including resale restrictions  registration rights  standstill provisions  as well as call and limited put rights related to our shares held by furukawa 
additionally  we agreed with furukawa to change from to the date when we could first exercise our contractual right to sell our investment in ofs brightwave to furukawa for a cash payment equal to our original investment in and advances to ofs brightwave 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  in millions amount of payments due per period contractual obligations total payments less than years years after due year years long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations effects of inflation we continually attempt to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and selling prices 
during the past few years  the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
the principal raw materials purchased by us fabricated aluminum  plastics and polymers  bimetals  copper and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as these materials are linked to the commodity markets 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers  the cost increases could have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
other we are either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business  however  we believe none of these legal matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial statements upon final disposition 
in addition  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials 
our manufacturing facilities are believed to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations 
compliance with current laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a materially adverse effect on our financial statements

fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees and clarifies that at the time a guarantee is issued  a liability must be recognized for the fair value of the obligations assumed under that guarantee and this information must be disclosed in the interim and annual financial statements 
this guidance does not apply to certain guarantee contracts  such as those issued by insurance companies or for a lessee s residual value guarantee embedded in a capital lease 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at the inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations would not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
fin was effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december  and its disclosure requirements were effective for us as of december  there was no material impact on us upon adoption of fin in december  the fasb issued sfas no

to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  sfas no

the provisions related to the alternative transition methods and the new disclosure requirements were effective for us as of december  there was no impact on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 but our disclosures related to stock based compensation have been modified in accordance with the new requirements 
the interim reporting provisions of sfas no 
are effective for us as of march   and we expect to modify our future quarterly disclosures in accordance with the new requirements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which is an interpretation of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin addresses how to identify a variable interest entity  referred to herein as a vie  and provides guidance on when a vie should be consolidated by an enterprise 
if the enterprise is the primary beneficiary  which is defined as the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interest in the entity  then the enterprise must consolidate the vie 
fin also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders of a vie 
the consolidation requirements apply immediately to all vies created after january  public companies must apply the consolidation requirements to vies that existed prior to february  and remain in existence as of the beginning of annual or interim periods beginning after june  if it is reasonably possible that a company will have a significant variable interest in a vie at the date the interpretation s consolidation requirements become effective  the company must make certain disclosures about the vie in financial statements issued after january  the application of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our disclosures and is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
european monetary union euro effective january   member countries of the european monetary union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges 
the legacy currencies of the participating countries remained legal tender for a transition period between january  and january  we conduct business in member countries 
during the transition period  cashless payments for example  wire transfers could be made in the euro  and parties to individual transactions could elect to pay for goods and services using either the euro or the legacy currency 
between january  and february   the participating countries introduced euro notes and coins and will eventually withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
european legislation provides that  unless otherwise agreed  the introduction of the euro will not  by itself  give any party to a contract the right to terminate the contract  or to demand renegotiation of the terms 
as of december   we believe we have adequately addressed the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
among the issues which we faced were the assessment and conversion of information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of legacy currencies 
we have also modified certain existing contracts  if required  and have revised our pricing marketing strategies in the affected european markets to the extent necessary for the introduction of the euro 
in addition  our belgian subsidiary successfully completed the conversion of its financial systems and share capital to the euro 
we do not believe the euro conversion has had or will have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have established a risk management strategy that includes the reasonable use of derivative and non derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments which may be used by us  include commodity pricing contracts  foreign currency exchange contracts  and contracts hedging exposure to interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  nor do we engage in speculation 
materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials  such as fabricated aluminum  plastics and polymers  bimetals  copper and optical fiber  are subject to changes in market price as they are linked to the commodity markets 
management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with our key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
however  increases in the prices of certain commodity products could result in higher overall production costs 
approximately of our sales were to customers located outside the united states  compared to in although we primarily bill customers in foreign countries in us dollars  a portion of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly sales from our foreign subsidiaries 
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due 
in addition  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
the acquisition of our belgian subsidiary created a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the euro compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
prior to its termination  our eurodollar credit agreement served as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
on december   we terminated this hedging relationship and entered into a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange agreement  which we designated as a new hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
our investment in brazil during created a new foreign subsidiary and a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
we continue to evaluate alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk of our net investment in the brazilian subsidiary 
as of december   the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange agreement  which serves as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
the fair value of this net investment hedging instrument as of december  was a loss of million  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was an interest rate swap agreement that served as a fixed rate hedge of the variable rate borrowings under our eurodollar credit agreement  as required under the covenants of this term loan 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  was not material to our financial position 
at december   we were continuing to evaluate hedging alternatives related to foreign currency exposures 
in addition  we evaluated our commodity pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently practical to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price risks 
our non derivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  trade payables  and debt instruments 
at december  and  the carrying values of each of the financial instruments recorded on our balance sheet were considered representative of their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates and or short terms to maturity  with the exception of our convertible debt  which was recorded in the financial statements at million  but had a fair value of million at december  and million at december  fair value of our debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis  based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements  or quoted market prices whenever available 
the following tables summarize our market risks associated with long term debt and foreign currency exposure as of december  and the tables present principal and interest cash outflows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
variable interest rates for each year represent the interest rate effective for the related loan as of december  for the first table and as of december  for the second table 
however  the interest rate on the eurodollar credit agreement is fixed at in the table  since we had designated an interest rate swap agreement as a fixed rate hedge of the variable rate borrowings under this agreement  as required by its terms 
the interest cash outflows for the eurodollar credit agreement  disclosed below  include the effect of the interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converts the variable interest payments to a fixed rate basis 
the table shows the actual prepayment of the eurodollar credit agreement in december the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the euro denominated principal and interest payments into us dollars are based on the actual exchange rates on the dates of the payments in in addition  the foreign currency exchange rate used to disclose the net interest payments under the cross currency swap agreement was based on the usd eur exchange rate as of december  the tables assume payments will be made in accordance with due dates in the respective agreements and no prepayment of any amounts due  with the exception of the prepayment of million under our eurodollar credit agreement in late and million under our revolving credit agreement in early the tabular format used below does not reflect our option to redeem all or a portion of the million convertible notes at any time on or after december  at redemption prices specified in the indenture
