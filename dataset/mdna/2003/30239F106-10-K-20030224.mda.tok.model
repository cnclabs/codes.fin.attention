item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section includes a summary of fbl financial group  inc s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and where appropriate  factors that management believes may affect future performance 
please read this discussion in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
unless noted otherwise  all references to fbl financial group  inc we or the company include all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries  including its primary life insurance subsidiaries  farm bureau life insurance company farm bureau life and equitrust life insurance company equitrust collectively  the life companies 
overview we sell universal life  variable universal life  and traditional life insurance and traditional and variable annuity products 
these products are principally marketed through a core distribution force consisting of approximately  exclusive farm bureau agents in the midwestern and western sections of the united states 
variable universal life and variable annuity products are also marketed in other states through alliances with unaffiliated farm bureau companies 
we also market variable products through alliances with three life insurance companies and a regional broker dealer not affiliated with farm bureau 
in addition to writing direct insurance business  we assume through coinsurance agreements a percentage of certain business written by american equity investment life insurance company american equity and national travelers life company ntl 
these coinsurance agreements utilize excess capital and increase our volume of business in force 
several subsidiaries support various functional areas of the life companies and other affiliates  by providing investment advisory  marketing and distribution  and leasing services 
in addition  we manage ntl and three farm bureau affiliated property casualty insurance companies 
significant accounting policies and estimates the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting polices  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  premiums and considerations received for equity indexed products and interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the life companies receive investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
for equity indexed products  proceeds from call options are earned from a portion of the funds deposited  which are passed through to the contract holders in the form of index credits 
index credits and interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
for variable universal life and variable annuities  premiums received are not reported as revenues 
similar to universal life and traditional annuities  revenues reported consist of fee income and product charges collected from the policyholders 
expenses related to these products include benefit claims incurred in excess of policyholder account balances 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for participating traditional 
table of contents life insurance  equity indexed and interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the life companies revise their estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year based on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the life companies is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
we have the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  as well as the hypothetical effects of changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate balance sheet caption description of critical estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions approach used fixed maturities available for sale 
we estimate the fair values of securities that are not actively traded 
fair values are principally estimated using a matrix calculation assuming a spread over u 
s 
treasury bonds 
the spread is based on current interest rates  risk assessment of the bonds and the current market environment 
we believe that reasonable changes in the interest spread  ranging from basis points to basis points  depending upon credit quality  would produce a total value ranging from million to million  as compared to the recorded amount of million 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are recorded directly in stockholders equity  net of offsets  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
fixed maturities available for sale and equity securities we are required to exercise judgement to determine when a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
we evaluate the operating results of the underlying issuer  near term prospects of the issuer  general market conditions  causes for the decline in value  the length of time there has been a decline in value and other key economic measures 
we also evaluate our ability and intent to hold the security 
at december   we had fixed maturity and equity securities with gross unrealized losses totaling million 
included in the gross unrealized losses are losses attributable to both movement in market interest rates as well as temporary credit issues 
details regarding these securities are included in the financial condition investments section that follows 
net income would be reduced by approximately million if all these securities were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 

table of contents balance sheet caption description of critical estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions approach used deferred policy acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following yield on investments supporting the liabilities  amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies  amount of policy fees and charges  amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  and amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
these estimates  which are revised at least annually  are based on historical results and our best estimate of future experience 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for participating life insurance and interest sensitive products is expected to total million for  excluding the impact of new production in a percent increase in estimated gross profits for would result in million of additional amortization expense 
correspondingly  a percent decrease in estimated gross profits would result in million less amortization expense 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
the development of reserves for future policy benefits for equity indexed products requires the valuation of the embedded derivatives relating to the contract holder s right to participate in one or more market indexes 
this valuation requires assumptions as to future option costs that are dependent upon the volatility of the market indexes  risk free interest rates  market returns and the expected lives of the contracts 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
for equity indexed products  these assumptions are revised at each balance sheet date 
due to the number of independent variables inherent in the calculation of traditional life insurance reserves and reserves for the embedded derivatives in equity indexed annuities  it is not practical to perform a sensitivity analysis on the impact of reasonable changes in the underlying assumptions 
the cost of performing detailed calculations using different assumption scenarios outweighs the benefit that would be derived 
we believe our assumptions are realistic and produce reserves that are fairly stated in accordance with gaap 

table of contents balance sheet caption description of critical estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions approach used other assets liabilities the determination of net periodic pension expense and related accrued prepaid pension cost requires the use of estimates as to the expected return on plan assets  discount rate on plan liabilities and other actuarial assumptions 
pension expense for totaled million 
we have assumed the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be  which is approximately equal to the rate earned historically 
in estimating the discount rate for  we based it on the rate of return currently available on high quality  fixed income investments 
a basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would result in a million increase in pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would result in a million increase in pension expense 
a basis point increase in these rates would result in a decrease to expense at a level generally commensurate with that noted above 
significant transactions impacting the comparability of results during  we entered into a coinsurance agreement with american equity whereby we assumed of certain fixed and equity indexed annuity business written by american equity from august  to december  the agreement also provides for us to assume of certain new business written by american equity during and this agreement was accounted for as the reinsurance of an in force block of business as of october   and the regular coinsurance of the business written thereafter 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of income include revenues and expenses pertaining to this business for and the fourth quarter of reserves transferred to us in connection with the assumption of the in force block of business totaled million 
collected premiums assumed as a result of this agreement totaled million for and million for the fourth quarter of effective may   we entered into a coinsurance agreement with ntl whereby we assumed of ntl s traditional life  universal life and annuity business in force 
in addition  we agreed to assume of ntl s traditional life  universal life and annuity business issued on an ongoing basis 
assets acquired on may  in connection with this transaction totaled million 
collected premiums assumed as a result of this agreement totaled million for compared to million for effective january   we acquired the assets and liabilities of kansas farm bureau life insurance company  inc kansas farm bureau life  a single state life insurance company selling traditional life and annuity products in kansas 
in connection with this acquisition  we assumed all of kansas farm bureau life s insurance business through an assumption reinsurance agreement 
as a result of the acquisition  our geographic market territory expanded into the state of kansas for our traditional products and our exclusive agency force increased by agents 
assets acquired with this transaction totaled million 
premiums collected on business issued in kansas totaled million in and million in consistent with our objective to exit the disability income line of business  effective september   we entered into a coinsurance agreement to reinsure the individual disability income business acquired through the kansas farm bureau life transaction 
as a result  the consolidated statements of income include the operating results from this accident and health business only through august  effective september   we entered into a coinsurance agreement to reinsure the individual disability income business on our books at that time 
as a result  the consolidated statements of income include the operating results from this business only through august  a loss totaling million on these coinsurance transactions has been deferred and is being recognized over the term of the underlying policies 

table of contents results of operations for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share data net income less dividends on series b and c preferred stock net income applicable to common stock earnings per common share earnings per common share assuming dilution net income applicable to common stock increased in to million and decreased in to million 
the increase in net income for is due to an increase in the volume of business in force resulting from the inclusion of a full year of business from american equity and ntl  as well as increases in sales from our core distribution agency force 
results in also benefited from an acceleration of net discount accretion on mortgage and asset backed securities resulting from increasing prepayment speed assumptions 
the decrease in net income in is due primarily to a decrease in equity income and a reduction of net investment income resulting from stock repurchase activity during the impact of these items were partially offset by net income generated from the kansas farm bureau life  ntl and american equity transactions  an increase in fee income from mortgage loan prepayments and bond calls and a reduction in realized losses on investments 
the change in earnings per common share from year to year is impacted by changes in the weighted average common shares outstanding 
weighted average common shares outstanding  assuming dilution  increased to  in and decreased to  in from  in the decrease in is the result of acquisitions of common stock by the company primarily during a summary of our premiums and product charges is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands premiums and product charges interest sensitive product charges traditional life insurance premiums accident and health premiums total premiums and product charges increased in to million and in to million 
the increase in is due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of american equity and ntl activity 
revenues from the american equity and ntl business included interest sensitive product charges totaling million in and million in and traditional life insurance premiums totaling million in and million in in addition  the cost of insurance charges  which are included in interest sensitive product charges  increased as a result of an increase in the volume and age of business in force 
the increase in premiums and product charges is due primarily to the addition of the kansas farm bureau life  ntl and american equity business 
revenues from the kansas farm bureau life business in included interest sensitive product charges of million  traditional life insurance premiums of million and accident and health premiums of million 
accident and health premiums decreased as a result of coinsurance agreements to reinsure our individual long term disability income business effective september  and net investment income  which excludes investment income on separate account assets relating to variable products  increased in to million and increased in to million 
these increases are due to an increase in average invested assets of to  million based on securities at amortized cost compared to  million in and  million in the increase in average invested assets in and is due to cash and investments received pursuant to the american equity and ntl coinsurance agreements and net premium inflows from our core distribution agency force 
average invested assets also increased in due to the acquisition of approximately million in investments from the kansas farm bureau life transaction 
the annualized yield earned on average invested assets was in and in and 
table of contents changing market conditions in  and decreased our investment portfolio yield as investment rates were  in general  lower than our portfolio yield or yield on investments maturing or being paid down 
however  in an increase in prepayment fees and bond call income offset the impact of these market conditions 
fee income from mortgage loan prepayments and bond calls totaled million in  million in and million in net investment income includes million in  million in and million in representing an acceleration of net discount accretion on mortgage and asset backed securities resulting from increasing prepayment speed assumptions during the respective periods 
see financial condition investments section that follows for a description of how changes in prepayment speeds impact net investment income 
derivative income loss totaled million in compared to million in our derivative income loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on the value of call options used to fund returns on our equity indexed annuity contracts assumed from american equity and on the value of the conversion feature embedded in convertible fixed maturity securities 
in addition  derivative income loss includes proceeds from the exercise of the call options 
the increase in derivative loss is due to the increase in equity indexed business assumed from american equity and a decline in the value of the related call options resulting from the passage of time and a general decline in the equity markets during changes in the value of the call options are partially offset by corresponding changes in the value of the embedded derivatives in the underlying equity indexed contracts 
changes in the value of these embedded derivatives are recorded as a component of interest sensitive product benefits 
derivative income loss will fluctuate based on market conditions and could result in income or loss 
realized losses on investments decreased in to million and decreased in to million 
realized losses include writedowns of investments that became other than temporarily impaired totaling million in  million in and million in these writedowns are the result of the issuers of the securities having deteriorating operating trends  alleged corporate fraud  decreases in debt ratings  defaults on loan payments  unsuccessful efforts to raise capital and various other operational or economic factors that became evident in the respective years 
approximately million of the realized losses in were from securities issued by or affiliated with worldcom inc  including million of losses assumed from an investment in worldcom  inc bonds made by a variable alliance partner 
our losses also include approximately million from securities issued by united air lines 
approximately million of the realized losses in were from four securities issued by or affiliated with enron corporation 
approximately million of the realized losses in were from eight securities that were investment grade when acquired 
the level of realized gains losses is subject to fluctuation from year to year depending on the prevailing interest rate and economic environment and the timing of the sale of investments 
other income and other expenses include revenues and expenses  respectively  relating primarily to our non insurance operations 
these operations include management  advisory  marketing and distribution services and leasing activities 
fluctuations in these financial statement line items are generally attributable to fluctuations in the level of these services provided during the periods 
a summary of our policy benefits is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands policy benefits interest sensitive products benefits traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits increase in traditional life and accident and health future policy benefits distributions to participating policyholders total policy benefits increased in to million and in to million 
the increase in is due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of american equity and ntl business and an increase in our direct business in force 
benefits incurred from the american equity and ntl business include interest sensitive product benefits of million in and million in  traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits  including change in reserves  of million in and million in and distributions to participating policyholders of million in and million in partially offsetting the increase in 
table of contents was the impact of reductions in dividend and interest crediting rates on many of our products made in response to a declining investment portfolio yield 
interest crediting rates were decreased at various dates throughout the year to on our primary fixed annuity product and on our primary universal life insurance product 
the dividend rate on our participating life policies was also reduced effective october  the increase in policy benefits during was also offset by a million reduction in reserves relating to the discontinuation of certain group life business 
changes in the value of the embedded derivatives included in the equity indexed annuity contracts resulted in an increase in the reserve for interest sensitive products totaling million for and million for the increase in policy benefits in is due primarily to the addition of the kansas farm bureau life  ntl and american equity business 
benefits incurred from the kansas farm bureau life business in included interest sensitive product benefits of million  traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits  including change in reserves  of million and distributions to participating policyholders of million 
traditional life benefits also increased in due to increased death benefits on our direct business and our participation in a reinsurance pool for catastrophic events 
we incurred million of death benefits in for losses from this pool resulting from the terrorist attacks on september  partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in accident and health benefits as a result of the coinsurance of our long term disability income business during and policy benefits can tend to fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in mortality and morbidity experience 
a summary of our underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses commission expense  net of deferrals amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs amortization of value of insurance in force acquired other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses  net of deferrals total underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased in to million and in to million 
the increase in is due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of american equity and ntl business  while the increase in is due primarily to the addition of kansas farm bureau life  ntl and american equity business 
expenses from ntl and american equity business include commission and expense allowances totaling million for compared to million for and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs totaling million for compared to million for underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses relating to the kansas farm bureau life business totaled million in the increases in are offset by i a million decrease in amortization of value of insurance in force acquired resulting principally from the impact of realized losses on investments backing the related policyholder liabilities  ii a reduction in other underwriting expense due to the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill and iii a reduction in expenses as a result of the coinsurance of our long term disability income business during the increase in expenses was partially offset by a million recovery of excess royalty fees paid in prior years for our agreement with the iowa farm bureau federation to use the farm bureau and fb designations in the state of iowa 
the increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in is due partly to a shift in product profitability to blocks of business that have a larger acquisition cost remaining to be amortized or that have higher amortization factors 
in addition  amortization increased due to an increase in the unamortized acquisition cost asset caused by the growth in the volume of business in force 
other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses includes goodwill amortization totaling million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for goodwill amortization beginning in pension expense  which is included in other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses  is expected to increase to approximately million in from million in this increase is due to several factors including salary increases  the impact of actual investment experience of plan assets and other experience being different than expected and a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities 
interest expense decreased in to million and decreased in to million 
the decreases in and are due to a decrease in the interest rate on our million variable rate debt 
in addition  for there was as a decrease in average debt outstanding 

table of contents income taxes increased in to million and in to million 
the effective tax rate was for  for and for the effective tax rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the tax benefit associated with the payment of dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trust  tax exempt interest and tax exempt dividend income in  and the decrease in the effective tax rate in compared to is due primarily to a change in the estimate of certain deferred tax liabilities 
equity income  net of related income taxes  decreased in to million and decreased in to million 
equity income includes our proportionate share of gains and losses attributable to our ownership interest in partnerships  joint ventures and certain companies where we exhibit some control but have a minority ownership interest 
given the timing of when financial information from these entities is available  we will consistently use information that is as much as three months in arrears for certain of these entities 
several of these entities are venture capital investment companies  whose operating results are derived primarily from unrealized and realized gains and losses generated by their investment portfolios 
the income in is primarily unrealized appreciation on two internet related equity securities owned by two of these venture capital investment companies 
a substantial portion of the positions held by the equity investees in these two entities was distributed to us and subsequently sold during as is normal with these types of entities  the level of these gains and losses is subject to fluctuation from period to period depending on the prevailing economic environment  changes in prices of equity securities held by the investment partnerships  timing and success of initial public offerings and other exit strategies  and the timing of the sale of investments held by the partnerships and joint ventures 
as a result of our common stock investment in american equity investment life holding company  equity income includes million in and and million in  representing our share of its net income 
in addition  equity income is net of goodwill amortization totaling million in and see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for goodwill amortization beginning in also  see the other assets section following for additional information regarding the composition of our equity investees 
dividends on series b and c preferred stock totaled million in  million in and million in the increase for is due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the series c preferred stock 
the increase for is due to the issuance of the series c preferred stock in connection with our acquisition of kansas farm bureau life on january  discontinued operations we recorded a gain of million in  net of related income taxes  on the sale of utah farm bureau insurance company utah insurance  a former wholly owned property casualty insurance company  to farm bureau mutual insurance company farm bureau mutual  an affiliate 
we did not record any gain during or as the loss ratio of the related utah business was higher than the threshold loss ratio in the earn out calculation included in the sales agreement 
the earn out period under the sales agreement ended december  segment information management analyzes financial information regarding products that are aggregated into three product segments 
these segments are traditional annuity  traditional and universal life insurance and variable 
we also have various support operations and corporate capital that is aggregated into a corporate and other segment 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding segment information 

table of contents we analyze our segment results based on pre tax operating income 
accordingly  income taxes are not allocated to the segments 
in addition  operating results are analyzed net of any transactions between the segments 
operating income represents net income excluding the impact of realized gains and losses on investments  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and discontinued operations 
the impact of realized gains and losses on investments includes adjustments for income taxes and that portion of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  unearned revenue reserve and value of insurance in force acquired attributable to such gains or losses 
a reconciliation of net income to pre tax operating income follows 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net income realized losses on investments change in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs value of insurance in force acquired unearned revenue reserve income tax offset realized losses  net of offsets income taxes on operating income cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivative instruments gain on disposal of property casualty operations net of related income taxes pre tax operating income a discussion of our operating results  by segment  follows 
traditional annuity segment year ended december  pre tax operating income dollars in thousands operating revenues interest sensitive product charges net investment income derivative income loss benefits and expenses pre tax operating income other data annuity premiums collected  net of reinsurance policy liabilities and accruals  end of year pre tax operating income for the traditional annuity segment increased in to million and in to million 
pre tax operating income and the volume of revenues  benefits and expenses increased in primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of ntl and american equity business and increases in sales from our core distribution agency force 
also contributing to the increase in pre tax operating income in was the acceleration of net discount accretion on mortgage and asset backed securities as noted in the investment income discussion above 
the increase in is due to the addition of kansas farm bureau life  ntl and american equity business and an increase in bond call and prepayment fee income 
annuity premiums collected from american equity and ntl business totaled million in and million in direct annuity premiums collected increased in to million 
annuity premiums received as a result of the kansas farm bureau life acquisition totaled million in as noted in the policy benefits discussion above  we decreased crediting rates by a total of basis points on our primary annuity contract on various dates in 
table of contents in response to a decline in our investment portfolio yield 
the crediting rate on our flexible premium deferred annuity was also reduced basis points during as a result of the general decline in market interest rates during traditional and universal life insurance segment year ended december  pre tax operating income dollars in thousands operating revenues interest sensitive product charges traditional life insurance premiums and other income net investment income derivative loss benefits and expenses pre tax operating income other data life premiums collected  net of reinsurance policy liabilities and accruals  end of year pre tax operating income for the traditional and universal life insurance segment increased in to million and in to million 
revenues  benefits  expenses and pre tax operating income for increased due principally to the inclusion of a full year of ntl business and increases in the volume of business from our core distribution agency force 
the increase in pre tax income and the volume of business in force in is due primarily to the addition of the kansas farm bureau life and ntl business 
life insurance premiums collected from the ntl business totaled million in and million in life insurance premiums received as a result of the kansas farm bureau life acquisition totaled million in as noted in the discussion of policy benefits above  pre tax operating income in benefited from a million reserve reduction relating to the discontinuation of certain group life business 
total benefits and expenses were also impacted by decreases in interest and dividend crediting rates  including decreases of basis points in and basis points in on our primary universal life insurance product 
benefits for include million in losses resulting from the terrorist attacks on september  also  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased by million in and increased million in due to changes in the assumptions used to calculate deferred policy acquisition costs 
on a consolidated basis the impact of these assumption changes was largely offset by the impact of assumption changes made in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in the variable segment 
variable segment year ended december  pre tax operating income dollars in thousands operating revenues interest sensitive product charges net investment income other income benefits and expenses pre tax operating income loss other data variable premiums collected  net of reinsurance and internal rollovers policy liabilities and accruals  end of year separate account assets  end of year pre tax operating income loss for the variable segment totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the pre tax operating loss is primarily attributable to increases in death 
table of contents benefits and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
death benefits in excess of related account values on variable universal life policies increased to million in and increased to million in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased million in and decreased million in due to changes in the assumptions used to calculate deferred policy acquisition costs 
as noted above  on a consolidated basis the impact of these assumption changes was largely offset by the impact of assumption changes made in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in the traditional and universal life insurance segment 
expenses were reduced by million in as a result of the recovery of certain royalty fees as discussed above 
operating revenues increased in compared to in  due to growth in the volume of business in force 
the variable segment does not currently contribute significantly to our bottom line due to fee income structure on these products and the significant administrative costs associated with the sale and processing of this business 
profitability of this line of business is expected to increase as the volume of business grows and the significant fixed costs of administering the business are spread over a larger block of policies 
corporate and other segment year ended december  pre tax operating income dollars in thousands operating revenues accident and health insurance premiums net investment income derivative income loss other income benefits and expenses minority interest equity income  before tax pre tax operating income loss pre tax operating income loss for the corporate and other segment totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the fluctuations in pre tax operating income are primarily due to the fluctuations in equity income as described above 
the decrease in net investment income in is due to a decrease in average invested assets resulting from a smaller volume of accident and health business in force and a million stock repurchase and tender offer during the fourth quarter of as noted above  we sold our long term disability income business through two coinsurance agreements in and these agreements decreased the level of operations reflected in the corporate and other segment 
financial condition investments our total investment portfolio increased to  million at december  compared to  million at december  this increase is primarily the result of net cash received from interest sensitive and equity indexed products and positive cash flow provided by operating activities 
internal investment professionals manage our investment portfolio 
the investment strategy is designed to achieve superior risk adjusted returns consistent with the investment philosophy of maintaining a largely investment grade portfolio and providing adequate liquidity for obligations to policyholders and other requirements 
we continually review the returns on invested assets and change the mix of invested assets as deemed prudent under the current market environment to help maximize current income

non investment grade debt securities generally provide higher yields and involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities because their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than investment grade issuers 
in addition  the trading market for these securities is usually more limited than for investment grade debt securities 
we regularly review the percentage of our portfolio that is invested in non investment grade debt securities naic designations through 
as of december   the investment in non investment grade debt was of fixed maturity securities 
at that time no single non investment grade holding exceeded of total investments

unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in market interest rates or changes in credit spreads since the securities were acquired 
any such unrealized losses are recognized in income if  and when  we decide to sell the securities 
as of december   million  or  of the gross unrealized losses on our fixed maturity securities are rated below investment grade 
we believe the issuers of these securities will continue to make payments as scheduled  and we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until they recover in value or mature 
the scheduled maturity dates for securities in an unrealized loss position at december  is as follows 
carrying value of securities with gross unrealized losses gross unrealized losses dollars in thousands due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years mortgage and asset backed securities redeemable preferred stock total at december   no securities from the same issuer had an aggregate unrealized loss in excess of million 

table of contents mortgage and other asset backed securities constitute a significant portion of our portfolio of securities 
these securities are purchased when we believe these types of investments provide superior risk adjusted returns compared to returns of more conventional investments such as corporate bonds and mortgage loans 
these securities are diversified as to collateral types  cash flow characteristics and maturity 
the return of principal on mortgage and other asset backed securities occurs more frequently and is more variable than that of more traditional fixed maturity securities 
the principal prepayment speeds eg  the rate of individuals refinancing their home mortgages can vary based on a number of economic factors that can not be predicted with certainty 
these factors include the prevailing interest rate environment and general status of the economy 
deviations in actual prepayment speeds from that originally expected can cause a change in the yield earned on mortgage and asset backed securities purchased at a premium or discount 
increases in prepayment speeds  which typically occur in a decreasing interest rate environment  generally increase the rate at which discount is accrued and premium is amortized into income 
decreases in prepayment speeds  which typically occur in an increasing interest rate environment  generally slow down the rate these amounts are recorded into income 
the mortgage backed portfolio includes pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation cmo securities 
with a pass through security  we receive a pro rata share of principal payments as payments are made on the underlying mortgage loans 
cmos consist of pools of mortgages divided into sections or tranches which provide sequential retirement of the bonds 
we invest in sequential tranches  which provide cash flow stability in that principal payments do not occur until the previous tranches are paid off 
in addition  to provide call protection and more stable average lives  we invest in cmos such as planned amortization class pac and targeted amortization class tac securities 
cmos of these types provide more predictable cash flows within a range of prepayment speeds by shifting the prepayment risks to support tranches 
we do not purchase certain types of collateralized mortgage obligations that we believe would subject the investment portfolio to greater than average risk 
these include  but are not limited to  interest only  principal only  floater  inverse floater  pac ii  z and support tranches 
however  in connection with the kansas farm bureau life acquisition  we did acquire z securities with a carrying value of million at december  these securities generally tend to have more duration risk risk the security s price will change significantly with a given change in market interest rates than the other types of mortgage backed securities in our portfolio

amortized cost par value carrying value percent of fixed maturities dollars in thousands residential mortgage backed securities sequential pass through planned and targeted amortization class other total residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities other asset backed securities total mortgage and asset backed securities the commercial and other asset backed securities are primarily sequential securities 
commercial mortgage backed securities typically have cash flows that are less sensitive to interest rate changes than residential securities of similar types due principally to prepayment restrictions on many of the underlying commercial mortgage loans 
other asset backed securities are principally mortgage related manufactured housing and home equity loans which historically have also demonstrated relatively less cash flow volatility than residential securities of similar types 
at december   we held million or of invested assets in equity securities 
at december   gross unrealized gains totaled million and gross unrealized losses totaled million on these securities 
at december   we held million or of invested assets in mortgage loans 
these mortgage loans are diversified as to property type  location and loan size  and are collateralized by the related properties 
at december   mortgages more than days delinquent accounted for less than of the carrying value of the mortgage portfolio 
our mortgage lending policies establish limits on the amount that can be loaned to one borrower and require diversification by geographic location and collateral type 
regions with the largest 
table of contents concentration of our mortgage loan portfolio at december  include pacific  which includes california  and west south central  which includes oklahoma and texas 
mortgage loans on real estate are also diversified by collateral type with office buildings  retail facilities and industrial facilities representing the largest holdings at december  other assets deferred policy acquisition costs increased to million at december  due to the capitalization of costs incurred with new sales  principally from the american equity coinsurance agreement 
assets held in separate accounts decreased to million at december  due primarily to fluctuations in market value  partially offset by the transfer of net premiums to the separate accounts 
at december   we had total assets of  million  a increase from total assets at december  the securities and indebtedness of related parties line on the balance sheet  which includes the investments that generate our equity income  is comprised of the following december  dollars in thousands american equity investment life holding company  common and preferred stock berthel fisher and company and affiliates venture capital investment partnerships in and real estate investment partnerships in and in mortgage loans and other proportionate share of net unrealized investment losses of equity investees securities and indebtedness of related parties securities and indebtedness of related parties decreased to million due principally to a decrease in real estate held as securities and indebtedness of related parties and an increase in our share of unrealized investment losses on investments primarily fixed maturity securities owned by american equity investment life holding company 
since we record american equity investment life holding company s results one quarter in arrears  this reflects the valuation of its investments as of september  and liabilities and redeemable preferred stock policy liabilities and accruals and other policyholders funds increased to  million at december  primarily due to the addition of the american equity business and growth in the volume of business in force from our core distribution system 
we reclassified our million debt from long term to short term as the debt is due september  deferred income taxes increased to million at december  due primarily to an increase in deferred taxes on the change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on fixed maturity securities 
other liabilities decreased to million at december  due primarily to a decrease in payables for security purchases 
at december   we had total liabilities of  million  a increase from total liabilities at december  our variable annuity contracts contain a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb rider 
for a majority of our contracts  the gmdb provides for a return of the contract holder s premiums deposited into the contract  net of partial withdrawals  upon the contract holder s death 
our exposure to the gmdbs gmdb exceeds account value  net of reinsurance ceded  totaled million at december  and million at december  reserves for this benefit  which take into account the probability of death before the account value increases to an amount equal to or greater than the gmdb  totaled million at december  and million at december series c redeemable preferred stock increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase represents the accretion of the discount on these securities 
the series c redeemable preferred stock was issued at an million discount 
the mandatory redemption is structured so that 
table of contents of the series c preferred stock will be redeemed at par value  or million  on january  with the remaining redeemed at par value  or million  on january  stockholders equity stockholders equity increased  to million at december   compared to million at december  this increase is principally attributable to net income for the year and the change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on fixed maturity and equity securities  partially offset by dividends paid 
at december   common stockholders equity was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share at december  included in stockholders equity per common share is at december  and at december  attributable to net unrealized investment gains resulting from marking our fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale to market value 
the change in unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity and equity securities increased stockholders equity million during  after related adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs  value of insurance in force acquired  unearned revenue reserve and deferred income taxes 
the change in unrealized appreciation is primarily the result of a decrease in market interest rates as of december  compared to december  market risks of financial instruments interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure 
substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of insurance products and market value of investments 
the yield realized on new investments generally increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
the market value of our fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolios generally increases when interest rates decrease  and decreases when interest rates increase 
a majority of our insurance liabilities are backed by fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 
the fixed maturity securities have laddered maturities and a weighted average life of years at december  and years at december  accordingly  the earned rate on the portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
the extent that the portfolio yield lags behind changes in market yields generally depends upon the following factors the average life of the portfolio 
the amount and speed at which market interest rates rise or fall 
the amount by which bond calls  mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage and asset backed securities accelerate during periods of declining interest rates 
the amount by which bond calls  mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage and asset backed securities decelerate during periods of increasing interest rates 
for a majority of our traditional insurance products  profitability is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
for variable and equity indexed products  profitability on the portion of the policyholder s account balance invested in the fixed general account option  if any  is also affected by the spreads earned 
for the variable products  the policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts 
for a substantial portion of our direct business in force  we have the ability to adjust interest or dividend crediting rates in reaction to changes in portfolio yield 
we had the ability to adjust rates on of our liabilities at december  and at december  however  the ability to adjust these rates is limited by competitive factors 
surrender rates could increase and new sales could be negatively impacted if the crediting rates are not competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other insurance companies and financial services institutions 
in addition  if market rates were to decrease substantially and stay at a low level for an extended period of time  our spread could be lowered due to interest rate guarantees on many of our interest sensitive products 
at december  and  interest rate guarantees on our direct interest sensitive products ranged from to 
the weighted average guarantee was at december  and at december  at december   direct annuities and universal life products with an aggregate account value of million were receiving interest credited at the guaranteed rate and direct annuities and universal life products with an aggregate account value of million were receiving interest credited at a rate within basis points of the applicable guaranteed rate 

table of contents for a substantial portion of business assumed from ntl and american equity  ntl and american equity  respectively  have the ability to adjust interest and dividend crediting rates in reaction to portfolio yield 
while we are precluded from directly controlling these rates  we do manage certain aspects of ntl through a management agreement and have a representative on american equity s board of directors 
most of the traditional annuity and universal life insurance contracts assumed from american equity and ntl have guaranteed minimum crediting rates 
for contracts assumed from american equity  these rates range from to  with a weighted average crediting rate of at december  for contracts assumed from ntl  these rates range from to with a weighted average crediting rate of at december  at december   none of the contracts assumed from american equity or ntl were receiving interest credited at a rate within basis points of the applicable guaranteed rate 
for the equity indexed products  we purchase  indirectly through american equity  call options that are designed to match the return owed to contract holders who elect to participate in one or more market indexes 
in  proceeds from the maturity of call options totaled million while related index amounts credited to contract holders account balances totaled million 
profitability on the portion of the equity indexed products tied to market indexes is significantly impacted by the spread on interest earned on investments and the sum of cost of underlying call options purchased to match the returns owed to contract holders and minimum interest guarantees owed to the contract holder  if any 
american equity manages the cost of the call options through the terms of the equity indexed annuities  which permit adjustments to annual participation rates  asset fees  and or caps  subject to guaranteed minimums 
the minimum guaranteed contract values are equal to to of the premium collected plus interest credited at a cumulative annual rate of 
profitability on the equity indexed annuities in any given year is also impacted by changes in the fair value of the embedded option which provides the contract holder the right to participate in market index returns after the next anniversary date of the contract 
this impacts profitability because we only purchase one year call options  through american equity  to fund the returns owed to the contract holders at the inception of each contract year 
this practice matches well with the contract holders rights to switch to different indexes on each anniversary date 
the value of the forward starting options embedded in the equity indexed annuities can fluctuate with changes in assumptions as to future volatility of the market indexes  risk free interest rates  market returns and the lives of the contracts 
we design our products and manage our investment portfolio in a manner to encourage persistency and to help ensure targeted spreads are earned 
in addition to the ability to change interest crediting rates on our direct products  certain interest sensitive contracts have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions 
the following is a summary of the surrender and discretionary withdrawal characteristics of our interest sensitive products and supplementary contracts without life contingencies reserve balance at december  dollars in thousands direct business surrender charge rate greater than or equal to less than  but still subject to surrender charge not subject to surrender charge not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal business assumed from ntl and american equity surrender charge rate greater than or equal to less than  but still subject to surrender charge not subject to surrender charge not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal total a major component of our asset liability management program is structuring the investment portfolio with cash flow characteristics consistent with the cash flow characteristics of our insurance liabilities 
we use computer models to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from existing insurance policies under various interest rate scenarios 
information from these models is used in the determination of interest crediting rates and investment strategies 
effective duration is a common measure for price sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it measures the 
table of contents approximate percentage change in the market value of a portfolio when interest rates change by basis points 
this measure includes the impact of estimated changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as bond calls and prepayments 
when the estimated durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is reduced because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
the effective duration of our fixed maturity portfolio was approximately at december  and at december  the effective duration of the interest sensitive products was approximately at december  and at december  if interest rates were to increase from levels at december  and  our fixed maturity securities and short term investments would decrease approximately million at december  and million at december  this hypothetical change in value does not take into account any offsetting change in the value of insurance liabilities for investment contracts since we estimate such value to be the cash surrender value of the underlying contracts 
if interest rates were to decrease from levels at december  and  the fair value of our debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trust would increase million at december  and million at december  the computer models used to estimate the impact of a change in market interest rates use many assumptions and estimates that materially impact the fair value calculations 
key assumptions used by the models include an immediate and parallel shift in the yield curve and an acceleration of bond calls and principal prepayments on mortgage and other asset backed securities 
the above estimates do not attempt to measure the financial statement impact on the resulting change in deferred policy acquisition costs  value of insurance in force acquired  unearned revenue reserves and income taxes 
due to the subjectivity of these assumptions  the actual impact of a change in rates on the fair market values would likely be different from that estimated 
equity price risk is not material to us due to the relatively small equity portfolio held at december  however  we do earn investment management fees on those investments managed by us and mortality and expense fee income based on the value of our separate accounts 
on an annualized basis  the investment management fee rates range from to for  and the mortality and expense fee rates range from to for  and as a result  revenues from these sources do fluctuate with changes in the market value of the equity  fixed maturity and other securities held by the separate accounts 
in addition  we have equity price risk to the extent we may owe amounts under the guaranteed minimum death benefit provisions of our variable annuity contracts

cash outflows are principally for salaries and other expenses related to providing these management services  dividends on outstanding stock and interest on our holding company debt issued to a subsidiary 
in addition  our parent company will on occasion enter into capital transactions such as the acquisition of our common stock 
we acquired class a common shares totaling  in and  in as a result of stock repurchases 
these transactions reduced stockholders equity by million in and million in we paid cash dividends on our common and preferred stock totaling million in  million in and million in interest payments on the parent company s subordinated deferrable interest notes the notes  relating to the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trust  totaled million in  and it is anticipated that cash dividend requirements for will be per quarter per common and series c preferred share and per quarter per series b preferred share  or approximately million 
in addition  interest payments on the notes are estimated to be million for we have agreed that we will not declare or pay dividends on any class or series of stock except for regular cash dividends defined as regular  fixed  quarterly or other periodic cash dividends as declared by our board of directors as part of the stated cash dividend policy and do not include any other dividends or distributions  such as

fbl financial group  inc expects to rely on available cash resources and on dividends from farm bureau life to make any dividend payments to its stockholders and interest payments on its notes 
in addition  it is anticipated that a combination of available cash resources  additional borrowings and dividends from farm bureau life will be used to fund the scheduled redemption of the series c preferred stock in million and million 
the ability of farm bureau life to pay dividends to fbl financial group  inc is limited by law to earned profits statutory unassigned surplus as of the date the dividend is paid  as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities of the state of iowa 
in addition  under the iowa insurance holding company act  farm bureau life may not pay an extraordinary dividend without prior notice to and approval by the iowa insurance commissioner 
an extraordinary dividend is defined under the iowa insurance holding company act as any dividend or distribution of cash or other property whose fair market value  together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of i of policyholders surplus total statutory capital stock and statutory surplus as of december of the preceding year  or ii the statutory net gain from operations of the insurer for the month period ending december of the preceding year

it is anticipated that funding for any such acquisition would be provided from available cash resources  debt or equity financing 
as of december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the parent company had available cash and investments totaling million at december  insurance operations the life companies cash inflows consist primarily of premium income  deposits to policyholder account balances  product charges on variable products  income from investments  sales  maturities and calls of investments and repayments of investment principal 
the life companies cash outflows are primarily related to withdrawals of policyholder account balances  investment purchases  payment of policy acquisition costs  policyholder benefits  income taxes  dividends and current operating expenses 
life insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow which may be measured by the degree to which cash inflows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyholders and normal operating expenses as they are incurred 
the remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing new business 
the life companies liquidity positions continued to be favorable in  with cash inflows at levels sufficient to provide the funds necessary to meet their obligations 
for the life insurance operations  cash outflow requirements for operations are typically met from normal premium and deposit cash inflows 
net cash inflows outflows for the life companies continuing operations and financing activities relating to interest sensitive products provided funds totaling  million in  million in and million in the significant increases in net cash flows in and are due principally to the impact of the american equity  kansas farm bureau life and ntl transactions 
net cash inflows are primarily used to increase the insurance companies fixed maturity and short term investment portfolios 
the net cash outflow for is primarily the result of a million net payment for reserves pursuant to the individual disability income coinsurance arrangement and increased surrender benefits on interest sensitive products and rollovers from traditional products to variable products 
this cash outflow was funded with available cash and cash provided from investing activities 
in developing their investment strategy  the life companies establish a level of cash and securities which  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments and principal payments on mortgage and asset backed securities and mortgage loans  are believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations 
through membership in the federal home loan bank of des moines fhlb  the life companies are eligible to establish and borrow on a line of credit to provide additional liquidity 
the line of credit available is based on the amount of capital stock of the fhlb owned by the life companies  which supported a borrowing capacity of million as of december  at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under this arrangement  leaving a borrowing capacity of million 
additional collateral would need to be deposited with the fhlb in order to access this additional borrowing capacity 
the outstanding debt is due september   and interest on the debt is charged at a variable rate equal to the london interbank offered rate less

it is management s intention to refinance this note when it matures 
in the normal course of business  we enter into financing transactions  lease agreements  or other commitments which are necessary or beneficial to our operations

although our current intention is to renew these leases  we are not obligated to do so 
we anticipate that funds to meet our short term and long term capital expenditures  cash dividends to stockholders and operating cash needs will come from existing capital and internally generated funds 
we believe that the current level of cash and available for sale and short term securities  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments  principal payments on mortgage and asset backed securities  mortgage loans and our insurance products  are adequate to meet our anticipated cash obligations for the foreseeable future 
our investment portfolio at december   included million of short term investments and million in carrying value of us government and us government agency backed securities that could be readily converted to cash at or near carrying value

accounting changes effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these statements  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
in addition  statement no 
requires the identification and amortization of certain intangible assets that had previously been included as a component of goodwill 
we have performed impairment testing and determined none of our goodwill was impaired as of december  in addition  we have no intangible assets included as a component of goodwill that require separate accounting 
on a pro forma basis without goodwill amortization  net income applicable to common stock for would have been million per share basic and assuming dilution and for would have been million per share basic and assuming dilution 
during  we announced that effective january  we will expense the cost of stock options in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under statement no 
 compensation expense is recognized as stock options vest in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
statement no 
amends statement no 
by requiring more prominent and frequent disclosures regarding the effects of stock based compensation and provides for different transition methods in the adoption of statement no 
historically we have applied accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to stock option grants  which generally has resulted in no compensation expense being recognized 
we anticipate using the prospective method in the adoption of statement no 
under the prospective method  expense will be recognized for those options granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption 
assuming our historical level of stock option issuance and similar option terms  we estimate that expensing stock options in will reduce net income by approximately million per common share 
the impact of adoption will increase over the 
table of contents five year vesting period of the underlying options as options issued before the date of adopting statement no 
will continue to be accounted for under apb no 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the recognition provisions of this interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not anticipate that we will enter into any guarantees that would require recognition as a liability  and accordingly  do not expect the impact of this interpretation to be material to our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
interpretation no 
establishes a variable interests model to follow when determining whether or not to consolidate an entity that is not evaluated for consolidation under the traditional voting interests model 
this interpretation generally requires that a company investee being evaluated under the variable interests model must be consolidated if a the investor has decision making powers over the entity that is  the ability to buy and sell assets or conduct operations or b the investor is exposed to the majority of the risks or rewards of the entity 
in addition  the interpretation requires that investments made by related parties be analyzed together in applying the variable interests model 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation are effective for financial statements issued after january  the consolidation provisions are effective for new transactions entered into after january  and for pre existing entities as of july  we have one investment in a storage facility  jointly owned with an affiliate  which will be consolidated under this interpretation 
at december   this company  which is currently being accounted for using the equity method  had total assets and total liabilities of less than million 
effective january   we adopted statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
statement no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives is dependent on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
without hedge accounting  these gains or losses are recorded as a component of net income 
statement no 
also allowed companies to transfer securities classified as held for investment to either available for sale or trading categories in connection with the adoption of the new standard 
statement no 
amends statement no 
to clarify the appropriate accounting for certain hedging transactions 
we have the following three different forms of derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets which are subject to statement no 
the feature of a convertible fixed maturity security that allows the conversion of a fixed maturity security into an equity security is considered an embedded derivative  the rights of an equity indexed annuity contract holder to participate in the index returns available under the contract are considered embedded derivatives  and our reinsurance recoverable as it relates to call options purchased to fund returns to equity indexed annuity contract holders is considered an embedded derivative 
these derivatives are described more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under the captions investments fixed maturities and equity securities  reinsurance recoverable and future policy benefits 
the cumulative effect of adopting these statements on net income was million in this amount represents the difference in accumulated net unrealized capital gains losses on the date of adoption  net of tax  resulting from the change in accounting for the conversion features embedded in our convertible fixed maturity securities 
income before cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivative instruments for was approximately million less than what would have been recorded without the accounting change due to a decrease in the fair value of these conversion features during the period 
the impact of the accounting change on income relating to the equity indexed annuity derivatives was not quantified  but is not believed to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
upon the adoption of statement no 
 we transferred our fixed maturity securities classified as held for investment  formerly recorded at amortized cost  to the available for sale category 
in connection with this transfer  
table of contents the securities were marked to market and the corresponding increase in carrying value totaling million  net of offsetting adjustments to deferred acquisition costs  value of insurance in force acquired  unearned revenue reserve and income taxes  was credited to stockholders equity 
prior year financial statements were not restated 
in addition to the embedded derivatives noted above  we have modified coinsurance arrangements on certain variable annuity and variable life insurance business under which the ceding company withholds funds 
these assets support the portion of the contract holder s funds allocated to the variable contract s declared interest option 
the investment return earned by the assuming company is based on a referenced pool of fixed maturity securities held by the ceding company 
currently  there are varying interpretations as to whether or not these funds withheld arrangements give rise to an embedded derivative to be accounted for separate from the debt host 
for accounting purposes  we do not treat these funds withheld arrangements as containing an embedded derivative 
it is anticipated that the fasb will provide guidance on this issue during if it is determined that our modified coinsurance agreements contain an embedded derivative  we will be required to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date and changes in the fair values of the derivatives will be recorded as income or expense 
at december   funds withheld on variable business assumed by us totaled million and funds withheld on variable business ceded by us totaled million 
we have not quantified the impact on our financial statements if we accounted for our modified coinsurance contracts as having an embedded derivative 
however  the impact is not expected to be material due to the relatively small balances of funds withheld 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information from time to time  we may publish statements relating to anticipated financial performance  business prospects  new products  and similar matters 
these statements and others that include words such as expect  anticipate  believe  intend  and other similar expressions  constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for these types of statements as long as the information is identified as forward looking and is accompanied by meaningful  cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the information 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of our business include but are not limited to the following changes to interest rate levels and stock market performance may impact our lapse rates  market value of our investment portfolio and our ability to sell life insurance products  notwithstanding product features to mitigate the financial impact of such changes  the degree to which our products are accepted by customers and agents including the agents of our alliance partners will impact our future growth rate  extraordinary acts of nature or man may result in higher than expected claim activity  and changes in federal and state income tax laws and regulations may affect the relative tax advantage of our products
