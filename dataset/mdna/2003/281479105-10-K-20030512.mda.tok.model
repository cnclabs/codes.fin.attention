the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our valuation of inventory  allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable  allowance for sales returns  long lived assets and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  however  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  the company considers the following accounting policies to be more dependent on the use of estimates and assumptions revenue recognition revenue from merchandise sales is net of returns and allowances 
the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements  have been applied  and as a result  a reserve is provided for estimated future sales returns 
the company s sales return policy allows the customer to return all purchases for an exchange or refund for up to days after the customer receives the item 
management has estimated and included a reserve for sales returns of  as of february  and the reserve for sales returns is estimated by management using historical sales returns data 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  then the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
management has estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of february  and  respectively inventory management continually estimates and calculates the amount of non current inventory 
the inventory arises due to the company occasionally purchasing book inventory in quantities in excess of what will be sold within the normal operating cycle due to minimum order requirements of the company s primary supplier 
noncurrent inventory was estimated by management using the current year turnover ratio by title 
all inventory in excess of years of anticipated sales was classified as noncurrent inventory 
noncurrent inventory balances were  and  at february  and  respectively 
inventories are presented net of a reserve for obsolete inventory 
management has estimated and included a reserve for obsolescence for both current and noncurrent inventory 
this reserve is based on management s identification of obsolete inventory on hand at february  and management has estimated reserves for both current and noncurrent inventory of  and  as of february  and  respectively 
deferred tax assets as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company does not currently have a valuation allowance recorded against its deferred tax assets 
if management determines it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realizable in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 
long lived assets in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continues to be appropriate
