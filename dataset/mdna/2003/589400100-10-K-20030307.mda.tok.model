item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
the company implemented rate increases in  and plans to make additional filings for rate increases in california as well as other states 
despite the increases  the company believes that its rates will remain competitive in the marketplace 
price and reputation for service are the principal means by which the company competes with other automobile insurers 
the company believes that it has a good reputation for service  and it has  historically  been among the lowest priced insurers doing business in california according to surveys conducted by the california doi 
in addition to good service and competitive pricing  for those insurers dealing through independent agents or brokers  as the company does  the marketing efforts of agents and brokers is also a means of competition 
all rates charged by private passenger automobile insurers are subject to the prior approval of the california doi 
see regulation automobile insurance rating factor regulations 
the company encounters similar competition in each state and each line of business in which it operates outside california 
reinsurance the company maintains property reinsurance under a treaty with swiss re  which is rated a by am best  effective january  prior to october   the treaty provided  coverage in excess of  for each risk subject to a maximum of  for any one occurrence 
a second layer of coverage provides an additional  in excess of the first  per risk 
effective march   a third layer of coverage provides an additional  in excess of the first  for coverage which exceeds  in insured value 
on october   the first layer of the treaty was amended from  in excess of  to  in excess of  the company has in place a treaty reinsurance agreement with swiss re  where risks written under personal umbrella policies are ceded to swiss re on a quota share basis 
the treaty provides million coverage in excess of million for each risk 
the company does not maintain catastrophe reinsurance for property and automobile physical damage business because the company believes it has adequate capitalization to absorb catastrophe losses in these lines 
the company periodically reviews its requirements for catastrophic reinsurance particularly in areas that are prone to catastrophes such as florida and california 
for california  the company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes due to the placement of earthquake risks  written in conjunction with california homeowners policies  with the california earthquake authority 
see regulation california earthquake authority 
although the company s catastrophe exposure to earthquakes has been reduced  the company continues to have catastrophe exposure for fire following an earthquake 
the employer s reinsurance corporation erc reinsured ami through working layer treaties for property and casualty losses in excess of  for the years through the mechanical breakdown line of business was reinsured with constitution reinsurance corporation through a quota share treaty covering to of the business written depending on the year the policy was incepted 
for policies effective on or after january   ami is retaining the full exposure 
ami has other reinsurance treaties and facultative arrangements in place for various smaller lines of business 
all new business written by mcm is ceded to either mcc or ami 
mcm continues to maintain reinsurance treaties with several different reinsurers covering policies prior to january  the company also holds a formal guarantee from erc which reimburses mcm if any of the reinsurers fail to satisfy their obligations under their respective reinsurance agreements 
if the reinsurers were unable to perform their obligations under the reinsurance treaty  the company would be required  as primary insurer  to discharge all obligations to its insureds in their entirety 
regulation the company s business in california is subject to regulation and supervision by the california doi  which has broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers 
the powers of the california doi primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors and the establishment of standards of capital and surplus requirements and solvency which must be met and maintained  restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates 
the regulation and supervision by the california doi are designed principally for the benefit of policyholders and not for insurance company shareholders 
the california doi s market conduct division is responsible for conducting periodic examinations of companies to ensure compliance with california insurance code and california code of regulations with respect to rating  underwriting and claims handling practices 
the most recent examination covered the underwriting and rating practices applied to its homeowners multiple peril  personal automobile  commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile insurance of the california companies and ami during the period january  through december  the report on the examination is pending finalization by the california doi 
the california doi also conducts periodic financial examinations of the company s california domiciled insurance subsidiaries 
the last examination was as of december  the reports on the results of those examinations were issued in june there were no recommended adjustments to the statutory financial statements as filed by the california domiciled insurance subsidiaries 
the insurance subsidiaries outside california are subject to the regulatory powers of the insurance departments of those states 
those powers are similar to the regulatory powers in california enumerated above 
generally  the regulations relate primarily to standards of solvency and are designed for the benefit of policyholders and not of insurance company shareholders 
in california and georgia  insurance rates require prior approval from the state doi  while illinois and texas only require that rates be filed with the doi 
oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the california doi has required all insurers offering persistency discounts to make class plan filings by january   removing the portability of these discounts 
persistency discounts represent discounts on policy rates extended to consumers based upon the number of consecutive years that the consumers carried insurance coverage 
the company made its filing and is currently awaiting doi approval 
the changes made in the company s plan are revenue neutral for the company s existing business 
the removal of persistency discounts could have an impact on the company s price competitiveness in attracting new business 
however  this impact  if any  is undeterminable 
the georgia doi conducted an examination of micga and midga as of december  the reports on the results of that examination are not yet available 
the illinois doi conducted an examination of micil and midil as of december  the reports on that examination are not yet available 
the oklahoma doi conducted an examination of ami as of december  the exam resulted in no material findings or recommendations 
the state of texas commenced an examination of mcm in the fall of the state of florida notified the company of its intent to conduct examinations of micfl and midfl 
the operations of the company are dependent on the laws of the state in which it does business and changes in those laws can materially affect the revenue and expenses of the company 
the company retains its own legislative advocates in california 
the company also makes financial contributions to officeholders and candidates 
in and  those contributions amounted to  and  respectively 
the company believes in supporting the political process and intends to continue to make such contributions in amounts which it determines to be appropriate 
insurance guarantee association the california insurance guarantee association the association was created to provide for payment of claims for which insolvent insurers of most casualty lines are liable but which cannot be paid out of such insurers assets 
the company is subject to assessment by the association for its pro rata share of such claims based on premiums written in the particular line in the year preceding the assessment by insurers writing that line of insurance in california 
insurance subsidiaries in the other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations 
such assessments are based upon estimates of losses to be incurred in liquidating an insolvent insurer 
in a particular year  the company cannot be assessed an amount greater than of its premiums written in the preceding year 
assessments are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders the year after the assessment 
the company accounts for assessments in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  which requires the recognition of a liability when an assessment is levied or information is available indicating that an assessment is probable 
in addition  sop prohibits the recognition of an asset for recoveries related to new business or renewal of short duration policies 
although the company intends to recover assessments through policy surcharges  no such assets have been recorded at december  during  the company paid approximately  to the california insurance guarantee association for an assessment relating to its commercial property business 
in december  the florida insurance guaranty association levied an assessment of approximately  to the company relating primarily to the insolvency of the aries insurance company 
the company expects to recover these assessments in no other assessments were imposed against the company in the last five years 
holding company act the california companies are subject to regulation by the california doi pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
the california doi may examine the affairs of each of the california companies at any time 
the holding company act requires disclosure of any material transactions among the companies 
certain transactions and dividends defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be effected if the california doi disapproves the transaction within days after notice 
such transactions include  but are not limited to  certain reinsurance transactions and sales  purchases  exchanges  loans and extensions of credit  and investments  in the net aggregate  involving more than the lesser of of the respective california companies admitted assets or of surplus as to policyholders  as of the preceding december an extraordinary dividend is a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year 
an insurance company is also required to notify the california doi of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the insurance commissioner 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or of a person that controls a california insurance company  such as mercury general 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the insurance commissioner an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
the insurance subsidiaries in florida  georgia  illinois  oklahoma and texas are subject to holding company acts in those states  the provisions of which are substantially similar to those of the holding company act 
regulatory approval was obtained from california  oklahoma and texas before the acquisition of ami was completed 
approval was granted by texas for the transaction in which the company acquired control of mcm 
assigned risks automobile liability insurers in california are required to sell bodily injury liability  property damage liability  medical expense and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number based on the insurer s share of the california automobile casualty insurance market of those drivers applying for placement as assigned risks 
drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics  as defined by proposition  make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market 
during the last five years  approximately of the direct automobile insurance premium written by the company was for assigned risk business 
in  assigned risks represented of total automobile direct premiums written and of total automobile direct premium earned 
premium rates for assigned risk business are set by the california doi 
in october  more stringent rules for gaining entry into the assigned risk program were approved  resulting in a substantial reduction in the number of assigned risks insured by the company since since january   the california insurance code has required that rates established for this program be adequate to support this program s losses and expenses 
the last rate increase approved by the commissioner approximated and became effective june  the commissioner approved a rate decrease of effective february  the number of assignments decreased in and increased in and the company attributes the low level of assignments to the competitive voluntary market 
automobile insurance rating factor regulations since  california proposition has required that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the insurance commissioner prior to their use  and that no rate be approved which is excessive  inadequate  unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the initiative 
the proposition specified four statutory factors required to be applied in decreasing order of importance in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance the insured s driving safety record  the number of miles the insured drives annually  the number of years of driving experience of the insured and whatever optional factors are determined by the insurance commissioner to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the statute further provided that insurers are required to give at least a discount to good drivers  as defined  from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a good driver 
the company  and most other insurers  historically charged different rates for residents of different geographical areas within california 
the rates for urban areas  particularly in los angeles  have been generally substantially higher than for suburban and rural areas 
the company s geographical rate differentials have been derived by actuarial analysis of the claims costs in a given area 
in september  the california insurance commissioner issued permanent rating factor regulations which were designed to implement the proposition guidelines and replaced emergency regulations which had been in use since they required all automobile insurers in california to submit new rating plans complying with the regulations in early the company submitted its new proposed rating plan on march  the company s plan  and the plans of most other california automobile insurers  were approved by the doi in october the company s plan became effective october  the rate changes resulting from implementation of that plan have not materially affected the company s competitive position or its profitability 
california financial responsibility law effective january   california enacted a new law which requires proof of insurance for the registration new or renewal of a motor vehicle 
it also provides for substantial penalties for failure to supply proof of insurance if a driver is stopped for a traffic violation 
media attention to the new law resulted in a surge of new business applications during the first half of the renewal experience of this new business has been similar to that of the company s existing business 
in november  an initiative sponsored by the california insurance commissioner was overwhelmingly approved by the california voters 
this initiative provides that uninsured drivers who are injured in an automobile accident are able to recover only actual  out of pocket medical expenses and lost wages and are not entitled to receive awards for general damages  ie  pain and suffering 
this restriction also applies to drunk drivers and fleeing felons 
the law has helped in controlling loss costs 
third party bad faith legislation recent initiatives to reinstate third party bad faith lawsuits have been unsuccessful 
if such legislation is enacted  it could have a significant detrimental effect on the company s operating results 
this would particularly be the case if the company had difficulty in implementing rate increases to compensate for increased loss costs 
california earthquake authority the california earthquake authority cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
since  the company places all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowners policy through the california earthquake authority 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon the most recent information provided by the cea  the company s maximum total exposure to cea assessments at april   is approximately million 
terrorism risk insurance act of on november   the federal government enacted the terrorism risk insurance act of the act  which established a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from acts of terrorism  as defined within the act 
the terrorism insurance program the program requires all commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the united states to participate 
the program provides that in the event of a terrorist attack  as defined  resulting in insurance industry losses exceeding million  the us government will provide funding to the insurance industry on an annual aggregate basis of of covered losses up to billion 
each insurance company is subject to a deductible based upon a percentage of the previous year s direct earned premium  with the percentage increasing each year 
the program requires that insurers notify in force commercial policyholders by february  that coverage for terrorism acts is provided and the cost for this coverage 
the company is required to offer this coverage at each subsequent renewal even if the policyholder elected to exclude this coverage in the previous policy period 
the program became effective upon enactment and runs through december  the company writes a limited amount of commercial property policies and does not write policies on properties considered to be a target of terrorist activities such as airports  hotels  large office structures  amusement parks  landmark defined structures or other public facilities 
in addition  there is not a high concentration of policies in any one area where increased exposure to terrorist threats exist 
consequently  the company believes its exposure relating to acts of terrorism is low and consequently  few policyholders will buy this coverage 
item properties the home office of the california companies and the company s computer facilities are located in brea  california in  square feet of office space owned by the company 
the company s executive offices are located in a  square foot office building in los angeles  california  owned by mercury casualty 
the company occupies approximately of the building and leases the remaining office space to others

in most of these actions  plaintiffs assert claims for punitive damages which are not insurable under judicial decisions 
the company has established reserves for lawsuits which the company is able to estimate its potential exposure 
the company vigorously defends these actions  unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate 
the company believes that adverse results  if any  in the actions currently pending should not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial position

the company expects to continue the payment of quarterly dividends  however  the continued payment and amount of cash dividends will depend upon  among other factors  the company s operating results  overall financial condition  capital requirements and general business conditions 
as a holding company  mercury general is largely dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to its shareholders 
these subsidiaries are subject to state laws that restrict their ability to distribute dividends 
the state laws permit a casualty insurance company to pay dividends and advances within any month period  without any prior regulatory approval  in an amount up to the greater of of statutory earned surplus at the preceding december  or statutory net income for the calendar year preceding the date the dividend is paid 
under this test  the direct insurance subsidiaries of the company are entitled to pay dividends to mercury general during of up to approximately million

the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
these cycles can have a large impact on the ability of the company to grow and retain business 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  which was the only state it produced business in prior to the company expanded its operations into georgia and illinois in with the acquisition of american fidelity insurance group afi in december  now ami  the company expanded into the states of oklahoma and texas 
the company expanded its operations into the state of florida during and further expansion into texas occurred with the concord insurance services  inc transaction in december and the mercury county mutual insurance company mcm transaction in september in  the company expanded into virginia and new york 
during  approximately of the company s net premiums written were derived from california 
implementing rate changes varies by state with california and georgia requiring prior approval from the doi before a rate can be implemented 
illinois and texas only require that rates be filed with the doi  while oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
effective march   the company implemented a rate increase for new and renewal california private passenger automobile insurance written by mic  which represents approximately of company wide premiums written  and a combined rate increase for new and renewal california private passenger automobile insurance written by mcc and cal auto  which represent approximately of company wide premiums written 
the company also implemented an additional rate increase for california private passenger automobile insurance written by mic  and an additional rate increase in california private passenger automobile insurance written by mcc and cal auto effective november  effective july   the company implemented a rate increase in florida private passenger automobile insurance and has also taken rate increases in other states where business is written 
the company received approval for an approximate rate increase for florida private passenger automobile insurance  effective february  for new business and march  for renewal business 
a rate increase on the california s homeowner s line of business was approved and became effective on may  the company also received approval for an additional california homeowner s rate increase that was implemented december  the company has pending rate increases on its california private passenger automobile insurance of on mic and on mcc and cal auto 
the company will continue to seek additional rate increases in california as well as other states at a rate that keeps pace with or exceeds loss cost inflation 
despite the increases  the company believes that its rates will remain competitive in the marketplace 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts for name recognition and lead generation 
the company believes that its marketing effort combined with price and reputation makes the company very competitive in california 
since march   private passenger automobile policies in force in california have increased from approximately  to  at december   an annual rate of increase of approximately 
policy count growth for the year was at a rate  an improvement over when the rate was at 
management believes the increase is due in large part to favorable competitive rates  a good reputation and a highly visible and targeted advertising strategy 
in september  the california insurance commissioner issued permanent rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience and whatever optional factors are determined by the insurance commissioner to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the regulations further require that each of the four factors be applied in decreasing order of importance 
the company submitted a proposed rating plan in response to these regulations in march the company s plan was approved by the california doi and became effective october  although the rate changes produced some minor dislocations  implementation of the plan has not materially changed the company s overall competitive position or its profitability 
the california doi has required all insurers offering persistency discounts to make class plan filings by january   removing the portability of these discounts 
persistency discounts represent discounts on policy rates extended to consumers based upon the number of consecutive years that the consumers carried insurance coverage 
the company made it s filing and is currently awaiting doi approval 
the changes made in the company s plan are revenue neutral for the company s existing business 
the removal of persistency discounts could have an impact on the company s price competitiveness in attracting new business 
however  this impact  if any  is undeterminable 
the state of california has completed income tax audits on mercury general s california tax returns for the tax years ended december  through as part of these audits  the california franchise tax board ftb is challenging mercury general s ability to deduct a portion of its management and interest expenses 
upon completion of these audits  the ftb proposed assessments of approximately million  plus interest  for tax years through the company has formally appealed the proposed assessments and expects a hearing before the california state board of equalization sbe will take place in march management strongly disagrees with the positions taken by the ftb and believes that the issues will ultimately be resolved in favor of the company 
accordingly  no provision for additional state income tax liabilities for the tax years through has been made in the consolidated financial statements 
in a recent court ruling that affects the tax years through  a statute that allowed mercury general a tax deduction for the dividends received from its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries was held unconstitutional on the grounds that it discriminated against out of state insurance holding companies 
based on the court ruling  the ftb is taking the position that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute is invalid 
as a result  the ftb is disallowing dividend received deductions for all insurance holding companies  regardless of domicile  for tax years ending on or after december  see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has been assessed million plus interest for the through tax years 
the company intends to protest the proposed assessments 
the ftb has recently begun an audit of the tax year 
this ruling by the court has confused certain long standing aspects of the california tax law and has already resulted in legislative proposals for relief which  if approved  would reduce or eliminate the amount of the ftb s proposed assessment against the company 
in addition  without such legislation  years of future litigation may be required to determine the ultimate outcome 
consequently  the ultimate amount that the company may be required to pay is impossible to predict at the present time and the company has not recorded a provision for additional state income tax liabilities related to this matter 
management has taken actions to minimize any potential tax liabilities on and future inter company dividends 
however  if management s actions are ineffective or the issue is not resolved favorably with the state of california  additional state taxes of approximately after the federal tax benefit of deducting state taxes could be owed on dividends mercury general receives from its insurance subsidiaries 
while the company intends to continue paying dividends to its shareholders  an unsatisfactory conclusion to the inter company dividend issue could affect future dividend policy 
the company is also involved in proceedings incidental to its insurance business see item legal proceedings  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgment and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
inflation is reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date 
since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provision 
the company complies with the sfas no 
definition of how insurance enterprises should recognize revenue on insurance policies written 
the company s insurance premiums are recognized as income ratably over the term of the policies 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs to related unearned premiums 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become substantially unprofitable  then a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the company does not expect this to occur on any of its significant lines of business 
the company carries its fixed maturity and equity investments at market value as required for securities classified as available for sale by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

in most cases  market valuations were drawn from trade data sources 
in no case were any valuations made by the company s management 
equity holdings  including non sinking fund preferred stocks  are  with minor exceptions  actively traded on national exchanges  and were valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet date 
the company constantly evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines and writes them off as realized losses through the statement of income  as required by sfas no 
when recovery of the net book value appears doubtful 
temporary unrealized investment gains and losses are credited or charged directly to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
it is possible that future information will become available about the company s current investments that would require accounting for them as realized losses due to other than temporary declines in value 
the financial statement effect would be to move the unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet to realized investment losses on the statements of income 
the company may have certain known and unknown potential liabilities that are evaluated using the criteria established by sfas no 
these include claims  assessments or lawsuits incidental to our business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them or discloses them in the financial statement footnotes if they meet the requirements stated in sfas no 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities  management does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated operations or financial position

sfas no 
changes the method by which companies may recognize intangible assets in purchase business combinations and generally requires identifiable intangible assets to be recognized separately from goodwill 
in addition  it eliminates the amortization of all existing and newly acquired goodwill on a prospective basis and requires companies to assess goodwill for impairment  at least annually  based on the fair value of the reporting unit 
at december   the company had on its books approximately million in goodwill related to the acquisition of concord and approximately million of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives related to the mcm acquisition 
as required by sfas no

 the company did not amortize these assets after total amortization expense in related to these assets was million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased and net premiums written in of  million increased over amounts recorded in these premium increases were principally attributable to increased policy sales and rate increases in the california automobile insurance lines  california homeowners insurance  florida automobile insurance and texas automobile insurance 
the california private passenger automobile insurance marketplace is experiencing rising premium rates 
the company and virtually all of its competitors have filed and implemented rate increases  which helped spur the company s premium growth during see overview 
the gaap loss ratio in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in the lower loss ratio was primarily driven by rate increases which were partially offset by rising loss severity trends and adverse loss development from prior periods 
the gaap expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was in and in while expenses generally increased in  the increase was at a slightly lower rate than the increase in premium volume 
the majority of expenses vary directly with premiums

the gaap loss ratio loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was in and in the less favorable loss ratio is primarily driven by higher loss ratios in the california automobile and homeowners lines of business which are primarily offset by lower loss ratios in florida  georgia and illinois automobile lines of business 
the gaap expense ratio in policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in the expense ratio was relatively unchanged as total expenses increased at essentially the same rate as premium volume 
the majority of expenses vary directly with premiums

under current insurance law  mercury general s insurance subsidiaries are entitled to pay  without extraordinary approval  dividends of approximately million in  less dividends paid during the preceding twelve month period 
the actual amount of dividends paid from insurance subsidiaries to mercury general during was million 
as of december   mercury general also had approximately million in fixed maturity securities  equity securities and cash that can be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations 
the principal sources of funds for mercury general s insurance subsidiaries are premiums  sales and maturity of invested assets and dividend and interest income from invested assets 
the principal uses of funds for mercury general s insurance subsidiaries are the payment of claims and related expenses  operating expenses  dividends to mercury general and the purchase of investments 
mercury general s insurance subsidiaries generate substantial positive cash flows  particularly when the company experiences growth  from operations as premiums are typically received in advance of the time when claim payments are required 
the company expects cash flow from operations along with its cash and short term cash investment portfolio of million to continue to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements 
management increased cash and short term cash investments by nearly million when other longer term investment opportunities were considered unattractive as a result of the current interest rate environment 
net cash provided from operating activities in was million  an increase of million over this increase was primarily due to the growth in premiums collected of million over  reflecting increases in both policy sales and rates partially offset by an increase in losses paid in the company has reinvested a portion of cash provided by operating activities in the construction of additional office space and the purchase and development of information technology 
excess cash not used in investing and financing activities was invested in short term cash investments 
funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of investments of million  were reinvested by the company generally in higher rated fixed maturity and equity securities 
the market value of all investments held at market as available for sale exceeded the amortized cost of  million at december  by million 
that unrealized gain  reflected in shareholders equity  as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable tax effects  was million at december  compared with a gain of million at december  the increase in unrealized gains at december  is due mainly to the write down of investments that the company considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
as of december   the average standard poor s rating of the  million bond portfolio at amortized cost was aa  while the average effective maturity  giving effect to anticipated early call provisions  approximates years 
the modified duration of the bond portfolio at year end was years which includes collateralized mortgage obligations and short term cash investments 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest income 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a much better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
municipal bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically and by obligor 
traditionally  it has been the company s policy not to invest in high yield or junk bonds 
at december   bond holdings rated below investment grade totaled million at market cost million  or less than of total assets 
an increase in the portfolio s average rating from a at december  to aa at december  reflects a larger percentage of the portfolio invested in higher rated municipal bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations while divesting lower rated corporate bonds 
fixed maturity investments of  million amortized cost  include million amortized cost of sinking fund preferred stocks  principally utility issues 
the market value of all fixed maturities exceeded cost by million at december  the company has recently commenced writing covered call options through listed exchanges and over the counter with the intent of generating additional income or return on capital 
the company as the writer of an option bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written option 
the options written thus far have been covered call options on equity securities that it already owns as mandated by statutory regulation 
the financial impact of these transactions was not significant in the board of directors has authorized investments in underlying securities for this program not to exceed million 
equity holdings of million at market cost million  including perpetual preferred issues  are largely confined to the public utility and finance sectors and represent about of total shareholders equity 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of its investment holdings 
when a decline in value of fixed maturities or equity securities is considered other than temporary  the company writes the security down to fair value by recognizing a loss in the consolidated statement of income 
the company recognized losses of million of investment write downs considered to be other than temporarily impaired during declines in value considered to be temporary  are charged as unrealized losses  net of taxes to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   the company had a net unrealized gain on all investments of million before income taxes which is comprised of unrealized gains of million offset by unrealized losses of million 
of these unrealized losses  approximately million relate to fixed maturities which are current on their debt servicing obligations 
the remaining unrealized losses of approximately million relate to equity securities for which approximately of the unrealized losses represent securities with unrealized losses of less than of their amortized costs 
the company has concluded that the gross unrealized losses of million at december  were temporary in nature 
however  facts and circumstances may change which could result in a decline in market value considered to be other than temporary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised of total investments at market value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities  consisting primarily of preferred stocks  account for of total investments at market 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s investment philosophy has resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
due to the current interest rate environment  management believes it prudent to reduce the duration of the company s bond portfolio 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
consequently  the modified duration of the bond portfolio excluding collateralized obligations and short term cash investments  declined from years at december  to years at december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
at december   the company s strategy for common equity investments was a buy and hold strategy which focuses primarily on current income with a secondary focus on capital appreciation 
the value of the common equity investments consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the non sinking fund preferred stocks are typically valued using credit spreads to u 
s 
treasury benchmarks 
this causes them to be comparable to fixed income securities in terms of interest rate risk 
during most of the year  non sinking fund preferred stocks were not actively traded by the market  though lower interest rates intrinsically benefit their market values 
at december   the duration on the company s non sinking fund preferred stock portfolio was years 
this implies that an upward parallel shift in the yield curve by basis points would reduce the asset value at december  by approximately million  everything else remaining the same 
the remainder of the equity portfolio  representing of total investments at market value  consists primarily of public utility common stocks 
these assets are theoretically defensive in nature and therefore have low volatility to changes in market price as measured by their beta 
however  the company did not experience low volatility in beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligation on its million fixed rate senior notes for a floating rate 
the interest rate swap has the effect of hedging the fair value of the senior notes
