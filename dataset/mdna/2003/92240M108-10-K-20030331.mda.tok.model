item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview we are a holding company for a number of businesses 
we are engaged principally in o the development and marketing of the low nicotine and nicotine free quest cigarette products and the reduced carcinogen omni cigarette products through our subsidiary vector tobacco inc and o the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states through our subsidiary liggett group inc during  the sales and marketing functions  along with certain support functions  of our liggett and vector tobacco subsidiaries were combined into a new entity  liggett vector brands inc this company coordinates and executes the sales and marketing efforts for all of our tobacco operations 
with the combined resources of liggett and vector tobacco  liggett vector brands has approximately salespersons  and enhanced distribution and marketing capabilities 
our majority owned subsidiary  new valley corporation  is currently engaged in the real estate business and is seeking to acquire additional operating companies 
in december  new valley acquired two office buildings in princeton  nj and increased its ownership to in montauk battery realty llc  which owns the largest residential brokerage company in the new york metropolitan area 
in november  vector tobacco launched nationwide omni  the first reduced carcinogen cigarette that tastes  smokes and burns like other premium cigarettes 
the omni cigarettes are produced using a patent pending process developed by vector tobacco 
in comparison to comparable styles of the leading us cigarette brand  omni cigarettes produce significantly lower levels of many of the recognized carcinogens and toxins that the medical community has identified as major contributors to lung cancer and other diseases in smokers 
during  acceptance of omni in the marketplace was limited  with revenues of approximately  on sales of million units 
vector tobacco has been unable to date to achieve the anticipated breadth of distribution and sales of the omni product  due  in part  to the lack of success of its advertising and marketing efforts in differentiating omni with consumers through the reduced carcinogen message 
over the next several years  management plans to conduct appropriate studies as to the effects of omni s reduction of carcinogens and  based on these studies  to review the marketing and positioning of the omni brand in order to formulate a strategy for its long term success 
in january  vector tobacco introduced quest  its brand of low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products 
quest is designed for adult smokers who are interested in reducing their levels of nicotine intake and is available in three different varieties  each with decreasing amounts of nicotine quest  and quest  the low nicotine variety  contains milligrams of nicotine 
quest  the extra low nicotine variety  contains milligrams of nicotine 
quest  the nicotine free variety  contains only trace levels of nicotine no more than milligrams of nicotine per cigarette 
quest cigarettes utilize a proprietary process that enables the production of nicotine free tobacco that tastes and smokes like tobacco in conventional cigarettes 
quest will be initially available in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  ohio  indiana  illinois and michigan 
these seven states account for approximately of all cigarette sales in the united states 
based on the success of the product in these markets  vector tobacco currently expects to market quest nationwide later in all three quest varieties are being sold in hard packs and are priced comparable to other premium brands 
a multi million dollar advertising and marketing campaign  with advertisements running in magazines and regional newspapers  is supporting the product launch 
the brand is also supported by significant point of purchase campaigns 
our domestic cigarette business  liggett  shipped approximately billion cigarettes during which accounted for of the total cigarettes shipped in the united states during that year 
approximately of liggett s unit sales in were generated in the discount segment 
we believe that liggett has gained a sustainable cost advantage over its competitors through its various settlement agreements 
under the master settlement agreement reached in november with state attorneys general and various territories  liggett s four major competitors must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually 
liggett  however  is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us cigarette market 
additionally  as a result of the medallion acquisition  vector tobacco likewise has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us market 
in recent years  the domestic tobacco business has experienced the following trends o declining unit volumes due to health considerations  diminishing social acceptance of smoking  legislative limitations on smoking in public places  federal and state excise tax increases and settlement related expenses which have augmented cigarette prices  o narrower price spreads between the premium and traditional discount segments resulting from aggressive premium price promotions by larger competitors including philip morris and rjr  while price spreads between the premium and deep discount markets widen due to the influx of smaller companies producing low quality  deep discount cigarettes  and o loss of discount market share for branded discount cigarettes such as those sold by liggett due to a significant increase in market share by the smaller cigarette companies producing low quality  deep discount cigarettes 
recent developments liggett vector brands 
during  the sales and marketing functions  along with certain support functions  of our liggett and vector tobacco subsidiaries were combined into a new entity  liggett vector brands inc this company coordinates and executes the sales and marketing efforts for all of our tobacco operations 
with the combined resources of liggett and vector tobacco  liggett vector brands has approximately salespersons  and enhanced distribution and marketing capabilities 
in connection with the formation of the new liggett vector brands entity  we took a charge of approximately  in the first quarter of  related to the reorganization of our business 
as of december   our reorganization accrual has been reduced by payments and impairments of  and the remaining balance was acquisition of medallion 
on april   a subsidiary of ours acquired the stock of the medallion company  inc  and related assets from medallion s principal stockholder 
the total purchase price consisted of  in cash and  in notes  with the notes guaranteed by us and liggett 
medallion  a discount cigarette manufacturer  is a participant in the master settlement agreement between the state attorneys general and the tobacco industry 
medallion has no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement unless its market share exceeds approximately of total cigarettes sold in the united states approximately billion units in

real estate acquisitions 
in december  new valley purchased two office buildings in princeton  nj for a total purchase price of  new valley financed a portion of the purchase price through a borrowing of  from hsbc realty credit corporation usa 
the loan has a term of four years  bears interest at a floating rate of above libor  and is collateralized by a first mortgage on the office buildings  as well as by an assignment of leases and rents

the loan may be prepaid without penalty and is non recourse against new valley  except for various specified environmental and related matters  misapplications of tenant security deposits and insurance and condemnation proceeds  and fraud or misrepresentation by new valley in connection with the indebtedness 
also in december  new valley and the other owners of prudential long island realty contributed their interests in prudential long island realty to montauk battery realty  a newly formed entity 
new valley acquired a ownership interest in montauk  an increase from its previous interest in prudential long island realty as a result of an additional investment of  by new valley and the redemption by prudential long island realty of various ownership interests 
on march   montauk purchased the leading new york city based residential brokerage firm  insignia douglas elliman  and an affiliated property management company  for  as a result of the acquisition  montauk s brokerage operations  to be known as prudential douglas elliman  will be the largest residential brokerage company in the new york metropolitan area 
new valley invested an additional  in subordinated debt and equity of montauk to help fund the acquisition 
recent developments in legislation  regulation and litigation the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of december   there were approximately individual suits  purported class actions and governmental and other third party payor health care reimbursement actions pending in the united states in which liggett was a named defendant 
a civil lawsuit has been filed by the united states federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately  from various cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
in addition to these cases  during  an action against cigarette manufacturers involving approximately  named individual plaintiffs was consolidated before a single west virginia state court 
liggett is a defendant in most of the cases pending in west virginia 
approximately other purported class action complaints have been filed against the cigarette manufacturers for alleged antitrust violations 
as new cases are commenced  the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase 
an unfavorable verdict was returned in the first phase of the engle smoking and health class action trial pending in florida 
in july  the jury awarded  in punitive damages against liggett in the second phase of the trial  and the court entered an order of final judgment 
liggett intends to pursue all available post trial and appellate remedies 
if this verdict is not eventually reversed on appeal  or substantially reduced by the court  it will have a material adverse effect on vector 
liggett filed the  bond required under the bonding statute enacted in by the florida legislature which limits the size of any bond required  pending appeal  to stay execution of a punitive damages verdict 
in may  liggett reached an agreement with the class in the engle case  which will provide assurance to liggett that the stay of execution  currently in effect under the florida bonding statute  will not be lifted or limited at any point until completion of all appeals  including to the united states supreme court 
as required by the agreement  liggett paid  into an escrow account to be held for the benefit of the engle class  and released  along with liggett s existing  statutory bond  to the court for the benefit of the class upon completion of the appeals process  regardless of the outcome of the appeal 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
the verdict will be subject to the outcome of the engle appeal 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
in recent years  there have been a number of restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies  including the united states environmental protection agency and the food and drug administration 
there have also been adverse political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry  including the commencement and certification of class actions and the commencement of third party payor actions 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
we are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation  but our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any smoking related litigation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of legislation  regulation and litigation 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates subject to material changes in the near term include deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  promotional accruals  sales returns and allowances  actuarial assumptions of pension plans and litigation and defense costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of cigarettes are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods to customers 
we provide an allowance for expected sales returns  net of related inventory cost recoveries 
since our primary line of business is tobacco  our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely effected by significant unit sales volume declines  litigation and defense costs  increased tobacco costs or reductions in the selling price of cigarettes in the near term 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  effective january   we adopted new required accounting standards mandating that certain sales incentives previously reported as operating  selling  general and administrative expenses be shown as a reduction of operating revenues 
as a result  our previously reported revenues have been reduced by approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the adoption of the new accounting standards did not have an impact on our net earnings or basic or diluted earnings per share 
marketing costs 
we record marketing costs as an expense in the period to which such costs relate 
we do not defer the recognition of any amounts on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to marketing costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred  which is the period in which the related advertisement initially appears 
we record consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as an expense in the period in which these programs are offered  based on estimates of utilization and redemption rates that are developed from historical information 
as discussed above under revenue recognition  beginning january   we have adopted the previously mentioned revenue recognition accounting standards that mandate that certain costs previously reported as marketing expense be shown as a reduction of operating revenues 
as a result  previously reported amounts for operating  selling  general and administrative expenses have been reduced by approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the adoption of the new accounting standards did not have an impact on our net earnings or basic or diluted earnings per share 
contingencies 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements and above under the heading recent developments in legislation  regulation and litigation  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various jurisdictions against liggett 
management is unable to make a meaningful estimate with respect to the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending smoking related litigation or the costs of defending such cases  and we have not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such smoking related litigation 
inventories 
tobacco inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined primarily by the last in  first out lifo method at liggett and the first in  first out fifo method at vector tobacco 
although portions of leaf tobacco inventories may not be used or sold within one year because of time required for aging  they are included in current assets  which is common practice in the industry 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
employee benefit plans 
since  income from our defined benefit pension plans  partially offset by the costs of postretirement medical and life insurance benefits  have contributed to our reported operating income including for the determination of our net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized income or expense in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our future net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense 
based on the declines in the securities markets  we recorded a non cash charge of  net of tax to stockholders equity in the fourth quarter of relating primarily to one of liggett s defined benefit plans 
the charge was based on the extent to which our accumulated benefit obligations under the pension plan on september  exceeded the fair value of the pension plan s assets on that date 
we also currently anticipate net pension expense for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit expense aggregating approximately  for in contrast  our funding obligations under the pension plans are governed by erisa 
to comply with erisa s minimum funding requirements  we do not currently anticipate that we will be required to make any funding to the pension plans for the pension plan year beginning on january  and ending on december  any additional funding obligation that we may have for subsequent years is contingent on several factors and is not reasonably estimable at this time 
results of operations the following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations  capital resources and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

we believe  and have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that brooke group holding and liggett have a number of valid defenses to claims asserted against them 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
an unfavorable verdict was returned in the first phase of the engle smoking and health class action trial pending in florida 
in july  the jury awarded  in punitive damages against liggett in the second phase of the trial  and the court entered an order of final judgment 
liggett intends to pursue all available post trial and appellate remedies 
if this verdict is not eventually reversed on appeal  or substantially reduced by the court  it will have a material adverse effect on vector 
liggett has filed the  bond required under the bonding statute enacted in by the florida legislature which limits the size of any bond required  pending appeal  to stay execution of a punitive damages verdict 
in may  liggett reached an agreement with the class in the engle case  which will provide assurance to liggett that the stay of execution  currently in effect pursuant to the florida bonding statute  will not be lifted or limited at any point until completion of all appeals  including to the united states supreme court 
as required by the agreement  liggett paid  into an escrow account to be held for the benefit of the engle class  and released  along with liggett s existing  statutory bond  to the court for the benefit of the class upon completion of the appeals process  regardless of the outcome of the appeal 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
the verdict will be subject to the outcome of the engle appeal 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
an unfavorable outcome of a pending smoking and health case could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
in recent years  there have been a number of adverse regulatory  political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
neither we nor liggett are able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation or regulation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against brooke group holding or liggett or the costs of defending such cases 
it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation
