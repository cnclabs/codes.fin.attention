item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the years ended december  and december  the following also includes a discussion of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this filing 
this filing contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results described or implied by these forward looking statements 
see note on forward looking statements 
we utilize two non gaap measures  operating income and operating return on equity to measure our performance 
we currently use these measures to evaluate the underlying fundamentals of our operations and believe them to be useful measures of our corporate performance 
we define operating income as net income which excludes net realized gains and losses from the sale of investments and certain one time adjustments 
realized gains and losses from the sale of investments are derived from the timing of the sale of investments and are not derived from our operating performance 
operating return on equity is calculated by dividing operating income by the average net book value of our common equity for the year 
in calculating operating income  we have also excluded a one time charge occurring in o in  we adopted a new accounting pronouncement  sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
during  after completing our initial impairment review of our goodwill  we decided to reflect goodwill at zero value and record a write off of million 
therefore  we felt it was appropriate to exclude this charge from our calculation of operating income  because this was associated with a one time adoption of a new accounting principle  and we wrote off of our balance of goodwill 
overview renaissancere holdings ltd 
was originally formed to provide reinsurance to cover the risk of natural and man made catastrophes 
we use sophisticated computer models to construct a superior portfolio of these coverages 
our disciplined underwriting approach  sophisticated risk models and management expertise have established us as a leader in the property catastrophe reinsurance business and led to consistent strong performance and growth for our company 
our principal business is property catastrophe reinsurance 
our subsidiary renaissance reinsurance is one of the world s premier providers of this coverage 
our coverages protect against large natural catastrophes  such as earthquakes and hurricanes  as well as claims arising from other natural and man made catastrophes such as winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes and explosions 
we offer this coverage to insurance companies and other reinsurers primarily on an excess of loss basis 
this means that we begin paying when our customers claims from a catastrophe exceed a certain retained amount 
we use our advanced proprietary modeling and management systems to maximize our return on equity  subject to prudent risk constraints 
recently  we have experienced substantial growth in premiums from specialty lines of reinsurance written by renaissance reinsurance  including such lines as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  property per risk  aviation and finite reinsurance 
we refer to these premiums as specialty reinsurance 
during we more than tripled our gross written premiums from specialty reinsurance to million from million written in we have also experienced substantial growth in our individual risk business written on an excess and surplus lines basis by glencoe 
we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our individual risk segment currently provides insurance for commercial and homeowners catastrophe exposed property business  and also provides reinsurance to other insureds on a quota share basis 
we significantly increased the gross written premiums of our individual risk operations to million  compared to million in in addition  we also manage property catastrophe reinsurance on behalf of two joint ventures 
in we formed top layer reinsurance ltd 
top layer re with state farm to provide high layer coverage for non us risks 
renaissance reinsurance and state farm each own of top layer re 
we formed davinci reinsurance ltd 
davinci in with state farm and other private investors to write property catastrophe reinsurance side by side with renaissance reinsurance 
we own a minority of davinci s outstanding equity but control a majority of its outstanding voting power  and accordingly  davinci s financial results are consolidated in our financial statements 
we also previously acted as underwriting manager for opcat  however in february  opcat s parent company  overseas partners limited  decided to exit the reinsurance business  and we subsequently assumed the in force book of business of opcat 
we act as the exclusive underwriting manager for these joint ventures in return for management fees and a profit participation such fees earned from davinci are eliminated in consolidation 
together  these joint ventures wrote million of premium in  compared to million in in total  as of december   top layer re and davinci had access to approximately billion of capital resources  which includes billion of limit through reinsurance provided by state farm 
we believe that our position as a leading property catastrophe reinsurance underwriter is reflected by the continued growth in the gross property catastrophe premiums written by renaissance reinsurance and our joint ventures which  when combined  we refer to as managed catastrophe premiums 
the total managed catastrophe premiums written on behalf of renaissance reinsurance and our joint ventures increased by in to million from million in the occurrence of the world trade center disaster in and the significant losses stemming from this event caused an imbalance in the supply and demand for reinsurance capacity 
as a result of this increase in demand  we increased our reinsurance operations  both in our established property catastrophe line and in specialty reinsurance  and we also increased our individual risk operations written through glencoe insurance 
accordingly  during we more than doubled our gross written premiums to  million from million of gross written premiums in also  for the year ended december   our operating income available to common shareholders more than doubled to million from million for the year ended december  operating income is net income excluding realized gains and losses on investments  and for operating income also excludes a million write off of goodwill 
our net income available to common shareholders also more than doubled during to million from million for the same period during during our total assets increased by billion  or  to billion 
at december   total shareholders equity attributable to common shareholders was billion and our book value per common share was  compared with billion and per share at december  because we write reinsurance and insurance which provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events  and the coverage we offer to clients impacted by these events 
in addition to the reinsurance and insurance coverages discussed above  from time to time  we consider opportunistic diversification into new ventures  either through organic growth or the acquisition of other companies or books of business of other companies 
we may explore opportunities in lines of insurance or reinsurance business in which we have limited experience  such as certain casualty coverages 
if these opportunities come to fruition  they will present us with additional management and operational risks for which we will need to further develop our resources to effectively manage this expansion 
in evaluating such new ventures  we seek an attractive return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities that will not detract from our core reinsurance and individual risk operations 
accordingly  we regularly review strategic opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  although there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates for almost all property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimate of the claims and claim expense reserves 
claim reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred  and it is possible that the ultimate liability may materially exceed or be materially less than such estimates 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency and other variable factors such as inflation 
adjustments to our prior year estimated claims reserves will impact our current year net income by increasing our net income if the prior year estimated claims reserves are determined to be overstated  or by reducing our net income if the prior year estimated claims reserves prove to be insufficient 
during the years ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves  had the following impact on our net income  during  prior years estimated claims reserves were overstated by million and accordingly  our net income was increased by million  during  prior years estimated claims reserves were overstated by million  and our net income was increased by million  and during  prior years estimated claims reserves were deficient by million  and our net income was decreased by million 
also see financial condition reserves for claims and claims expenses 
for our property catastrophe reinsurance operations  we initially set our case reserves based on case reserves and other reserve estimates reported by insureds and ceding companies 
we then add to these case reserves  our estimates for additional case reserves  and an estimate for incurred but not reported reserves ibnr 
these estimates are normally based upon our experience with similar claims  our knowledge of potential industry loss levels for each loss  and industry information which we gather and retain in our rems c modeling system 
our estimates of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims 
in reserving for our individual risk and specialty reinsurance coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in these lines  and therefore we estimate our ibnr for our specialty reinsurance and individual risk coverages by utilizing an actuarial method known as the bornhuetter ferguson technique 
it is common for insurance and reinsurance companies to utilize this method for lines of business where a company may have limited historical loss experience 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson technique requires a company to estimate an ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for each line of business 
we select our estimates of the ultimate claims and claim expense ratios by reviewing industry standards  and adjusting these standards based upon the coverages we offer and the terms of the coverages we offer 
all of our estimates are reviewed annually with an independent actuarial firm 
we also review our assumptions and our methodologies on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that our estimates need adjusting  such adjustments are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
although we believe we are cautious in our assumptions  and in the application of these methodologies  we cannot be certain that our ultimate payments will not vary  perhaps materially  from the estimates we have made 
adjustments to our loss reserves can impact current year net income by either increasing net income if the estimates of prior year loss reserves proves to be overstated or by decreasing net income if the estimates of prior year loss reserves proves to be insufficient 
as of december   our estimated ibnr reserves were million  and a change in such ibnr reserves  would equate to a million adjustment to claims and claim expenses incurred  which would represent of our net income  and of shareholders equity as at december  we incurred claims and claim expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our claims and claim expense reserves were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
other material judgments made by us are the estimates of potential impairments in asset valuations  particularly potential uncollectible reinsurance recoverables  and impairments in our deferred tax asset 
to estimate reinsurance recoverables which might be uncollectible  our senior managers evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers  on a reinsurer by reinsurer basis  both before purchasing the reinsurance protection from them and after the occurrence of a significant catastrophic event 
as of december   we have recoverables of million and we have recorded a valuation allowance of million  based on specific facts and circumstances evaluated by management 
as of december   the majority of the million of losses recoverable relate to outstanding claims reserves on our books  and in accordance with the terms of the policies  we generally must wait to collect from our reinsurers until we pay the underlying claims 
we expect to fully collect the recorded net balance of the losses recoverable 
there has been little change in our reinsurance recoverables or our valuation allowance at december  as compared to due to the relatively low level of catastrophe losses during  the slowdown in payments of older claims  specifically claims resulting form the world trade center disaster  and the continued financial strength of our reinsurers 
in estimating impairments to our deferred tax asset  we analyze the businesses which generated the deferred tax asset  and the businesses that will potentially utilize the deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax asset relates primarily to net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxes payable of our us operating subsidiaries 
however  due to the limited opportunities in the us primary insurance market  the us insurance operations have not generated taxable income in the last few years 
this calls into question the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
although we retain the benefit of this asset through  during  and we recorded valuation allowances of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the gross balance of the deferred tax asset was million and the net balance of the deferred tax asset was million 
summary of results of operations for and a summary of the significant components of our revenues and expenses are as follows year ended december  in thousands net underwriting income renaissance    net underwriting income davinci  total underwriting income reinsurance    net underwriting income loss individual risk    other income    net investment income    interest and preferred share dividends    corporate expenses  taxes other    minority interest davinci  net operating income available to common shareholders    net realized gains losses on investments    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net income available to common shareholders    operating income per common share diluted net income per common share diluted net underwriting income consists of net premiums earned less claims and claim expenses incurred  acquisition costs and operational expenses 
net operating income excludes realized gains and losses on investments and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the million increase in net operating income in  compared to  was primarily the result of the following items o a million increase in underwriting income from our reinsurance operations due primarily to an increase in net earned premiums to million from million  primarily due to the market imbalances after the world trade center disaster which enabled us to increase our property catastrophe reinsurance premiums and more than triple our premiums from specialty reinsurance as discussed above 
also  in large part as a result of lower catastrophe losses during the year  our loss ratio decreased in to compared with a loss ratio of in the loss ratio was higher due to losses emanating from the world trade center disaster  plus o the million of underwriting income from the start up of davinci during  however after offsetting this with the million increase related to the interests owned by other investors  the net increase to our net income was million  plus o a million increase in underwriting income from our individual risk operations which resulted from the increase in our gross written premiums in our individual risk segment to million in from million in  which was the result of the market imbalances as noted above  plus o a million increase in other income  which was primarily due to an increase of million in income from our top layer re joint venture  plus o a million increase in net investment income during the year  which was primarily due to the million increase in our assets from our net capital raising activities in the second half of and the million increase in our assets during  primarily resulting from the million of cash flows generated from our operating activities during the impact of the increase in available assets was partially offset by a reduction in investment returns due to lower interest rates  plus o a million reduction in corporate expenses  taxes and other  which was primarily due to the fact that in we decided to increase our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset by million as a result of further reductions of our us based insurance  less o a million increase in interest and fixed charges  which are primarily the result of the issuance of million of debt in july  and the issuance of million of our series a preference shares in november the million increase in net operating income in  compared to  was primarily the result of the following items o a million increase in underwriting income from our reinsurance operations due primarily to an increase in net premiums earned of million  in part offset by a million increase in claims  plus o an increase in fee income from our joint ventures of million  primarily as a result of fees earned in on premiums written on behalf of our joint ventures in  plus o a reduction in interest and fixed charges of million resulting primarily from the repayment of million of outstanding bank loans in the fourth quarter of  less o an increase in tax expense during as a result of a million increase to our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset as a result of further reductions of our us based insurance operations  less o an increase in corporate expenses of million primarily due to costs related to research and development initiatives conducted by us in  less o a decrease in investment income of million primarily as a result of declining interest rates 
results of operations for and the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december   compared to each of the years ended december   and  and a discussion of our financial condition at december  premiums gross written premiums year ended december  in thousands cat premium renaissance    davinci  assumed from opcat  total cat premium    specialty reinsurance    total reinsurance    individual risk premium    total gross written premiums    excludes million of premium ceded to renaissance reinsurance and davinci in the increase in our property catastrophe premiums over the past two years is primarily due to an improving market following the world trade center disaster in and insured losses from nine significant worldwide catastrophic events in hail storms in sydney  australia  tornados in oklahoma  hurricane floyd in the us  typhoon bart in japan  turkish and taiwanese earthquakes  danish windstorm  anatol  and the french windstorms  lothar and martin 
six of these events each resulted in over billion of insured damages 
because of these events  as with many large losses  two changes occurred many reinsurers recorded significant losses and were forced to  or chose to  withdraw their underwriting capacity from these regions  and these losses raised the awareness of the severity of the losses which could impact these geographic locations 
as a result of these factors  prices for reinsurance coverages in these and other geographic locations increased  in some cases significantly 
accordingly  our reinsurance premiums also increased  firstly from the increased prices on renewing policies and secondly by enabling us to write new business which was previously priced at an uneconomical rate of return 
also contributing to our increased written premiums in was the inception of davinci  which wrote million of gross written premiums 
the factors that caused the improved market conditions in the property catastrophe market also contributed to improving market conditions in the lines of specialty reinsurance which we write and accordingly  we began writing an increased level of specialty reinsurance premiums in and  subsequent to the world trade center disaster  we significantly increased our participation in this market 
we categorize our specialty reinsurance premiums as reinsurance coverages that are not specifically property catastrophe coverages 
examples of specialty lines of reinsurance premiums provided by us include catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  property per risk  aviation and finite reinsurance 
we expect specialty reinsurance written premiums be a significant contributor to our overall written premiums in the market conditions that caused the improvements in the property catastrophe market and the specialty reinsurance market have also caused improvements in the individual risk market  and accordingly  during we significantly increased our premiums in the individual risk market 
we define the individual risk market as underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our individual risk segment currently provides insurance for commercial and homeowners catastrophe exposed property business  and also provides reinsurance to other insureds on a quota share basis 
we expect individual risk written premiums to be a significant contributor to our overall written premiums in gross premiums written by geographic region years ended december  in thousands property catastrophe united states and caribbean    worldwide    europe    worldwide excluding u 
s    other    australia and new zealand    specialty reinsurance    total reinsurance    individual risk    total gross premiums written    the category worldwide excluding us consists of contracts that cover more than one geographic region other than the us the exposure in this category for gross written premiums written to date is predominantly from europe and japan 
the category specialty reinsurance consist of contracts that are predominantly exposed to us risks  with a small portion of the risks being worldwide 
the category individual risk is made up of contracts that are primarily exposed to us risks 
ceded reinsurance premiums ceded premiums years ended december  in thousands reinsurance    individual risk    total gross written premiums ceded    excludes million of premium ceded to renaissance reinsurance and davinci in because of the potential volatility of the property catastrophe reinsurance business  we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses 
we utilize our rems c modeling system to evaluate how each purchase interacts with our portfolio of reinsurance contracts we write  and with the other ceded reinsurance contracts we purchase 
during and  we increased our purchases of reinsurance because we received a number of new opportunities to purchase reinsurance 
also affecting the increase in our ceded reinsurance premiums were placements of structured quota share reinsurance agreements for participations in our property catastrophe book of business 
in accordance with these agreements we retain fees and have the right to receive profit commissions associated with these cessions 
the fees and profit commissions are reflected as a reduction to operating expenses and acquisition expenses  respectively 
although we would remain liable to the extent that any of our reinsurers fails to pay our claims  before placing reinsurance we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers 
as of december   the majority of the million of losses recoverable relate to outstanding claims reserves on our books  and in accordance with the terms of the policies  we generally must wait to collect from our reinsurers until we pay the underlying claims 
we expect to fully collect the recorded net balance of the losses recoverable 
to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the potential volatility of our results 
underwriting results the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its loss ratio  expense ratio  and combined ratio 
the loss ratio is the result of dividing claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is the result of dividing underwriting expenses acquisition costs and operational expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the table below sets forth our net premiums earned  claims and claim expenses and underwriting expenses by segment and their corresponding claims  underwriting expense and combined ratios years ended december  in thousands reinsurance net earned premiums property catastrophe    reinsurance net earned premiums specialty    total reinsurance net earned premiums    individual risk net earned premiums    total net earned premiums    reinsurance claims and claim expenses    individual risk claims and claim expenses    total claims and claim expenses    reinsurance underwriting expenses    individual risk underwriting expenses    total underwriting expenses    reinsurance net underwriting income    individual risk net underwriting income loss    total net underwriting income    reinsurance claims and claim expenses ratio individual risk claims and claim expenses ratio total claims and claim expenses ratio reinsurance underwriting expenses ratio individual risk underwriting expenses ratio total underwriting expenses ratio reinsurance combined ratio individual risk combined ratio total combined ratio the increase in our net underwriting income from our reinsurance segment was primarily the result of three factors the low level of property catastrophe losses during  the increase in our net reinsurance premiums earned during  as a result of our increase in gross written property catastrophe premiums and specialty reinsurance premiums see premiums above  and the inception of davinci s operations during losses from our property catastrophe reinsurance policies can be infrequent  but severe  however  during periods with benign property catastrophe loss activity  such as  we have the potential to produce an unusually low level of losses and a related increase in underwriting income 
although this occurred during  there can be no guarantee that this reduced level of losses will continue in or beyond 
also during  as discussed in the premiums section above  we significantly increased our specialty reinsurance premiums written 
although specialty reinsurance premiums will normally produce higher claims and claim expenses than the property catastrophe reinsurance business  the reduction in our losses resulting from the low level of catastrophe losses during more than offset the increased normal loss activity arising from our specialty reinsurance premiums 
the increase in our net underwriting income from our individual risk segment was primarily the result of the growth in premiums in compared with see premiums above  and a reduction of the proportion of this business that was ceded to third parties 
our claims and claim expenses also benefited from our purchase of reinsurance protection as we recorded reinsurance recoveries of million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
although there can be no assurance that our net claims and claim expenses will continue to benefit from the purchase of reinsurance  we will continue to seek to purchase reinsurance protection to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available 
our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition costs and operational expenses 
acquisition costs consist of costs to acquire premiums and are principally comprised of broker commissions and excise taxes 
acquisition costs are driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums 
operational expenses consist of salaries and other general and administrative expenses 
our reinsurance business operates with a limited number of employees and we are able to grow our written premiums without proportionally increasing our operating costs 
as our premiums increase  we expect that our operating costs will tend to increase to a lesser extent and since our acquisition costs are based on a percentage of the premiums earned  these costs will fluctuate in line with the fluctuation in premiums 
therefore  in total  as our premiums increase  we would expect that our expense ratio would decrease  as was the case in and recently  we have entered into joint ventures and specialized quota share cessions of our book of business 
in accordance with the joint venture and quota share agreements  we are entitled to certain fee income and profit commissions 
we record these fees and profit commissions as a reduction in acquisition costs or operating expenses and accordingly these fees have also contributed to the reduction in our expense ratio 
although industry wide insurance losses were the highest in history during  we recorded increases in net underwriting profit  cash flows from operations  earnings per share and book value per share 
we attribute our performance to our disciplined underwriting approach  the experience of our underwriters  and the advantage afforded by our sophisticated risk models 
during and  the majority of the premiums written in the individual risk segment were ceded to other reinsurers and as a result  net earned premiums from the individual risk operations were relatively minor 
based on this reduced level of net earned premiums  relatively modest increases or decreases to net written premiums  claims and claim expenses incurred  acquisition costs or operating expenses can cause  and did cause  unusual fluctuations in the claims and claim expenses ratio and the underwriting expense ratio of such individual risk operations 
net investment income year ended december  in thousands    because a majority of our coverages provide protection from damages resulting from natural and man made catastrophes  it is possible that we could become liable for a significant amount of losses on short term notice 
accordingly we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains investments in marketable fixed income securities  such as us government bonds  corporate bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
as a result of the declining interest rate environment during  the average yield on our portfolio fell to as of december  from as of december  as yields on our portfolio decrease  our interest income will also decrease 
however  the decline in interest rates during was offset by our significant growth in invested assets during the year  which was primarily due to our strong cash flows from operations 
also  in the latter half of  we raised a net million from financing activities  which was available to us for investment purposes for the full year of see financial condition capital resources 
during  as a result of the declining interest rate environment  the average yield on our portfolio fell from as of december  to as of december   which caused a reduction in our investment income 
the decline in our investment income during to million from million during would have been greater  except that offsetting the impact of the decreased yields were our strong cash flows from operations of million and our capital raising activities in the latter half of  as noted above 
other income year ended december  in thousands cat business fee income    cat business equity earnings top layer re    other items    total    as discussed previously  in we began to manage property catastrophe books of business for the top layer re and opcat joint ventures and in return for managing these joint ventures  we receive fees  profit commissions and or an equity participation in these ventures 
during  our fee income decreased primarily as a result of the reduced level of fees received from opcat  as a result of the decision by opcat s parent company  overseas partners limited  to exit the reinsurance business 
during our equity earnings from top layer re increased as a result of the increase in premiums written by top layer re and the resultant increase in top layer re s net income 
the balance of the other items in other income increased primarily due to profits of million on derivative instruments under which losses or recoveries are triggered by an industry loss index or geological or physical variables a loss of million 
during  we formed davinci  in which we currently own of the outstanding equity 
however  we own a majority of davinci s outstanding voting rights and its results are consolidated in our financial statements 
accordingly  our income from this joint venture is not reflected in other income  rather  our profit participation and equity participation in davinci are recorded primarily through underwriting income and investment income  partially offset by an increase in minority interest for the of davinci owned by third parties 
also  as discussed in ceded premiums  we have entered into certain placements of structured quota share reinsurance agreements for participations in our property catastrophe book of business 
in accordance with these agreements we retain fees and have the right to receive profit commissions associated with these cessions 
we record these fees and profit commissions as a reduction in acquisition costs and operating expenses 
if we were to record davinci on the equity method of accounting  and if we were to record our fees from the quota share relationships in other income  our pro forma other income from all of these relationships would be as follows year ended december  in thousands cat business fee income    cat business equity earnings top layer re  davinci    other items    total    corporate expenses year ended december  in thousands    corporate expenses incurred include expenses related to legal and certain consulting expenses  costs for research and development  and other miscellaneous costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
the increase in corporate expenses during primarily related to an increase in legal costs of million and costs of million related to accelerated vesting of equity compensation 
the majority of the increase in corporate expenses in primarily related to costs related to research and development initiatives conducted by us in interest and preferred share dividends year ended december  in thousands interest revolving credit facilities    interest million senior notes   dividends million capital securities    dividends million series a preference shares   total interest and preferred share dividends    our interest payments and preferred dividends increased during  primarily as a result of the timing of our capital raising activities  which occurred in the latter half of accordingly  during  the balance of the senior notes and the series a preference shares were outstanding for the entire year  and we incurred a full year of charges related to these securities as compared to a partial year of charges during in january and february of  we raised an additional million from the issuance of million in senior notes and million in series b preference shares  respectively  and as a result we expect our interest and preferred share dividends to increase during as compared with income tax expense benefit year ended december  in thousands   during we chose to write a limited amount of business in our us operations  and  therefore  our us net income was minimal and the related tax impact for was also minimal during and  we also had little or no net income in the us  however  as of december  we had accumulated a million deferred tax asset 
as a result of the limited number of attractive opportunities in the us primary insurance market  our us insurance operations did not generate taxable income during those years  which called into question the recoverability of the million deferred tax asset 
although we retain the benefit of this asset through  during  and we decided to increase our valuation allowance by million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the gross and net balance of the deferred tax asset was million and million  respectively 
we currently plan to increase the business written by our us insurance subsidiaries 
if  as a result  our us operations begin to generate taxable income  the appropriateness of the valuation allowance will be reassessed and  accordingly  any potential profits from our us operations would possibly not have a corresponding offset for tax expenses  up to the million valuation allowance recorded as of december  realized gains losses year ended december  in thousands    because our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  a large majority of our investments are in the fixed income markets and  therefore  our realized holding gains and losses on investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
therefore as interest rates decline  as occurred in and  we will tend to have realized gains from the turnover of our investment portfolio  and as interest rates increase  as was the case in  we will tend to have realized losses from the turnover of our investment portfolio  although such correlation for realized gains losses on sales of investments can be reduced depending on which specific securities we choose to sell 
the amount of the realized gains or realized losses that will be recorded in the future will be dependent upon the level of our investments  the changes in the interest rate environment and how quickly or slowly we choose to turn over our investment portfolio 
a larger investment portfolio  greater fluctuations in the interest rate environment  and turning over an investment portfolio quickly  will affect the magnitude of realized gains or realized losses 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle goodwill effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  the company completed its initial impairment review in compliance with the transition provisions of sfas and  as a result  the company decided to record goodwill at zero value  the low end of an estimated range of values  and wrote off the balance of its goodwill during the second quarter of  which totaled million 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  this is required to be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income and is required to be recorded retroactive to january  financial condition renaissancere is a holding company  and we therefore rely on dividends from our subsidiaries and investment income to make principal and interest and dividend payments on our debt and capital securities  and to make dividend payments to our preference shareholders and common shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our bermuda subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under us statutory regulations and bermuda insurance law  which require our bermuda insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries was  million  and the amount of capital and surplus required to be maintained was million 
our us subsidiaries are also required to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our us subsidiaries was million and the amount of capital and surplus required to be maintained was million 
during  renaissance reinsurance and davinci declared aggregate cash dividends to us of million and million  respectively  compared with million and million  respectively  in our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their own expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide sufficient liquidity to meet extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
additionally  we maintain a million credit facility to meet additional capital requirements  if necessary 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities for were million  which principally consisted of net income of million  plus million for increases to net reserves for claims and claim expenses  plus million for increases in reserves for unearned premiums 
our cash flows from operations were primarily utilized to invest in fixed income securities 
we have generated cash flows from operations in  and significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
to the extent that capital is not utilized in our reinsurance or individual risk segments  we will consider using such capital to invest in new opportunities 
because a large portion of the coverages we provide typically can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
reserves for claims and claims expenses as discussed in the summary of critical accounting policies and estimates  for insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the claims and claim expense reserves 
because of the variability and uncertainty associated with loss estimation  we believe that our ultimate payments will vary  possibly materially  from our initial estimate of reserves 
a large portion of our coverages provide protection from natural and man made catastrophes which are generally infrequent  but can be significant  such as losses from hurricanes and earthquakes 
because loss events to which we are exposed can be characterized by low frequency but high severity  our claims and claim expense reserves will normally fluctuate  sometimes materially  based upon the occurrence of a significant natural or man made catastrophic loss for which we provide reinsurance 
our claims reserves will also fluctuate based on the payments we make for these large loss events 
the timing of our payments on loss events can be affected by the event causing the loss  the location of the loss  and whether our losses are from policies with insurers or reinsurers 
during we increased our specialty reinsurance and individual risk gross written premiums see premiums 
the addition of these lines of business adds additional uncertainty to our claims reserving process and our claims reserve estimates as the reporting of information  the setting of initial reserves and the loss settlement process for these lines of business vary from our traditional property catastrophe line of business 
for our reinsurance and individual risk operations  our estimates of claims reserves include case reserves reported to us as well as our estimate of losses incurred but not reported ibnr to us 
our case reserve and our estimates for ibnr reserves are based on claims reports from insureds  our underwriters experience in setting claims reserves  the use of computer models where applicable and historical industry claims experience 
where necessary we will also use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate ultimate expected claims and claim expenses 
we review our claims reserves on a regular basis 
as of december   and  included in our claims and claim expense reserves were ibnr reserves of million  million and million  respectively 
capital resources our total capital resources at december  and were as follows years ended december  in thousands common shareholders equity   series a preference shares   total shareholders equity   senior notes   capital securities   davinci revolving credit facility borrowed  revolving credit facility unborrowed   revolving credit facility borrowed term and revolving loan facility   total capital resources   during  our capital resources increased primarily as a result of three items our net income of million  an increase in unrealized gains on our investment portfolio to million million as of december   million of which related to our investment in platinum see investments  and the borrowing of the full million available under davinci s revolving credit facility 
on april   davinci entered into a credit agreement providing for a million committed revolving credit facility 
on may   davinci borrowed the full million available under this facility to repay million of bridge financing provided by renaissancere 
neither renaissancere nor renaissance reinsurance is a guarantor of this facility and the lenders have no recourse against us or our subsidiaries other than davinci under this facility 
pursuant to the terms of the million facility maintained by renaissancere  a default by davinci in its obligations will not result in a default under the renaissancere facility 
although we own a minority of the economic interest of davinci  we control a majority of its outstanding voting rights and  accordingly  davinci is consolidated in our financial statements  as a result  the replacement of million of debt from renaissancere with million of debt from a third party has caused our reported consolidated debt to increase by million 
as of december   the full amount was outstanding under this facility 
interest rates on the facility are based on a spread above libor  and averaged approximately during the credit agreement contains certain covenants requiring davinci to maintain a debt to capital ratio of or below and a minimum net worth of million 
as at december   davinci was in compliance with the covenants of this agreement 
with the increased opportunities to grow our business  we also decided to materially increase our capital resources through the following activities in october  we issued million common shares for net proceeds of million 
in november  we raised million in net proceeds through the issuance of  par value series a preference shares at per share 
the shares are non convertible and may be redeemed at per share on or after november  dividends are cumulative from the date of original issuance and are payable quarterly in arrears at when  if  and as  declared by our board of directors 
under certain circumstances  such as amalgamations and changes to bermuda law requiring approval of the holders of our preference shares to vote as a single class  we may redeem the shares prior to november  at per share 
the preference shares have no stated maturity and are not convertible into any of our other securities 
in july we issued million of senior notes due july we used a portion of the proceeds to repay million of outstanding amounts under our million revolving credit and term loan agreement 
we can redeem the notes prior to maturity subject to payment of a make whole premium  however  we currently have no intentions of calling the notes 
the notes  which are senior obligations  pay interest semi annually and contain various covenants  including limitations on mergers and consolidations  restriction as to the disposition of stock of designated subsidiaries and limitations on liens on the stock of designated subsidiaries 
in october we formed davinci  and raised million of outside capital million as of december  
we also utilized million of our own capital in the formation of davinci when we contributed million as equity and provided million as bridge financing 
the bridge financing was repaid in may when davinci entered into a revolving credit facility  as noted above 
also  in conjunction with market opportunities  as of december  we increased the capital of renaissance reinsurance to billion and increased the capital of glencoe to million 
we maintain a revolving credit and term loan agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks 
there was no outstanding balance as of december  and during the third quarter of  we repaid our borrowings of million on this facility 
interest rates on the facility are based on a spread above libor and averaged during if we were to borrow under this agreement  the agreement contains certain financial covenants including requirements that consolidated debt to capital does not exceed a ratio of  consolidated net worth must exceed the greater of million or of consolidated debt  and of invested assets must be rated bbb by s p or baa by moody s investor service or better 
our subsidiary  renaissance us holdings renaissance us  has a million term loan and million revolving loan facility with a syndicate of commercial banks 
interest rates on the facility are based upon a spread above libor  and averaged during  compared to during the related agreements contain certain financial covenants  including a covenant that renaissancere  as principal guarantor  maintain a ratio of liquid assets to debt service of the term loan and revolving credit facility has a mandatory repayment provision of million in june during  renaissance us repaid the third installment of million in accordance with the terms of the loan 
renaissance us was in compliance with all the covenants of this term loan and revolving loan facility as at december  our subsidiary  renaissancere capital trust has issued capital securities which pay cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of  payable semi annually 
during  renaissancere repurchased million of the capital securities 
no capital securities were repurchased in renaissancere has repurchased an aggregate million of the capital securities since their issuance in the sole asset of the trust consists of our junior subordinated debentures in an amount equal to the outstanding capital securities 
the indenture relating to these junior subordinated debentures contains certain covenants  including a covenant prohibiting us from the payment of dividends if we are in default under the indenture 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture at december  the capital trust securities mature on march  generally accepted accounting principles do not allow these securities to be classified as a component of shareholders equity  therefore  they are recorded as minority interest 
under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  we may be required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit aggregating million  compared to million in also  in connection with our top layer re joint venture we have committed million of collateral to support a letter of credit 
our principal facility is a million secured facility which accepts as collateral shares issued by our subsidiary renaissance investment holdings ltd  or rihl 
our participating operating subsidiaries and our managed joint ventures have pledged and must maintain rihl shares issued to it with a sufficient collateral value to support their respective obligations under the facility  including reimbursement obligations for outstanding letters of credit 
the participating subsidiaries also have the option to post alternative forms of collateral 
in addition  each participating subsidiary and joint venture must maintain additional unpledged rihl shares at least equal to of its facility usage  and in the aggregate total unpledged rihl shares must be maintained at least equal to of all of the outstanding rihl shares  for liquidity purposes  in addition to those pledged to support the facility 
in the case of a default under the facility  or in other circumstances in which the rights of our lenders to collect on their collateral may be impaired  the lenders are granted broad enforcement powers under the facility agreements  in accordance with and subject to its terms 
upon the occurance of certain events including events of default specified in the facility  the collateral agent acting on behalf of the lenders is permitted to redeem pledged shares and convert the collateral into cash or eligible marketable securities 
the redemption of shares by the collateral agent takes priority over any pending redemption of unpledged shares by us or other holders 
in order to encourage employee ownership of common shares  we have guaranteed certain loan and pledge agreements between certain employees and bank of america  illinois bofa 
pursuant to the terms of this employee credit facility  bofa has agreed to loan the participating employees up to an aggregate of million 
the balance outstanding at december  was million  compared to million in each loan under this employee credit facility is required to be initially collateralized by the respective participating employee with common shares or other collateral acceptable to bofa 
if the value of the collateral provided by a participating employee subsequently decreases  the participating employee is required to contribute additional collateral in the amount of such deficiency  failing which bofa can accelerate the loan and liquidate the remaining collateral 
loans under this employee credit facility are otherwise non recourse to the participating employees 
given the level of collateral  we do not presently anticipate that we will be required to honor any guarantees under the employee credit facility  although there can be no assurance that we will not be so required in the future 
no further loans or draws will be made under this facility 
we anticipate the repayment of these loans and the subsequent closure of this facility prior to december  in january  we issued million of senior notes due february  the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes 
interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year  commencing august  the notes can be redeemed by us prior to maturity subject to payment of a make whole premium  however  we have no current intentions of calling the notes 
the notes  which are senior obligations  contain various covenants  including limitations on mergers and consolidations  restriction as to the disposition of stock of designated subsidiaries and limitations on liens on the stock of designated subsidiaries 
in february  we issued  series b preference shares at per share 
the shares may be redeemed at per share at our option on or after february  dividends are cumulative from the date of original issuance and are payable quarterly in arrears at  commencing june  when  if  and as declared by the board of directors 
if we submit a proposal to our shareholders concerning an amalgamation or submit any proposal that  as a result of any changes to bermuda law  requires approval of the holders of our preference shares to vote as a single class  we may redeem the shares prior to february  at per share 
the preference shares have no stated maturity and are not convertible into any other of our securities 
shareholders equity during  shareholders equity increased by million to billion as of december   from billion as of december  the significant components of the change in shareholders equity included net income from continuing operations of million and an increase in our unrealized gains on investments available for sale of million  offset by dividends to common and preference shareholders of million 
from time to time  we have returned capital to our shareholders through share repurchase programs 
the value of the remaining shares authorized under the repurchase programs is million 
no shares were repurchased during or in the future  we may purchase shares under our current authorization  or increase the size of our program 
any such determination will be subject to market conditions and numerous other factors 
under bermuda law  renaissancere common shares repurchased are normally cancelled and retired 
investments at december   we held cash and investments totaling billion  compared to billion in the table below shows the aggregate amounts of our invested assets years ended december  in thousands fixed maturities available for sale  at fair value    short term investments  at cost   other investments    equity investments in reinsurance company  at fair value  cash and cash equivalents    total    the million growth in our portfolio of invested assets for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net cash provided by operating activities of million  an addition of million in debt by davinci and the increase in the net unrealized appreciation on the available for sale investment portfolio of million 
the equity investment in reinsurance company relates to our november  purchase of  common shares of platinum underwriters holdings  ltd 
platinum in a private placement transaction 
in addition  we received a ten year warrant to purchase up to million additional common shares of platinum for per share 
we purchased the common shares for an aggregate price of million 
as at december   we own of platinum s outstanding common shares 
we have recorded our investment in platinum at fair value  and at december  the aggregate fair value was million 
the aggregate unrealized gain of million on the platinum investment is included in accumulated other comprehensive income  of which million represents our estimate of the value of the warrants 
because we primarily provide coverage for damages resulting from natural and man made catastrophes  we may become liable for substantial claim payments on short term notice 
accordingly  our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide a high level of liquidity which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains investments in fixed income securities  such as us government bonds  corporate bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
alternative investments included in other investments are investments in hedge funds and a fund invested in bank loans of million million and private equity funds of million million collectively investment funds 
fair values for our investments in such investment funds are established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investment funds 
these net valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investment funds 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares of the investment funds 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on investment funds are included as a component of net investment income 
we have committed capital to private equity funds of million  of which million has been contributed as at december  our current investment guidelines call for the invested asset portfolio  which includes investments available for sale and short term investments  to have at least an average aa rating as measured by standard poor s ratings group 
at december   our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa  an average duration of years and an average yield to maturity of 
catastrophe linked instruments we have assumed risk through catastrophe and derivative instruments under which losses could be triggered by an industry loss index or geological or physical variables 
during  and we recorded income or recoveries on non indemnity catastrophe index transactions of million  a loss of million and nil  respectively 
we report these recoveries in other income 
we cannot provide assurances that this performance will continue 
market sensitive instruments our investment portfolio includes investments whose market values will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in total return of  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million at december  at december   the decrease in total return would have been  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million 
the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
currency our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience exchange gains and losses and incur underwriting losses in currencies other than us dollars  which will in turn affect our consolidated financial statements 
our current foreign currency policy is to hold foreign currency assets  including cash and receivables  that approximate the net monetary foreign currency liabilities  including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
all changes in the exchange rates are recognized currently in our statement of income 
when necessary we will seek to hedge our exposure to foreign currency transactions through the use of options  swaps and or forward contracts 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding options  swaps or forward contracts related to foreign currency exposure 
effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
off balance sheet and special purpose entity arrangements as of december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of regulation s k 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
see results of operations cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle goodwill  above 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas and provides transitional disclosure requirements 
for the years ended december  and for the prior years  the company followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock compensation 
effective january   the company adopted  prospectively  the fair value recognition provisions of sfas for all stock based employee compensation granted  modified or settled after january  under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  the company estimates the fair value of employee stock options and other stock based compensation on the date of grant and amortizes this value as an expense over the vesting period 
in accordance with the transitional disclosure provisions of sfas  the following table sets out the effect on the company s net income and earnings per share for all reported periods had the compensation cost been calculated based upon the fair value method recommended in sfas year ended december  in thousands of us dollars except share and per share data net income  as reported    add stock based employee compensation cost included in determination of net income    less fair value compensation cost under sfas    pro forma net income    earnings per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma current outlook we believe that there has been a significant dislocation in the insurance and reinsurance markets  due primarily to o the increase in demand for insurance and reinsurance protection  and the withdrawal in supply  as a result of the substantial losses stemming from the world trade center disaster  o substantial increases in prior years loss reserves stemming from asbestos related claims and an increase in losses from other casualty coverages written in the late s and  and o significant reductions in shareholders equity of many insurance and reinsurance companies due to the decline in the global equity markets 
based on the factors above  the financial strength ratings of various insurance and reinsurance companies were reduced during late and during because of these and other factors  we believe that the property catastrophe reinsurance market  the specialty reinsurance market  and the individual risk markets in which we participate  will continue to display strong fundamentals and will provide us with growth opportunities during also  because we experienced relatively limited net losses from the world trade center disaster and the other events noted above  we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of these and other potential opportunities during subsequent to the world trade center disaster  a substantial amount of capital entered the insurance and reinsurance markets both through investments in established companies and through start up ventures 
currently  we do not believe that the new capital has offset the widespread underwriting and investment losses sufficiently to cause significant adverse changes to the prevailing pricing structure in the property catastrophe reinsurance market 
however  it is possible that the new capital in the market  an environment with continued light catastrophe losses  or other factors could cause a reduction in prices of our products 
to the extent that industry pricing of our products does not meet our hurdle rate  we would plan to reduce our future underwriting activities thus resulting in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected earnings from this portion of our business 
the growth in our premiums from the specialty reinsurance and individual risk markets presents us with added operational and management risks for which our historical experience is limited 
accordingly  we plan to continue to expand and enhance our underwriting  risk management and operational capabilities in our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations to help control the risks associated with these businesses 
we also believe that some of our future opportunities may arise in other lines of business in which we have limited experience  such as certain casualty coverages 
if these opportunities come to fruition  they will present us with additional management and operational risks for which we would need to further develop our resources 
the world trade center disaster has caused insurers and reinsurers to seek to limit their potential exposures to losses from terrorism attacks 
we often exclude losses from terrorism in the reinsurance coverages that we write  however  we have offered specific coverage for certain terrorism or terrorism related events and  accordingly  we do have potential exposures to this risk 
also  our subsidiary  glencoe insurance ltd  in accordance with recently passed legislation in the united states  is required to offer terrorism insurance to the majority of its customers 
currently the take up rate by glencoe s customers has approximated  however  we can not be certain on what the future take up rates by glencoe s clients will be 
we continue to monitor our aggregate exposure to terrorist attacks 
the cost of our reinsurance protection may increase during if prices rise to levels at which we believe the purchase of reinsurance protection would become uneconomical  we may retain a greater level of net risk in certain geographic regions or for certain classes of risk 
however  depending on market conditions  it is also possible that we will have increased opportunities to purchase reinsurance  resulting in increased levels of ceded premium 
in order to obtain longer term retrocessional capacity  we have entered into multi year contracts with respect to a portion of our portfolio 
we have also begun to enter into quota share type reinsurance relationships from which we generate fees and profit commissions
