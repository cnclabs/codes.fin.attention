critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to real estate and development assets  revenue recognition in conjunction with providing development  leasing and management services and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
a summary of our accounting policies and procedures are included in footnote of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we believe the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgment of estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
real estate and development assets costs related to the acquisition  predevelopment  development  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized 
interest  real estate taxes  insurance and other development related costs including certain direct and indirect costs incurred during the construction period are also capitalized 
upon completion of development all such costs are depreciated over the life of the related assets 
costs incurred during predevelopment are capitalized after we have identified and secured a site  determined that a project is feasible  and concluded that it is probable that the project will proceed 
the mills lp has invested significant amounts of capital in several predevelopment projects 
while we believe we will recover this capital through the successful development of such projects  or through other alternative opportunities and courses of action in the event that such development cannot proceed  it is possible that a significant write off of unrecoverable amounts could occur 
a material write off could impact the financial condition of the mills lp  including its ability to comply with certain covenant tests under our various debt agreements 
a material write off could also impact our ability to obtain funding for future development projects 
we are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and will not be successful in all cases 
costs incurred related to these acquisition opportunities are expensed when it becomes probable that we will not be successful in the acquisition 
income producing properties are individually evaluated for impairment when various conditions exist that may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from a property is less than its historical net cost basis 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of historical cost basis over fair value 
revenue recognition we  as lessor  have retained substantially all the risks and benefits of property ownership and we account for our leases as operating leases 
minimum rent from income producing properties is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
percentage rent is recognized when tenants sales have reached certain levels specified in the respective leases 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
msc has entered into agreements with the joint ventures to provide management  leasing  development and financial services for the joint venture properties 
for management services  msc is entitled to a percentage of rental revenues received by the joint venture property 
for leasing services  msc is entitled to an agreed upon rate monthly per square foot of space leased that is recognized upon execution of a lease 
for development services  msc is entitled to an agreed upon fee that is deferred during the predevelopment stage of the project and subsequently recognized ratably during the development period once a development agreement is executed 
for financial services  msc receives an agreed upon percentage of the total loan commitment that is recognized when a construction loan or permanent loan is executed by the lender 
costs incurred to provide leasing  development and financial services are capitalized when incurred and subsequently expensed as the fee is earned 
other fee income from affiliated joint ventures reflects the fees earned from providing leasing  development and financing services  net of the estimated costs incurred to provide these services 
investment in unconsolidated joint ventures we do not consider ourselves to be in control of joint ventures when major business decisions require the approval of at least one other general partner 
accordingly  we account for our joint ventures under the equity method 
we calculate the equity in income or loss earned from our unconsolidated joint ventures based on our estimate of each partner s economic ownership which is estimated based on anticipated stabilized cashflows as they would be distributed to each partner 
generally  under the terms of the respective partnership agreements  net ordinary cashflow is distributed to each partner first to pay preferences on unreturned capital balances including cumulative unpaid preferences and thereafter in accordance with residual sharing percentages as defined in the partnership agreement 
cashflow from capital events including refinancing and asset sales is allocated first to partners in an amount equal to their unreturned capital account and thereafter in accordance with residual sharing percentages 
foreign operations the us dollar is the functional currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the united states 
the functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating outside of the united states is the local currency of the country in which the entity is located 
our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar translate their financial statements into us dollars 
assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date 
income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
income statement accounts that represent significant  non recurring transactions are translated at the rate in effect as of the date of the transaction 
gains and losses resulting from the translation are immaterial 
we translate our share of the income of its unconsolidated entities when the functional currency is not the us dollar at the average exchange rate for the period 
we and our foreign entities have certain transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
in these instances  nonmonetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate  monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period  and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from remeasurement are included in our results of operations 
our foreign currency gain  net totaling  arises primarily from the remeasurement of intercompany advances to unconsolidated joint ventures 
in addition  gains or losses are recorded in the income statement when a transaction with a third party  denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated

other property revenues for the year ended december  decreased million as compared with the year ended december  the decrease relates to the recognition of lease termination income of million from one tenant at four joint venture properties in excluding the significant amount of termination income received from that tenant  other property revenues increased million due to a full year of operations for arundel mills and opry mills and the opening of discover mills 
the three new properties contributed million of the increase 
additionally  termination income at existing centers due to a more aggressive policy for underperforming tenants and an increase in rental income from temporary tenants due to lower occupancy contributed to the increase 
recoverable from tenants for the year ended december  increased million as compared with the year ended december   due primarily to the opening of discover mills in and the opening of arundel mills and opry mills in november and may  respectively  which contributed million of the increase 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared with the year ended december   due primarily to a full year of operations for arundel mills and opry mills and the opening of discover mills which contributed million of the increase 
additionally  bad debts and related legal costs increased due to an increase in tenant bankruptcies in interest income for the year ended december  decreased million as compared with the year ended december  due primarily to the collection of note receivable balances at several properties 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million as compared with the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is due primarily to placing arundel mills and opry mills into service in late  contributing million of the increase 
additionally  interest expense was higher at ontario mills and grapevine mills due to the fourth quarter financing of expansions at these centers 
these increases were partially offset by lower interest rates on variable rate debt as a result of a decline in the libor rate in cash flows net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from increased operational income and improved collections of accounts receivable  partially offset by the timing of repayments of accrued expenses 
net cash flow used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase is due to increased development expenditures and contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the development of colorado mills  madrid xanad and st 
louis mills  in addition to increased predevelopment expenditures for vaughan mills  meadowlands xanadu  san francisco piers and various other projects in the predevelopment stage 
cash used in investing activities also increased due to the acquisitions  including the acquisition of the remaining interest in opry mills that we did not already own million  the acquisition of of simon s joint venture interest in arizona mills and of simon s joint venture interest in arundel mills  concord mills  grapevine mills and ontario mills million  the acquisition of forest fair mall in cincinnati  ohio million  the acquisition of riverside square in hackensack  new jersey million and a deposit of million for the acquisition of five properties owned by cadillac fairview 
these increases were partially offset by increased distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures due to increased operating cash flows 
net cash flow provided by financing activities increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to secondary public offerings of common stock in february  may and december  which raised net proceeds of million as compared with the august common stock offering which raised million 
additionally  during  we issued series b and series c cumulative preferred stock which raised net proceeds of million as compared to the series a cumulative convertible preferred stock reissued in which raised net proceeds of million 
also contributing to the increase in financing activities was the refinancing of the debt on opry mills  reduced refinancing costs and a decrease in restricted cash  partially offset by repayments of our corporate revolving loan and higher dividends as a result of our equity offerings

we originally planned to develop a mixed use development to be known as meadowlands mills on the empire tract 
meadowlands mills would consist of million square feet of gla  plus office and hotel space 
the project would be developed on an entitled site of acres  plus roads and retention facilities 
assuming the completion of a successful development agreement with the new jersey sports exposition authority  we will convey the empire tract to the state of new jersey

in addition  in italy  our efforts are concentrated on several well located sites in milan  suburban florence and rome 
additional factors seasonality 
the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales peaking in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season 
as a result  a substantial portion of percentage rent is not paid until the fourth quarter 
furthermore  most new lease up occurs towards the later part of the year in anticipation of the holiday season and most vacancies occur toward the beginning of the year 
in addition  the majority of temporary tenants take occupancy in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  cash flow and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality also impacts the quarter by quarter results of net operating income and funds from operations  although this impact is largely mitigated by recognizing minimum rent on a straight line basis over the term of related leases in accordance with gaap 
environmental matters 
we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances

moreover  no assurances can be given that a future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or b the current environmental condition of our properties have not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of our properties  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties or by third parties unrelated to us 
limited quantities of asbestos containing materials are present in certain of our properties 
the asbestos containing materials found are generally non friable meaning that the asbestos containing materials are not easily crumbled and thus are less likely to release asbestos fibers into the air  in good condition and are unlikely to be disturbed

prior to removal  these asbestos containing materials will be monitored and maintained by us in accordance with procedures established by the environmental protection agency  the occupational safety and health administration and other applicable governmental authorities

the mills corporation unaudited item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments derivatives and hedging in the normal course of business  we and our joint ventures are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes and foreign currency exchange rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition or cash flow 
we and the joint ventures limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
we and the joint ventures do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we and the joint ventures require that the hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing interest rate risk exposure 
this effectiveness is essential for qualifying for hedge accounting 
changes in the hedging instrument s fair value related to the effective portion of the risk being hedged are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in those cases  hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs 
hedges that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as cash flow hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is marked to market with the change included in net income in each period until the derivative instrument matures 
additionally  any derivative instrument used for risk management that becomes ineffective is marked to market 
to manage interest rate risk  we and the joint ventures may employ interest rate swaps  caps and floors  options  forwards or a combination thereof  depending on an underlying exposure 
interest rate swaps and collars are contractual agreements between us or the joint ventures and third parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments periodically without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts notional amounts 
in the unlikely event that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of an interest rate swap contract or collar agreement  our exposure is limited to the interest rate differential on the notional amount 
we do not anticipate non performance by any of our counterparties 
net interest differentials to be paid or received under a swap contract and or collar agreement are included in interest expense as incurred or earned 
interest rate hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges hedge the future cash outflows on debt 
interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments  interest rate caps  floors  collars and forwards are cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet and included in accounts payable and other liabilities or in investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for joint venture hedges with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or in earnings depending on the hedging relationship 
if the hedging transaction is a cash flow hedge  then the offsetting gains losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
over time  the unrealized gains losses held in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be recognized in earnings consistent with when the hedged items are recognized in earnings 
in conjunction with our policy to reduce interest rate risk  we and our unconsolidated joint ventures have entered into the interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of monthly cash outflows attributable to changes in libor 
under the swaps  we receive libor based payments and pay a fixed rate 
a summary of the terms of the derivative instruments  as of december   a reconciliation of the fair value and adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss in thousands are as follows wholly owned joint ventures hedge type cash flow cash flow description swap swap range of notional amounts     range of interest rates effective start dates range of maturity dates total accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  change in fair value for the year ended december   total accumulated other comprehensive loss at december   the opry mills joint venture acquired a construction loan in september in conjunction with this financing  opry mills entered into a collar agreement that effectively fixed libor within a range from to on a notional amount of million maturing in september in june  the opry mills joint venture terminated the collar  but the debt for which the hedge was designated remained outstanding as a result of our acquisition of gaylord s interest in opry mills subsequent to the termination of the collar agreement 
our share of the cost to terminate the hedge totaling million was deferred and amortized as interest expense through september  the original maturity date of the hedge 
the joint venture partner s share of the collar termination was million 
the collar s accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  was million and was reduced to zero at september  as a result of the termination and the effect of the passage of time on the fair value of the collar 
the estimated fair value of our financial instruments has been determined by us  using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
for purposes of the securities and exchange commission s market risk disclosure requirements  we have estimated the fair value of our financial instruments at december  the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts  as of december   future estimates of fair value and the amounts which may be paid or realized in the future may differ significantly from amounts presented below 
the following table provides information about our consolidated financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  for consolidated debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows in thousands and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates  including the effect of an interest rate swap currently in effect 
thereafter total estimated fair value fixed rate mortgages  notes and loans payable   average interest rate variable rate mortgages  notes and loans payable   average interest rate foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign exchange risk related to our foreign joint venture investment balance that is denominated in the foreign currency of the investment and thus requires re measurement into the us dollar 
the exposure to foreign exchange risk related to translating the income and expenses of its equity investments is minimal due to the fact that most transactions occur in the functional currency of that entity and the investments are not yet operational 
we currently have not hedged this foreign joint venture investment balance  accordingly  a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in an approximate million us dollar impact to income before minority interest for the fiscal year ended december
