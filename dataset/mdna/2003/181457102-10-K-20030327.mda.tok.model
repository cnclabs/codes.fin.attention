item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tables shown in thousands of dollars  except per share amounts the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto and other information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and the results of operations  and which require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue sources and recognition our operating segments derive their revenue primarily from o commissions paid by the insurance companies issuing the policies underlying our clients benefit programs  o program design and administrative service fees paid by our clients  o executive compensation and benefit and related consulting fees  and o fees for legislative liaison and related advisory services 
our commission revenue is normally recurring  is typically paid annually and usually extends for a period of ten years or more after the sale 
commissions are paid by insurance companies and vary by policy and by program and typically represent a percentage of the premium or the cash surrender value of the insurance policies underlying the program 
first year commission revenue and related fees 
first year commission revenue and related fees are derived from two principal sources a the commission we earn when the client first purchases the policies  which revenue is recognized at the time the application is substantially completed  the client is contractually committed to purchase the insurance policies and the premiums are paid  by the client  to the insurance company  and b fees for the services related to the enrollment and initial administration of the benefit programs and underlying policies 
our first year commission revenue is frequently subject to chargeback  which means that insurance companies retain the right to recover commissions paid in the event policies prematurely terminate 
the chargeback schedules differ by product and usually apply to first year commission only 
a typical chargeback schedule  based on a percent of first year commission  is as follows year years and year years and beyond while the commission revenue is subject to chargeback  our experience has indicated that less than of revenue recognized has ever been refunded to insurance companies pursuant to such chargeback provisions 
given the homogenous nature of such cases and historical information about chargebacks  we believe we are able to accurately estimate the revenue earned 
we currently maintain a chargeback allowance  which is monitored on a quarterly basis for adequacy 
renewal commission revenue and related fees 
renewal commission revenue is the commission we earn on the policies underlying the benefit programs we have sold in prior years 
renewal revenue is recognized on the date that the renewal premium is due or paid by the client to the insurance company depending on the type of policy 
consulting fee revenue 
consulting fee revenue consists of fees of human capital practice  pearl meyer and federal policy group for the services we perform in advising our clients on their executive compensation programs and related consulting services  retirement  benefit  actuarial  pension savings plan design and management  people strategy  compensation surveys  institutional registered investment advisory services and fees from legislative and regulatory policy matters 
these fees are generally based on a rate per hour arrangement and are earned when the service is rendered 
some of our consulting clients pay a retainer at the beginning of a project 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the engagement 
consulting revenue generated by the executive benefits practice  banking practice and healthcare group are included in the first year revenue line on our consolidated income statement 
administrative service fee revenue 
administrative service fee revenue consists of fees we charge our clients for the administration of their benefit programs and are earned when services are rendered 
these revenues are included in our renewal revenue line on our consolidated income statement 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed an analysis of the services provided and timing thereof under our administrative services agreements at our executive benefits practice 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that because of changes in the timing of the services being provided  revenue under these agreements should have been recognized on the straight line during historically  these fees were recognized in the renewal month and ratably over the remainder of the annual service agreement 
as a result  the first three quarters of the year ended december   have been restated from the amounts previously reported to recognize administrative service fees on a straight line basis 
we record revenue on a gross basis when we are the primary obligor in the arrangement or when we bear the credit risk in the arrangement 
we record revenue on a net basis when another party is the primary obligor in the arrangement or when another party bears the credit risk 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred are characterized as revenues and are shown as a separate component of total revenue 
similarly  related reimbursable expenses are also shown separately within operating expenses 
eitf issue no 
was effective as of january  and all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the adoption of this accounting literature 
the net result of the above is an increase in revenue and operating expense of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these reclassifications had no effect on our operating income 
intangible assets we have intangible assets representing the excess of the costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the tangible net assets associated with an acquisition 
intangible assets consist of the net present value of future cash flows from policies in force at the acquisition date  non compete agreements with the former owners  other identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
non compete agreements are amortized over the period of the agreements and other identifiable intangibles are amortized over their useful lives 
the net present value of in force revenue is typically amortized between and years the expected average policy duration 
the determination of the amortization schedule involves making certain assumptions related to persistency  expenses  and discount rates that are used in the calculation of the carrying value of in force revenue 
if any of these assumptions change or actual experience differs materially from the assumptions used  it could affect the carrying value of the in force revenue 
we are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and the net present value of future cash flows from policies in force  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
employee compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
common stock options issued to employees to date did not result in compensation expense because the exercise price of the option equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
we have elected to remain on the current method of accounting as described above for employees 
however  we account for stock options granted to non employees under the provisions of sfas no 
employees are eligible for bonuses based upon us achieving certain pre determined targets 
the bonus expense is accrued ratably over the year based upon our estimate of meeting these targets 
this bonus accrual is reviewed and adjusted periodically 
financial statement overview our revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to for the year ended december   an increase of 
our net income for after cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  net of tax  from the adoption of sfas no 
was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of over diluted earnings per share for was compared to for the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the banking practice experienced strong revenue growth of between december  and december  as a result of the closing of numerous cases in the community banking sector and the acquisition of longmiller in november the increase of approximately million of first year commission and fee revenue and approximately million of renewal revenue is attributable to the acquisition of longmiller 
revenue growth was also strong in the healthcare group which benefited from increased first year commission and fee revenue 
revenue was positively impacted by approximately million with the february acquisition of federal policy group  which provides tax and legislative consulting services 
new business revenue includes million received pursuant to an administrative services agreement and bonus forfeiture agreement with an insurance carrier with which a significant amount of in force insurance is in place see administrative services agreement and bonus forfeiture agreement below 
our executive benefits practice experienced a decline in revenue from million in to million in as a result of the current economic conditions and proposed legislation related to the structure of deferred compensation plans that has caused clients to delay implementing new deferred compensation plans 
these circumstances may continue in future periods and adversely affect our ability to generate future revenue in ebp 
commission expense 
commission and fee expense was million  or of total revenue for the year ended december   versus million  or of total revenue for the year ended december  this reduction in the percentage of commission expense as a percentage of revenue reflects an increased proportion of revenue from fee based consulting activity in as well as an increase in the percentage of revenue generated from employee consultants 
we expect our recent acquisition of longmiller to result in a significantly greater percentage of commission expense as a percentage of revenue in the future 
fee based consulting activity accounted for of december  revenue compared to of december  revenue 
included in commission expense is  of non cash expense recognized in from performance based stock options issued to non employee producers 
such expenses may be incurred in the future if certain non employee producers achieve specified targets 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million or of total revenue compared to million or of total revenue for the year ended december  the increase is attributed to the expanded staffing of sales consultants and support services company wide and expenses associated with recent acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses also include million of general and administrative expense  which includes approximately  of severance costs associated with not pursuing the international employment solutions practice  for human capital practice since may in addition  general and administrative expense includes  of severance costs related to reorganization initiatives in the healthcare group that occurred in second quarter amortization 
amortization expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year period 
the reduction in amortization expense resulted from the january adoption of sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill  offset by amortization related to identifiable intangibles through acquisitions in for the year ended december   amortization expense included million pre tax attributed to goodwill amortization 
the acquisition of longmiller is expected to add approximately million of amortization expense in as a result of a full year s of amortization of the net present value of in force revenue 
we acquired approximately million of in force revenue with our november acquisition of longmiller and the results include one month of amortization related to this intangible asset 
other income 
during  we received  rental income from a tenant 
during  we received  of life insurance proceeds as the result of the death of one of our employees  and rental income from a tenant of interest expense net 
net interest expense for the year december  was million compared to million in in  we recorded interest expense of approximately million as a result of the interest rate swap settlements associated with the pay off of our outstanding bank debt with the proceeds from our secondary equity offering 
as a result  we had minimal debt outstanding during the first half of with the november acquisition of longmiller  we borrowed approximately million on our line of credit and issued million of non recourse insurance revenue asset backed notes 
for  interest expense is expected to increase significantly with the incurrence of this additional indebtedness 
income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million at an effective tax rate of compared to million at an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was affected by the filing of an amended tax return during the third quarter which reduced the overall tax rate 
net income 
net income  after an impairment charge of  net of taxes from the adoption of sfas no 
 for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted common share versus net income of million or per diluted share for the same period last year 
the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding increased to million shares for the year ended december  from million shares for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
for the year ended december   our total revenue was million  an increase of over million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to a full year s results for compensation resource group full twelve months compared to four months in and pearl meyer full twelve months compared to six months in  and the addition of rich florin solutions inc fdba executive alliance in march in addition  we had strong sales results in the corporate and community banking markets in commission expense 
commission expense increased from million in to million in  and was negatively impacted by a larger percentage of sales in that were generated by independent consultants who typically are paid higher commissions 
however  this was partially offset by the larger percentage of total sales in generated by pearl meyer and human capital practice which has no commission expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in the increase can be primarily attributed to the full year results of compensation resource group  pearl meyer and the five acquisitions completed in general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue has declined from to due to integration activities and spreading of fixed costs over a larger revenue base 
during  general and administrative expense for the corporate headquarters was million as compared to million in this increase over prior year can be attributed primarily to expenses related to the start up of the reinsurance business and larger bonuses in as a result of our performance 
amortization 
amortization was million in or higher than million incurred in this is a result of a full year s amortization cost for compensation resource group and pearl meyer 
approximately million of the amortization in related to goodwill 
interest expense net 
net interest expense excluding the interest expense for the settlement of an interest rate swap associated with the pay off of our outstanding bank debt with the proceeds from our secondary offering was million in compared to million in the prior year 
we borrowed million during the year to fund our acquisitions 
income taxes 
income taxes in were million which resulted in an effective tax rate of compared with million or an effective tax rate of in we received a refund for prior year s taxes of approximately million during the year which reduced our rate for the tax year 
in  we received a state tax refund of  and non taxable life insurance proceeds of million which lowered our effective tax rate in that year 
net income 
net income of million in represented a million  or a increase over on a diluted per share basis  earnings were  an increase of over significant acquisitions on november   we acquired long  miller associates  llc longmiller 
longmiller  located in greensboro  north carolina  specializes in bank owned life insurance portfolio services 
for the nine months ended september  and the year ended december   longmiller had revenues of million and million  respectively  and operating income of million and million  respectively 
this acquisition enhances our capabilities by coupling longmiller s product offerings and personnel with our current banking practice s extensive distribution channel 
we financed this acquisition  with a purchase price of approximately million and transaction costs of approximately  through the issuance of million of non recourse debt secured by commission and related payments from in force policies sold by longmiller  a draw down of approximately million on our existing credit facility and the issuance of million of our common stock at per share 
the results of longmiller are included in our banking practice results from date of acquisition 
the unaudited pro forma information below presents our results as if the acquisition of longmiller had occurred on january  year ended december  pro forma revenue   net income   diluted earnings per share more detailed financial information relating to longmiller and pro forma financial information relating to our results if the acquisition had been completed on january   are contained in our current report on form k filed with the sec on january  on february   we acquired the federal policy group of pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
based in washington  dc  federal policy group is a consulting practice representing fortune companies  trade associations and other businesses before the government on legislative and regulatory policy matters 
this acquisition allows us to continue to expand our service offerings to the corporate market 
the purchase price was million before acquisition costs  consisting of a cash payment at closing of million and million of contingent payments over the next four years based upon attainment of established performance criteria 
if earned  the contingent payments will consist of cash and our common stock 
as of september   federal policy group attained its performance criteria 
accordingly  million has been included in accrued liabilities and goodwill on the december  balance sheet 
the results of the federal policy group are included in the consolidated results from date of acquisition 
with the acquisition of federal policy group  it became our sixth operating segment 
our evaluation focus is on the quality of the management and future earnings and growth potential of the target company 
in several of our acquisitions  we also acquire the financial value embedded in a book of recurring renewal business that is expected to be realized for many years after the acquisition takes place 
up until now  our future renewal revenue stream has been the source of collateral for our acquisition line of credit 
as we acquire more businesses that do not have this attribute  this may limit our future borrowing availability 
we typically structure a majority of the purchase price in cash 
we acquire little in the way of tangible assets  thus creating a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet 
the companies we acquire are typically privately owned and structured as subchapter s corporations with the income taxed directly to the shareholders and the acquisitions are usually effected through a purchase of assets 
from time to time we are involved in negotiations relating to the acquisition of companies in our industry or related industries 
some of these negotiations could involve companies whose acquisition would be highly material to our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs in connection with negotiating such transactions  even if the transactions are not completed 
formation of human capital practice on may   we announced the formation of our human capital practice 
the new practice includes our existing rewards and performance group and ten former partners partners and support staff from the human capital practice of arthur andersen llp andersen 
prior to hiring  the partners and andersen mutually terminated their partnership interest and association with each other free of all restrictive provisions under the andersen partnership agreement and under any agreements relating to the employment with andersen 
we believe any successor liability is mitigated by hiring each new employee in a conventional employer employee relationship 
the former andersen partners received full recourse and interest bearing loans in the amount of million 
of these loans  million have a term of two years and the remaining million have a term of six and one half years 
as long as the partner is employed on the hiring anniversary date for the two year loans and each december st for the six and one half year loans  a pro rata portion of the loans will be forgiven at each date 
these loans are classified as other assets on the december  balance sheet and are being amortized into the human capital practice financial results as general and administrative expense 
in october  we agreed with one of the partners to terminate our relationship 
in december  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to the forgiveness of part of the partner s loan 
the remaining loan amount of approximately  will be received over the next six years 
assuming all remaining partners continue to be employed by us throughout the terms of the loans  the amounts amortized into operating expense for the following fiscal years would be and thereafter in addition  support staff received a total of  in sign on bonuses at the time of their employment 
the support staff will retain the bonus payments if they remain employed through may  if they voluntarily leave before this date  they must repay a pro rata portion of their bonus 
the sign on bonuses are amortized into the human capital practice results over the first twelve months of employment 
as of december   approximately  is included in other assets 
in connection with the formation of the human capital practice  the asset purchase agreement for rewards and performance group formerly rich  florin solutions  inc was amended 
one half of the original contingent consideration approximately million will be paid in march through march regardless of performance of the practice and the other half is contingent upon the results of the human capital practice 
accordingly  million has been accrued with a corresponding increase in goodwill 
administrative services agreement and bonus forfeiture agreement on september   we entered into an administrative services agreement and bonus forfeiture agreement with an affiliate of ausa holding  inc  one of our principal stockholders and insurance carrier 
during  we received million for services rendered prior to and through september  and recognized a total of million in  pursuant to this agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  we expect to continue to receive approximately million annually from the carrier for a period of years  depending upon certain conditions 
of this annual amount million is included in the cash flows securitizing the asset backed notes issued to finance the acquisition of longmiller  and we will not have access to this cash for general corporate purposes until the securitized notes are fully paid 
this revenue  net of amounts provided for chargebacks  will be recognized on a monthly basis beginning in october the amounts received are subject to chargeback reimbursement of a portion of amounts received if any policies under this agreement are surrendered or exchanged 
any chargeback amounts would be deducted from the next scheduled payment 
recent developments tax and legislative initiatives in recent years  the internal revenue service irs has undertaken a major enforcement initiative to disallow the interest deductions on certain leveraged business owned life insurance programs sold during or prior to the irs has prevailed on the cases it has litigated to date related to this initiative and has recently made a temporary public settlement offer to address ongoing cases 
while we stopped selling leveraged business owned life insurance programs after and we do not expect any material adverse impact on our revenue from this enforcement initiative  it is impossible to determine the impact of this initiative on a client s decision to continue or surrender an existing leveraged business owned life insurance program 
on july   president bush signed the sarbanes oxley act of into law 
this law generally prohibits any personal loans from certain sec regulated companies to current directors or executive officers of such companies 
while it is not entirely clear  there is a possibility that company premium payments made on or after july  on collateral assignment split dollar policies  on current directors or executive officers of those sec regulated companies  could be covered by the loan prohibition 
without favorable clarification of this law  revenue from collateral assignment split dollar arrangements could be reduced as a result of this law 
we have certain split dollar policies with four of our officers 
these policies are expected to be terminated in change in insurable interest laws there have been several recent proposals in various states eg  georgia  texas  washington  and california to change the insurable interest and other state laws governing the ability of an employer to purchase or hold life insurance on the lives of employees 
significant segments of the life insurance industry are engaged in an ongoing  intensive effort to prevent the enactment of state law changes that would have an adverse impact on business owned life insurance 
if one or more states were to adopt proposals limiting the ability of employers to purchase or hold life insurance on the lives of employees  the market for these policies would be reduced and a number of existing policies could be surrendered or exchanged  with a resulting reduction in our revenues from these arrangements 
interest rate swaps on january   we entered into two interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million to hedge million of term debt 
the terms of these interest rate swaps are as follows fixed rate to variable rate to notional amount be paid be received maturity date million libor december  million libor december  related party transactions we lease  square feet of office space owned by our chairman and chief executive officer  w

this amount was accrued in our financial statements as of december  in  mr 
wamberg and richard chapman  executive vice president of clark bardes  inc and president of the banking practice  have collectively invested million in a company of which george dalton  a member of our board of directors  is founder and majority shareholder

william archer  a member of our board of directors since february  is a senior policy advisor at pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
we previously engaged pricewaterhousecoopers llp to perform various consulting related to the installation of our wide area network and a knowledge management system at one of our compensation consulting practices 
in addition  pricewaterhousecoopers was retained by one of our practices to perform certain legislative work 
during and  we paid approximately  and  respectively  to pricewaterhousecoopers llp for these services 
on february   we acquired the federal policy group of pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
the purchase price was million before acquisition costs of approximately  consisting of a cash payment at closing of million and million of contingent payments over the next four years based upon attainment of established performance criteria 
robert long became a member of our board of directors in january as a result of the longmiller acquisition 
he received a substantial amount of the proceeds including notes from our november purchase of longmiller 
on september   we entered into an administrative services agreement and bonus forfeiture agreement with an affiliate of ausa holding  inc  one of our principal stockholders 
during  we received million for services rendered prior to and through september  and recognized a total of million in  pursuant to this agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  we expect to continue to receive approximately million annually from the carrier for a period of years  depending upon certain conditions 
of this annual amount  million is included in the cash flows securitizing the asset backed notes issued to finance the acquisition of longmiller  and we will not have access to this cash for general corporate purposes until the securitization notes are fully paid 
this revenue  net of amounts provided for chargebacks  are being recognized on a monthly basis beginning in october the amounts received are subject to chargeback reimbursement of a portion of amounts received if any policies under this agreement are surrendered or exchanged 
any chargeback amounts would be deducted from the next scheduled payment

steve piaker  a member of our board of directors  is a partner with conning capital partners 
quarterly results our operating results can fluctuate considerably  especially when compared on a consecutive quarterly basis 
we can experience large increases in revenue in the first and fourth quarter and operating results may be affected by a number of other factors  including new or enhanced programs and services by us or our competitors and client acceptance or rejection of these programs  program development expenses  competitive  legislative and regulatory changes and general economic conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
sales cycles often take between twelve to eighteen months  with a significant amount of revenue that can come from a few large cases 
our revenue is thus difficult to forecast  and we believe that comparing our consecutive quarterly results of operations is not necessarily meaningful  nor does it indicate what results we will achieve for any subsequent period 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed an analysis of the services provided and timing thereof under our administrative services agreements at our executive benefits practice 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that because of changes in the timing of the services being provided  revenue under these agreements should have been recognized on the straight line during historically  these fees were recognized in the renewal month and ratably over the remainder of the annual service agreement 
in addition  we are also restating to reflect a timing difference whereby cbfs was under recognizing revenue in the period earned 
this restatement for cbfs had no impact on prior years reported or on results for the full year 
as a result  the first three quarters of the year ended december   have been restated from the amounts previously reported to recognize administrative service fees on a straight line basis and record cbfs revenue in the appropriate period

our revenue is difficult to forecast  and we believe that comparing our consecutive quarterly results of operations is not necessarily meaningful  nor does it indicate what results we will achieve for any subsequent period 
our quarterly results can vary due to the timing of acquisitions and or the closing of large cases  which may not repeat in subsequent quarters 
as a result  past operating results are not reliable indicators of future performance 
segment results the following analysis depicts the results of each of our operating segments on a stand alone basis 
no allocation of corporate overhead or interest has been made 
executive benefits practice operating results year ended december  revenue first year commissions and related fees    renewal commissions and related fees    reimbursable expenses total revenue    operating expenses commissions and fees    of revenue general and administrative    of revenue reimbursable expenses amortization    operating income    of revenue executive benefits practice ebp revenue decreased from december  as a result of current economic and legislative conditions which caused clients to delay implementation of new deferred compensation plans 
we may continue to experience revenue declines in future periods due to the economy and legislation 
the acquisitions of comiskey kaufman  inc acquired april  lyons compensation and benefits  llc acquired august and coates kenney acquired december contributed approximately million to the year ended december  revenue and million of operating income 
renewal revenue increased due to higher than anticipated premium payments on in force business and additional renewals from new business 
general and administrative expense increased for the year ended december  over due to the acquisitions mentioned above and additional hirings 
amortization expense decreased in when compared to primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as of january  goodwill amortization for ebp in was approximately  revenue was million for compared to million for this increase of million is primarily attributed to a full year of results in for compensation resource group full twelve months in versus four months in and strong first quarter sales 
commission expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in due to more sales being generated by senior consultants who are generally paid a higher commission expense 
general and administrative expenses increased over primarily due to a full year of expenses in for compensation resource group

these increases reflect significant sales growth in the community bank market  and include only limited contribution from the large bank market  which has been more adversely affected by the economy 
approximately million of the increase to renewal revenue is attributable to the acquisition of longmiller which was completed november  commission expense for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  compared to million or of revenue in the same period in commission expense as a percentage of revenue increased due to the mix of business between independent and employee consultants 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  compared to million or of revenue for the comparable period in  due to the acquisitions of hilgenberg and longmiller  and investments in staffing of sales consultants and support staff to service increased sales volumes 
revenue increased in compared to primarily due to strong first year sales in the community banking sector 
reduction in the commission expense as percentage of revenue from in to in relates to more sales being generated by employee consultants who have a lower commission structure than independent consultants 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was in and in this has improved as a result of consolidation of the majority of the banking business in minneapolis  thereby centralizing several administrative functions

the human capital practice results reflect difficulties related to the start up of a new consulting practice in the current challenging economic climate

however  the practice is beginning to experience more sales activity as a result of engagements in its areas of expertise of corporate governance and executive compensation 
although other segments offer compensation consulting in connection with their benefit plan activities  the june acquisition of pearl meyer partners represented our major initiative into this vital and logical extension of our business

results attributable to acquisitions as an active acquirer  our operating results are significantly influenced by the contributions of our acquired businesses 
for reporting purposes  we consider the operating results from any business not appearing in four complete quarters as being from acquisitions 
after that  they become part of existing business 
non material acquisitions are not included in the acquisition column 
an analysis of our operating results  separating acquisitions from existing business is as follows year ended year ended december  december  existing acquisitions combined existing acquisitions combined revenue first year commissions and consulting fees       renewal commissions and related fees      reimbursable expenses     total revenue       operating expenses commissions and fees      general and administrative

in addition  the statistics only breakout acquisitions that are considered material to our financial results 
finally  the resources of our existing businesses that are dedicated to our acquisition program could have had an impact on the performance of the existing business had the acquisitions not been made 
liquidity and capital resources selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 
as of december  cash and cash equivalents   working capital   current ratio to one shareholders equity per common share debt to total capitalization includes restricted cash and current portion of debt associated with asset backed notes 
total stockholders equity divided by actual shares outstanding at year 
current debt plus long term debt divided by current debt plus long term debt plus stockholders equity in the acquisition of longmiller  we incurred approximately million in additional debt 
of this amount  million represents non recourse debt asset backed notes incurred by a wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary and secured by certain renewal commissions and related payments associated with in force policies previously sold by longmiller 
the remaining million was drawn under our revolving credit facility 
in addition to our tangible balance sheet assets and liabilities  we have an on going non securitized renewal revenue stream  estimated to be million over the next ten years 
this on going renewal revenue stream reflects current conditions and is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that may actually be achieved in the future and we cannot assure you that commissions under these policies will be received 
see estimated future gross renewal revenue below 
as a service organization with historically strong operating cash flow and a revolving credit facility  we believe we have little need to maintain substantial cash balances 
we use net cash from operating activities primarily to fund capital expenditures  small acquisitions and service existing debt 
we expect large cash outlays and future acquisitions will be financed primarily through externally available funds 
however  we can offer no assurance such funds will be available and  if so  on terms acceptable to us 
year ended december  cash flows from used in operating    investing    financing    cash flows from operating activities our cash flow from operating activities for the twelve months ended december    and were as follows year ended december  net income plus non cash expenses    changes in operating assets and liabilities    cash flow from operating activities

the non cash expenses mentioned above include depreciation of equipment and leasehold improvements  amortization of intangibles  impairment charge for adoption of sfas no 
 and charge for performance based stock options issued to non employee producers 
estimated future gross renewal revenue the following table represents the estimated gross renewal revenue associated with our in force business owned life insurance policies as of december  the projected gross revenue is not adjusted for mortality  lapse or other factors that may impair realization 
we cannot assure you that commissions under these policies will be received

 the year in force revenue net of commission expense are million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   acquisitions accounted for million used in investing activities and million was used for the purchase of equipment 
cash spending for acquisitions included federal policy group comiskey kaufman hilgenberg longmiller nicb earnout rewards and performance earnout the wamberg organization earnout other earnouts a substantial portion of the purchase price used to fund the acquisitions has historically been paid in cash 
this is primarily due to our desire to avoid diluting our existing shareholders 
we expect acquisitions to continue and be financed primarily from available credit lines and possible additional equity 
however  we can offer no assurances such will be the case 
cash flows from financing activities in order to finance the acquisition of longmiller  we entered into a million gross securitization of a majority of the in force revenues of longmiller 
the securitization is broken into four tranches  each rated by standard poors 
the tranches consist of the a and a class totaling approximately million and each rated aaa  the b class tranch of million rated a and the c class tranch of million rated bbb 
the weighed average interest cost over the year life of the asset backed notes is approximately seven percent 
the securitized net in force revenues  which are approximately million in  are used to pay interest and principal to the bondholders 
assuming the securitized notes amortize as expected  the securitization will provide residual cash flow to us of approximately five percent of the securitized in force revenue in the initial years  and our total residual interest would equal approximately percent of the total securitized in force revenue over the expected life of the asset backed notes 
such residual interest could be substantially less if the notes do not amortize as expected 
the securitization is treated as debt  is included in the banking practice segment  and is non recourse to clark bardes  inc as of december   there was restricted cash of approximately million which will be used to pay down the asset backed notes issued to finance the acquisition of longmiller 
this cash is not available for general corporate purposes  but is solely to service securitization indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of longmiller 
in may  we amended our december  credit agreement to increase the amount available under the credit facility to million 
we converted million of the year end amount under the revolving credit facility to term debt at december  the term debt will be paid quarterly over five years under the term facility agreement 
we had million available under our credit lines at december  the restrictive covenants under the new loan agreement provide for the maintenance of a minimum ratio of fixed charges  a maximum allowable leverage ratio  a minimum amount of net worth stockholders equity  and a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization 
we were in compliance with all our restrictive covenants as of december  our restrictive covenants may limit our borrowing ability under our credit line 
we believe that our cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide sufficient funds to service our debt obligations 
however  as our business grows  our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will also continue to increase 
there can be no assurance that the net cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow requirements or that we will not require additional debt or equity financing in the future 
we may continue to issue stock to finance future acquisitions

this average interest rate of borrowings of prime and libor at december  the interest rate on the outstanding term debt and revolver is variable based on current prime or libor rates

recent accounting pronouncements business combinations and goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
eliminates the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with determinable lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of we tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a determination of potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we performed the required impairment tests of goodwill as of january  in the first quarter of an after tax impairment charge of   before tax resulting from these impairment tests is reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year 
no additional impairment was recorded in on january   we adopted sfas no

in order to finance the acquisition of longmiller  we entered into a million gross securitization of a majority of the in force revenues of longmiller 
the securitization is broken into four tranches  each rated by standard poors 
the tranches consist of the a and a class totaling approximately million and each rated aaa  the b class tranch of million rated a and the c class tranch of million rated bbb 
the weighed average interest cost over the year life of the asset backed notes is approximately seven percent 
the securitized net in force revenues  which are approximately million in  are used to pay interest and principal to the noteholders

such residual interest could be substantially less if the notes do not amortize as expected
