item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations following are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies 
table of contents require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

table of contents contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation advertising and promotion expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
certain contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property  plant and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded as other expense 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas effective for the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by fas  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized 
table of contents in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
our estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
as discussed further below  upon adoption of fas  we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of million 
this charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change 
in future periods  any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 
other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 
any impairment charges would be classified as other expense 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes significantly  we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense during the quarter in which such changes occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

table of contents we take a conservative approach in determining the amount of foreign earnings to declare as reinvested offshore 
as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  the presumption is that such earnings will be repatriated in the future 
we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of such foreign earnings  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this conservative approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our conservative approach may result in accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided being determined in the future to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred

revenue growth in our international regions drove the increase in consolidated revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal changes in currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  were responsible for of the consolidated revenue growth 

table of contents our largest international region  europe  middle east and africa emea  reported revenue growth in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth reflected a percentage point improvement due to changes in currency exchange rates 
growth in the emerging markets in central and eastern europe was the key driver of the balance of the increase  as our distribution continued to expand in these markets and customer demand increased 
excluding the effect from changes in currency exchange rates  each of our emea business units  footwear  apparel  and equipment  delivered revenue growth versus the prior year 
emea pre tax income grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal higher revenues and improved gross margins drove the increase  more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs 
in asia pacific  revenues increased in fiscal  five percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the benefit from changes in currency exchange rates  sales in each asia pacific business unit grew in fiscal  as did sales in almost every country of the region  particularly japan and korea  driven primarily by heightened consumer demand for our products following the world cup and our related marketing campaign  and china  driven primarily by an expansion of retail distribution of our products 
pre tax income for the asia pacific region increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase reflected higher revenues and improved gross margins that more than offset higher selling and administrative costs 
in the americas region  fiscal revenues decreased compared to fiscal  reflecting higher sales in local currencies that were more than offset by a percentage point decline due to changes in currency exchange rates 
this currency exchange impact was due to weaker currencies in the latin american markets  partially offset by the stronger canadian dollar 
excluding the currency exchange rate impact  the region experienced sales growth in the footwear and equipment business units slightly offset by a small percentage decrease in the apparel business unit 
on a geographic basis  excluding currency exchange rate impacts  the region experienced sales growth in brazil  argentina  and mexico  reflecting stronger consumer demand 
the sales growth in argentina reflected a rebound since fiscal when that country underwent an economic crisis 
pre tax income for the americas region grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pre tax income improved despite lower reported revenues primarily due to an improved gross margin percentage 
in the us region  revenues were down slightly in fiscal  at  million versus  million in fiscal us footwear revenues were down  more than offsetting sales growth in us apparel and equipment 
us apparel sales increased million dollars  primarily driven by increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel 
lower revenues in the footwear business unit were largely the result of a significant change in our us footwear distribution 
during fiscal  we began a realignment of our us footwear distribution to address the changing retail marketplace  including our largest customer s foot locker reduction in emphasis on premium footwear in its offerings 
the objectives of this realignment are to improve the presentation and profitability of the nike brand in the us as a result of changes in both foot locker s orders and our product offerings to this account  our fiscal sales to foot locker in the us were significantly below the level of fiscal at the same time  we expanded the premium products available to other athletic specialty and independent retailers that focus on premium footwear offerings  increasing sales to these accounts significantly 
based upon us futures orders scheduled for delivery through december  we expect that us footwear revenues will remain below prior year levels at least through the first half of fiscal in the short 
table of contents term  we do not expect to fully offset the revenue decline from foot locker in the us  and the amounts of future sales to foot locker are uncertain 
however  we believe the nike brand continues to enjoy strong consumer demand and that we will successfully realign our distribution to fulfill consumers demand for our products and generate profitable revenue growth 
our unit sales of footwear in the us increased slightly as compared to fiscal however  this volume increase was more than offset by a decline in the average price per pair of footwear sold 
the reduction in average price per pair in fiscal versus fiscal reflected a higher percentage of sales of classic footwear and kids models  which have a lower average price than our more complex adult performance models 
based upon futures orders  average price per pair ordered by customers for delivery in the first quarter of fiscal was slightly below the prior year  but the average price per pair increased for second quarter orders 
us region pre tax income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pre tax income improved  despite lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense  due to improved gross margins 
other revenues include revenues from bauer nike hockey  inc  cole haan holdings  inc  hurley international llc  and nike golf 
in fiscal  we began managing the nike golf operations in our largest golf markets separately from our regional businesses 
as a result  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  revenues and pre tax income for these businesses have been excluded from the regional results and reported in the other category 
this nike golf information for fiscal and fiscal has been reclassified in this form k to conform to the fiscal presentation 
other revenues grew in fiscal compared to fiscal the addition of revenues from our hurley business  purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal  drove the increase in other revenues 
other pre tax income declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal reduced profitability at nike golf drove this decline  reflecting significantly weaker demand in the us golf market versus fiscal and start up issues we experienced at a third party distribution facility 
we expect that demand in the us for golf products throughout the industry and for our business may remain weak in the near term due to the current slowdown of the us economy

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
as discussed in note operating segments and related information in the attached notes to consolidated financial statements  certain corporate costs are not included in pre tax income of our operating segments 
worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june to november were higher than such orders reported in the comparable period of fiscal five points of this reported increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year 
on our june  press release  we reported that worldwide futures and advance orders for this period were up as compared to last year and that futures and advance orders in the us were down as compared to last year 
our futures program permits changes to orders for a short period of time following the order deadline 
such changes to us orders  most notably additional orders of footwear from foot locker  increased the growth in worldwide futures for the june to november period by percentage points  to  and reduced the decrease in us orders from to 
these orders were for footwear consistent with our distribution realignment strategy discussed above 
the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenues is not derived from futures orders  including wholesale sales of equipment  
table of contents us licensed team apparel  bauer nike hockey  cole haan  nike golf  hurley  and retail sales across all brands 
in fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage improved points as compared to fiscal  from to 
significant factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage were as follows product cost reductions resulting from our global initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce materials costs 
a higher mix of sales of classic footwear models which are generally more profitable than our more complex performance models 
lower pricing of nike golf products as a result of market conditions discussed above partially offset these positive margin drivers 
changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal as the benefit of stronger hedge rates in some currencies was offset by weaker hedge rates in other currencies 
a significant portion of product purchases for fiscal are already hedged and we expect that changes in year over year hedge rates will have a net positive effect on our gross margin percentage in fiscal  as the benefits of stronger euro hedge rates more than offset weaker hedge rates in other currencies 
selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal both demand creation and operating overhead expense increased as a percentage of revenues 
demand creation expense grew from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal higher costs incurred in the emea region drove the growth in demand creation expense  reflecting  a stronger euro currency exchange rate compared to the us dollar  which resulted in higher us dollar expenses for costs that are euro denominated  our new endorsement agreement with the manchester united soccer team that became effective in august  and costs of our world cup marketing campaign incurred in the first quarter of fiscal higher demand creation expenses were also incurred in the asia pacific and americas regions due to the world cup marketing campaign 
we also increased demand creation spending in the us in order to drive continued consumer demand for footwear while we realign our distribution to retail customers 
operating overhead increased from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal major drivers of this increase were the stronger euro exchange rate  incremental costs related to our on going development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain  primarily reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in note operating segments and related information  investments in headcount for our nike golf business  the addition of hurley overhead costs beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and overhead costs of additional retail stores in emea and asia pacific 
as part of our worldwide supply chain initiative  we implemented new systems in the emea region in fiscal prior to the emea region implementation  we implemented new systems and processes for certain global functions and for our us and canadian businesses 
over the next few years  we will continue to enhance and refine the systems and processes in the us  emea and canada as well as implement our new supply chain platform in the remaining countries in which we operate 
over this time period  operating overhead expense will continue to include costs of the supply chain initiative as well as costs for supporting our existing system infrastructure for those businesses where we have not yet implemented the new systems 
this initiative is intended to improve revenue by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions  margins by lowering close outs and distribution costs and cash flow by reducing inventories 
in the us  where the new systems have been in place for over a year  we have begun to see improvements in several key performance measures 
the ultimate level of benefit  if any  to revenues  margins  and cash flows will not be known until the new systems and processes have been implemented in the remaining countries in which we operate and globally integrated over the next few years 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decline of 
the decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels  as we have used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt 

table of contents other income expense was net expense of million compared to net expense of million in fiscal significant amounts included in other income expense were interest income  profit sharing expense  goodwill amortization fiscal only  and certain foreign currency gains and losses 
an increase in net foreign currency losses was the largest contributor to the increase in other expense versus last year 
these foreign currency losses were primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany charges to a european subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro 
these losses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in note operating segments and related information 
the hedge losses reflected that the euro has strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts 
in fiscal  net foreign currency losses in other income expense were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits 
our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a million addition to consolidated income before income taxes 
consistent with our existing policies  we have continued to hedge anticipated intercompany charges for fiscal since the euro has continued to strengthen since these hedge contracts were executed  we expect to continue to incur some hedge losses in fiscal however  we expect the net impact of the hedge losses and the offsetting positive translation impact will result in a net benefit to fiscal consolidated net income versus the prior year 
our fiscal effective tax rate was  relatively consistent with the fiscal effective rate of 
included in fiscal net income was a million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing fas this charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with bauer nike hockey and the goodwill of cole haan  reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as discussed above  our fiscal and fiscal nike golf information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
this presentation reflects significant nike golf operations as a separate business in the other category rather than within each of our geographical regions 
the following discussion of fiscal results versus fiscal by region reflects this reclassification of nike golf operations 
this reclassification did not result in any change to our previously reported consolidated results  nor did it result in a significant change to the previously reported revenue and profitability trends in each of our regional businesses in fiscal this reclassification did result in significantly higher revenues and profits reported in the other category 

table of contents in the us region  revenues were flat in fiscal versus fiscal  reflecting increased sales of apparel and equipment offset by decreased sales of footwear 
the increased sales in apparel reflected higher demand for in line products  particularly for nike brand and brand jordan basketball apparel  more than offsetting the effect of the expiration of our apparel license agreement with the national football league in fiscal while in line sales of footwear increased in fiscal  particularly in the mid range price segment  close out sales decreased significantly 
the reduction in close out sales reflected both our efforts to limit the availability of close out products in the marketplace in order to build overall profitability and relatively high levels of close out sales in the last half of fiscal due to supply chain system disruptions 
as in the apparel business  sales of nike brand and brand jordan basketball footwear products were the primary drivers of increased wholesale sales of in line footwear during the year 
despite revenues and selling and administrative expense being essentially consistent with fiscal  us pre tax income increased from million to million  driven primarily by an improved gross margin percentage 
in fiscal  revenues from our international regions grew versus the prior year 
changes in currency exchange rates decreased the international region growth rate percentage points and decreased our consolidated growth rate percentage points 
fiscal reported revenues in emea increased by over fiscal  including a percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the negative effect of currency exchange rates  emea revenues grew in each of our business units  footwear  apparel  and equipment and in almost every country in the region  reflecting increasing demand for nike brand products throughout emea 
emea pre tax income grew from million to million 
growth in revenues and a higher gross margin percentage drove the increase in pre tax income 
in our asia pacific region  reported revenues grew  including a percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates 
asia pacific revenues grew in each business unit and in almost every country in the region  with the largest growth coming from japan  korea  and china 
pre tax income for the asia pacific region increased from million to million 
the increase in revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues drove the growth in pre tax income  which was partially offset by a decline in gross margin percentage 
the americas region reported revenues grew  including a percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates  despite a drop off in sales in argentina during the second half of fiscal as a result of the country s economic crisis 
revenues in the americas region grew in each of our business units  led by growth in canada  mexico  and brazil 
pre tax income for the americas region increased from million to million 
the increase in revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues drove the growth in pre tax income  which was partially offset by a decline in gross margin percentage 
in fiscal  other revenues  including revenues from bauer nike hockey  cole haan  hurley  and nike golf  increased to million  driven by growth in nike golf 
the hurley acquisition did not have a significant impact on fiscal revenues since the acquisition did not occur until the last quarter of fiscal other pre tax income declined from million to million  driven by a decline in profitability at cole haan 
despite slight revenue growth at cole haan during the year  pre tax income declined due to relatively high discounting and inventory obsolescence as a result of depressed consumer demand in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks 

table of contents our gross margin percentage improved from in fiscal to in fiscal factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage in fiscal were as follows higher in line pricing margins in emea  due to the effect of higher prices effective at the beginning of the fiscal year and sourcing and warehousing efficiencies  partially offset by the effect of weaker euro us dollar currency hedge rates relative to fiscal higher footwear margins in the us due in part to lower product costs and lower transportation costs  as a result of both effective negotiations with shippers and lower air freight costs incurred 
relatively higher air freight costs were incurred in fiscal due to supply chain system problems 
a higher mix of in line sales versus close out sales of us footwear  reflecting increased demand for in line footwear and lower close out sales as compared to fiscal as discussed above 
selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal operating overhead increased in fiscal significant drivers of the increased operating overhead included increased investment in our supply chain initiative  additional headcount to support our golf and european businesses due to business growth  additional expense for compensation programs tied to our profitability and stock performance  and costs for additional retail stores primarily in our emea and asia pacific regions 
demand creation expense was  million in fiscal versus million in fiscal  which was consistent between years as a percentage of revenues 
our fiscal demand creation expense reflected incremental spending for our world cup marketing campaign  which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense decreased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels  as we used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt 
other income expense was a net expense of million in fiscal versus a net expense of million in fiscal significant amounts included in other income expense included interest income  profit sharing expense  goodwill amortization  certain foreign currency gains and losses  and asset disposal gains losses 
net other expense decreased between years as the fiscal amount included charges for contractual settlements that did not recur in fiscal in addition  fiscal other income expense included credits related to the favorable resolution of some outstanding claims 
our fiscal effective tax rate was as compared to in fiscal as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  we do not accrue a us tax liability on foreign earnings permanently invested offshore 
the lower effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily the result of a larger amount of foreign earnings permanently invested offshore in fiscal than in fiscal recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
this statement requires that a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized at fair value in the period the obligation is incurred and the associated retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tangible long lived asset 
all provisions of this statement will be effective for the company on june  we do not expect that the adoption of fas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

this statement supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no

under eitf  a liability was recognized at the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
fas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
the provisions of fas are effective for any exit and disposal activities initiated after 
table of contents december  we have not entered into any significant exit or disposal activities since the effective date of this rule 
as such  fas has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  and no significant impact is expected in the foreseeable future 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the recognition provisions of fin are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin were effective beginning with the third quarter of fiscal in connection with various contracts and agreements  we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights  coverage for legal issues that arise  and other items that fall under the scope of fin currently  we have several such agreements in place 
however  based on our historical experience and estimated probability of future loss  we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material 
hence  the adoption of fin has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  and no significant impact is expected in the foreseeable future

accounting for stock based compensation fas to provide alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
fas also amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require disclosure of the method used to account for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements 
the disclosure provisions are effective for us beginning with this fiscal annual report on form k 
the annual impact of a change to the fair value model prescribed by fas has been disclosed in our previous k filings  and the applicable disclosures in this report are in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at this time  we plan to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  rather than change to the fas fair value method 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for those variable interest entities created after january  the provisions are effective for the first period beginning after june  for those variable interests held prior to february  we do not currently have any variable interest entities as defined in fin accordingly  we do not expect the provisions of fin to affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal cash flow activity cash provided by operations was million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow was income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million 
operating cash flow decreased compared to the prior year due to increased investment in certain working capital components during fiscal  including inventories 
while a decline in inventory levels provided a source of cash during fiscal  an increase in inventory levels during fiscal resulted in a use of cash  primarily due to our decision to purchase product for the us back to school selling season earlier than we did last year in order to improve the timeliness of shipments to customers 
cash used by investing activities during fiscal was million  compared to million invested during fiscal the most significant investing activities in both periods were expenditures for 
table of contents computer equipment and software related to our supply chain initiative and continued investment in nike owned retail stores 
spending for both of these activities declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  fiscal spending included our acquisition of all of the assets and substantially all of the liabilities of hurley international llc  an action sports and youth lifestyle brand company 
costs incurred for distribution center projects increased in fiscal  the largest project being construction of a new storage building in japan  with scheduled opening in the second half of fiscal during fiscal  we will continue to make investments in systems improvements most notably the supply chain initiative  retail expansion  and our worldwide distribution center facilities 
additionally  during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to purchase converse inc  discussed further below 
cash used by financing activities in fiscal was million  up from million in the prior year 
this amount included uses of cash for dividends to shareholders  a net reduction in debt  and share repurchases 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
the share repurchases were part of a billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal  after completion of a four year  billion program in fiscal in fiscal  we repurchased million shares of nike s class b common stock for million 
to date  under the current program  we have purchased a total of million shares of nike s class b common stock for million 
we expect to continue to fund the current program from operating cash flow 
the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 
long term financial obligations and other commercial commitments our significant long term contractual obligations as of may  and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows cash payments due during the year ended may  description of commitment thereafter total in millions operating leases long term debt endorsement contracts other the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products 
actual payments under some contracts will likely be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements in future periods 
actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as a limited number of contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athlete performance declines in future periods 
in addition to the cash payments disclosed above  we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with nike products for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source  and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
an outsourcing contractor provides us with information technology operations management services through the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor s services 
if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may   we would be required to provide the contractor with four months notice and pay a termination fee of million 
our monthly payments to the contractor currently are approximately million 

table of contents we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of may  please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note short term borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below 
outstanding as of may  in millions notes payable  due at mutually agreed upon dates  generally ninety days from issuance or on demand payable to nissho iwai american company niac for the purchase of inventories  generally due sixty days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding  primarily for the purchase of inventory 
all letters of credit generally expire within one year 
on july   we entered into an agreement to purchase all of the equity shares of converse inc  a widely recognized footwear company based in massachusetts  for million cash 
prior to closing  this transaction is subject to regulatory review  including us government review under the hart scott rodino premerger notification act 
if the acquisition is completed  we do not expect it will have a significant effect on our liquidity  results of operations or financial position in the short term 
while we do expect a positive impact on our long term profitability from this acquisition  we cannot reasonably estimate this impact at this time 
capital resources in october  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec under which billion in debt securities may be issued 
in may  we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to million in medium term notes  as our capital needs dictate 
we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements 
during fiscal  we issued a total of million in notes under the medium term note program 
the notes have coupon rates that range from to 
the maturities range from july  to august  for each of the notes  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month london inter bank offering rate libor plus a spread 
each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as its respective note 
after issuance of these notes  million remains available to be issued under our medium note program  and another million remains available to be issued under our shelf registration statement 
we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal depending on working capital general corporate needs 
as of may   we had a total of billion available under two committed credit facilities in place with a group of banks  and we currently have no amounts outstanding under either facility 
the first facility is a million  day facility that will mature on november  and can be extended days on each maturity date 
the second facility is a million  multi year facility that matures on november   and once a year it can be extended for one additional year 
both of these facilities have been in place since fiscal during fiscal  upon renewal in november  the day facility was reduced from million to million 
based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively  the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the day facility would be the prevailing libor plus  and the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the multi year facility would be the prevailing libor plus 
the facility fees for the day facility and the multi year facility are and  respectively  of the total commitment 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fees and interest rates under our committed credit facilities would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fees and interest 
table of contents rates would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities 
however  under these committed credit facilities  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur  and set a minimum ratio of net worth to indebtedness 
in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program  under which there was no amount outstanding at may  and million outstanding at may  we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
we currently believe that cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 
dividends per share of common stock for fiscal were  compared to in fiscal we have paid a dividend every quarter since february we review our dividend policy from time to time  however  based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements  we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  production and funding activities 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months  although at may  we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european and japanese subsidiaries 
we use forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in european currencies  japanese yen  canadian dollars  korean won  mexican pesos and australian dollars 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of medium and long term fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay variable interest 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  as defined by the sec  are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  cross currency swaps  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

table of contents we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only  and hence does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based transactions that are anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the var calculation  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the increase in var as of may  occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may  var computation versus the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may  var computation 
such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below  except the interest rate swaps which are described below 
these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  cross currency swaps  and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
we have excluded the cross currency swaps from the foreign exchange risk category because these instruments eliminate all foreign currency exposure in the cash flows of a euro denominated intercompany loan 
we have included these cross currency swaps in the interest rate risk category but excluded the related intercompany loan from this category because the intercompany interest eliminates in consolidation 
for the cross currency swaps the table presents both the euro swap payable and us dollar swap receivable and the respective pay and receive interest rates 
all information is presented in millions of us dollars  except interest rates 
intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation 
intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties 
the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 
there were no significant changes in debt or cross currency swap market risks during fiscal the us dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies was million at may   which is the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination 
the us dollar fair value of the fixed rate japanese yen denominated debt that was outstanding at may  was million versus a carrying value of million at that date 
the us dollar fair values of the fixed rate us dollar denominated debt  the euro swap payable and the us dollar swap receivable as of may  were million  million and million  respectively  versus carrying values of million  million and million  respectively  at that date 

table of contents in fiscal we issued a million long term fixed rate corporate bond which matures in august in fiscal  we issued an additional million in long term fixed rate corporate bonds which mature on various dates beginning in july through august fixed interest rates on these bonds range from to 
for each of these bonds issued in fiscal and fiscal  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month libor plus a spread 
each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond 
as a result of the interest rate swap agreements  the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was at may  and at may  these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges  so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt 
the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps was a million gain at may  and a million loss at may  in fiscal we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries 
the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on month libor plus a spread 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at and receives variable interest payments based on month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of billion japanese yen 
this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge  accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income 
as of may   the recorded fair value of the swap was a million loss 
expected maturity date year ended may  thereafter total fair value in millions  except interest rates foreign exchange risk euro functional currency intercompany loan us dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan british pound denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency intercompany loans euro denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan japanese yen denominated variable rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan canadian dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate interest rate risk japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency long term us dollar debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate fixed euro for fixed us dollar cross currency swap euro swap payable us dollar swap receivable average pay rate euro average receive rate us dollars
