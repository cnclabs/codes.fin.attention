item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of hanover compressor company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
general hanover compressor company  through its subsidiaries  is a global market leader in full service natural gas compression and a leading provider of service  fabrication and equipment for natural gas processing and transportation 
we sell this equipment and provide it on a rental  contract compression  maintenance and acquisition leaseback basis to natural gas production  processing and transportation companies that are seeking outsourcing solutions 
founded in and a public company since  our customers include both major and premier independent oil and gas producers and distributors as well as national oil and gas companies 
our maintenance business  together with our parts and service business  can provide solutions to customers that own their own compression equipment  but want to outsource their operations 
we also have compressor and oil and gas production equipment fabrication operations and provide gas processing and treating  gas measurement and oilfield power generation services  which broaden our customer relationships both domestically and internationally 
the company has grown through internal growth and through acquisitions 
for  the company plans to reduce its capital spending and focus on completing the integration of recent acquisitions 
in addition  we plan to reduce our headcount by approximately employees worldwide and consolidate our fabrication operations into fabrication centers down from the fabrication centers we had as of december  the estimated annualized savings from these actions are expected to be approximately million 
recent events during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our business lines and the board of directors approved management s recommendation to exit and sell our non oilfield power generation facilities and certain used equipment business lines 
the results from these businesses are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation 
additionally  in the second and fourth quarter of  we recorded certain write downs  asset impairments and restructuring costs 
a summary of these changes and the related impact to the company s financial results is discussed below 
in january  we exercised our right to put our interest in the pigap ii joint venture back to schlumberger 
if not exercised  the put right would have expired as of february  hanover acquired its interest in pigap ii as part of its purchase of production operators corporation from schlumberger in august pigap ii is a joint venture  currently owned by a subsidiary of williams companies inc and by hanover  which operates a natural gas compression facility in venezuela that processes billion standard cubic feet per day of natural gas 
the natural gas processed by pigap ii is re injected into oil reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery 
the consummation of the transfer of hanover s interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger is subject to certain consents 
we are currently in discussions with schlumberger to explore the possibility of entering into a new agreement under which hanover would retain the ownership interest in the joint venture 
in light of the ongoing discussions between hanover and schlumberger relating to the put  the parties have agreed to postpone the closing date to no later than may  in february  we executed an amendment to our bank credit facility and certain compression equipment leases that we entered into in and the amendment  effective as of december   modifies certain financial covenants to allow us greater flexibility in accessing the capacity under the bank credit facility to support our short term liquidity needs 
in addition  at the higher end of our permitted consolidated leverage ratio  the amendment would increase the commitment fee under the bank credit facility by and increase the interest rate margins used to calculate the applicable interest rates under all of the agreements by up to 
any increase in our interest cost as a result of the amendment will depend on our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter  the amount of indebtedness outstanding and the interest rate quoted for the benchmark selected by us 
as part of the amendment  we granted the lenders under these agreements a security interest in the inventory  equipment and certain other property of hanover and its domestic subsidiaries  and pledged of the equity interest in certain of hanover s foreign subsidiaries 
in consideration for obtaining the amendment  we agreed to pay approximately million in fees to the lenders under these agreements 
we also agreed to a restriction on our capital expenditures during  which under the agreement cannot exceed million 
in connection with the compression equipment leases entered into in august  we were obligated to prepare registration statements and complete an exchange offering to enable the holders of the notes issued by the lessors to exchange their notes with notes which are registered under the securities act of because of the restatement of our financial statements  the exchange offering was not completed pursuant to the time line required by the agreement and we were required to pay additional lease expense in the amount equal to  per week until the exchange offering was completed 
the additional lease expense began accruing on january  and increased our lease expense by approximately million during the registration statements became effective in february the exchange offer was completed and the requirement to pay the additional lease expense ended on march  recent material acquisitions in august  we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of production operators corporation poi from schlumberger the poi acquisition for million in cash  and hanover common stock and indebtedness  subject to certain post closing adjustments pursuant to the purchase agreement that to date have resulted in an increase in the purchase price to approximately million due to an increase in net assets acquired 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  schlumberger received approximately million in cash excluding the amounts paid for the increase in net assets  million in a long term subordinated note and approximately  shares of hanover common stock  or approximately of the outstanding shares  which are required to be held by schlumberger for at least three years following the closing date 
the ultimate number of shares issued under the purchase agreement was determined based on the nominal value of million divided by per share  the day average closing price of hanover common stock as defined under the acquisition agreement and subject to a collar of and 
the estimated fair value of the stock issued was million  based on the market value of the shares at the time the number of shares issued was determined reduced by an estimated discount due to the restrictions on the stock s marketability 
the poi acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and is included in our financial statements commencing on september  we recorded approximately million in goodwill related to the acquisition of poi which  in accordance with the transition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas will not be amortized 
in addition  we recorded million in estimated value of identifiable intangible assets 
the purchase price was subject to certain post closing adjustments  a contingent payment of up to million by us to schlumberger and additional contingent payments by us based on the realization of certain tax benefits by us over the next years 
in march  we purchased oec compression corporation oec in an all stock transaction for approximately million  including the assumption and payment of approximately million of oec indebtedness 
we paid an aggregate of approximately  shares of hanover common stock to stockholders of oec 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is included in our financial statements commencing in april in september  we acquired the compression services division of dresser rand company for million in cash and common stock  subject to certain post closing adjustments pursuant to the acquisition agreement which to date have resulted in an increase in the purchase price to approximately million due to increases in net assets acquired 
in july  we acquired pamco services international for approximately million in cash and notes 
in june  the we acquired applied process solutions  inc for approximately  shares of our common stock 
these acquisitions were included in the results of operations from their respective acquisition dates

in addition  in  we determined to restate our financials for the years ended december   and accordingly  revenues  expenses income before taxes  net income and earnings per share have been restated for the years ended december   and see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and accounting policies  including those related to bad debts  inventories  fixed assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  sale and leaseback transactions  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this process form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and these differences can be material to our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
allowances and reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and  we recorded approximately million  million and million in additional allowances for doubtful accounts  respectively 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets and investments we review for the impairment of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangibles and investments in non consolidated affiliates whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair market value and is charged to the period in which the impairment occurred 
in addition  goodwill is evaluated at least annually pursuant to the requirements of sfas  to determine if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net carrying value of the reporting unit  including the applicable goodwill 
the estimates of fair market value is based upon management s estimates of the present value of future cash flows 
management makes assumptions regarding the estimated cash flows and if these estimates or their related assumptions change  an impairment charge may be incurred 
we capitalize major improvements that we believe extend the useful life of an asset 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
interest is capitalized during the fabrication period of compression equipment and facilities that are fabricated for use in our rental operations 
the capitalized interest is recorded as part of the basis of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas that relate to our business  one of which is publicly traded and may experience volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
tax assets hanover must estimate its expected future taxable income in order to assess the realizability of its deferred income tax assets 
as of december   hanover reported a net deferred tax liability of million  which included gross deferred tax assets of million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income  including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events  such as future operating conditions and future financial conditions 
additionally  hanover must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets  if management has the ability to implement these strategies and the expectation of implementing these strategies if the forecasted conditions actually occurred 
the principal tax planning strategy available to hanover relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered annually to give effect to changes in hanover s businesses and in its tax profile 
sale and leaseback transactions since  we have entered into five sale and leaseback transactions of compression equipment with special purpose entities 
these sale and leaseback transactions are evaluated for lease classification in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  sfas 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the special purpose entities are not included in our consolidated financial statements when the owners of the special purpose entities have made a substantial residual equity investment of at least three percent of the total capital of the entity that is at risk during the entire term of the lease 
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to 
estimate the remaining life of the asset at lease inception  
estimate the fair market value of the asset at lease inception  
estimate the leased equipment s residual value at the end of the lease  
estimate certain costs to be incurred by us in connection with the lease  
estimate the present value of the lease payments under the lease  and 
confirm that the substantial residual equity investment of at least three percent of the total capital of the entity continues to be at risk during the entire term of the lease 
if these estimates were materially incorrect  we could be required to include the special purpose entities and the related compression equipment and debt in our financial statements 
we treat the leases as operating leases for financial accounting purposes  but as financing arrangements for federal income tax and certain other tax purposes 
in addition  because we sold the compressors to the special purpose entities  our depreciation expense was reduced by approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also believe that these transactions had the effect of decreasing interest expense 
however  we believe the decreased interest expense and the increased leasing expense are not directly comparable because the duration of our compression equipment leases are longer than the maturity of our revolving line of credit 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin will require us to include in our consolidated financial statements the special purpose entities that lease compression equipment to us beginning in july if we were required to consolidate the special purpose entities as of december   we would add approximately  million in compressor equipment and approximately  million in debt to our balance sheet and we would reverse million of the deferred gains which were recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the sale and leaseback transactions 
in addition  hanover would record depreciation expense on the compression equipment for prior periods net of tax as part of the cumulative effect of the adoption of fin we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of recording depreciation for prior periods 
after we adopt fin  we estimate that we will record approximately million per year in additional depreciation expense on our leased compression equipment 
see leasing transactions for more information on these sale and leaseback transactions 
revenue recognition percentage of completion accounting we recognize revenue and profit for our fabrication operations as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made and since the fabrication projects usually last several months 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
examples of factors that would give rise to revisions include variances in the actual or revisions to the estimated costs of components  labor or other fabrication costs 
the average duration of these projects is four to six months 
as of december   we had recognized approximately million in costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
we estimate percentage of completion for compressor and processing equipment fabrication on a direct labor hour to total labor hour basis 
this requires management to estimate the number of total labor hours required for each project and to estimate the profit expected on the project 
production equipment fabrication percentage of completion is estimated using the cost to total cost basis 
this requires us to estimate the number of total costs labor and materials required to complete each project 
since we have many fabrication projects in process at any given time  we do not believe that materially different results would be achieved if different estimates  assumptions  or conditions were used for each project 
contingencies and litigation due to the restatement of our financial statements and in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various pending or threatened legal actions 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions  we are required to record a loss during the period in which we  based on our experience  believe a contingency is likely to result in a financial loss to us 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our total revenues decreased by million  or  to  million during the year ended december  from  million during  as declining revenues in our fabrication businesses more than offset increases in revenues from our domestic and international rental revenues 
revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during domestic revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during international rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase in both domestic and international rental revenues resulted from expansion of our rental fleet and business acquisitions completed in during  we completed two significant acquisitions in march  we acquired oec compression corporation which increased our rental fleet by approximately  horsepower  and in august  we acquired production operators corporation which increased our rental fleet by approximately  horsepower 
the increase in international rental revenues was offset in part by decreased revenues from our venezuelan operations 
in december  certain opposition groups in venezuela initiated an unofficial national strike 
this has caused economic conditions in venezuela to deteriorate  including a substantial reduction in the production of oil in venezuela 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  our international rental revenues were decreased by approximately million as a result of the disruption in our operations in venezuela 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding receivables related to our venezuelan operations 
at december   the compressor rental fleet consisted of approximately  horsepower  a increase over the  horsepower in the rental fleet at december  domestic horsepower in the rental fleet decreased by to  horsepower at december  from approximately  horsepower at december  and international horsepower increased by to  horsepower at december  from approximately  horsepower at december  revenues from parts  service and used equipment increased by million  or to million during from million during this increase was due to a million gas plant sale transaction and a million compression equipment sale transaction offset by lower revenues as a result of weaker market conditions 
revenues from compressor and accessory fabrication decreased by million  or  to million during from million during during  an aggregate of approximately  horsepower of compression equipment was fabricated and sold compared to approximately  horsepower fabricated and sold during in addition   horsepower was fabricated and placed in the rental fleet during compared to  horsepower in revenues from production and processing equipment fabrication decreased by million  or  to million during from million during in july  we increased our ownership of belleli energy srl to from by converting a million loan to belleli into additional equity ownership 
in november  we increased our ownership to by exchanging a million loan to the other principal owner of belleli for additional equity ownership and began consolidating the results of belleli s operations 
production and processing equipment revenues include million in revenues from the consolidation of belleli since november  excluding belleli  revenues from our fabrication businesses declined by due to decreased capital spending by our customers in caused by weak economic market conditions and recent political and economic events in south america resulting in lower drilling and new well completion activity by oil and gas producers 
the average north and south american rig count decreased by in to  from  in and the twelve month rolling average henry hub natural gas price decreased to per mcf in december from per mcf in december equity in earnings in subsidiaries increased million  or  to million during  from million during this increase is primarily due to our acquisition of poi  which included interests in three joint venture projects in south america 
these joint ventures contributed million in equity earnings for compared to million in and was partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from hanover measurement services company lp which decreased to a loss of million in from million in income in expenses operating expenses from domestic rentals increased by million or to million during from million during operating expenses from international rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase in rental expenses resulted primarily from the increased rental business and the corresponding and increase in domestic and international rental revenues  respectively  over revenues for the corresponding period in the gross profit percentage from domestic and international rentals was approximately and  respectively during and and  respectively in the decrease in domestic rentals gross profit percentage was primarily due to weaker domestic market conditions 
the increase in international rentals gross profit percentage was due to the increase in revenues for the year without a corresponding increase in expenses 
operating expenses of our parts  service and used equipment segment increased by million  or to million  during  compared to million in  which partially relates to the increase in parts  service and used equipment revenue 
the gross profit margin from parts  service and used equipment was during down from in in  parts and service revenue included million in used equipment sales at a gross margin  compared to million in  with a gross margin 
approximately of the decrease in gross profit margin for parts  service and used equipment was due to a low margin gas plant sale transaction and a low margin compressor sale transaction 
in addition  approximately of the decrease in gross margin was due to million in inventory write downs and reserves for parts which were either obsolete  excess or carried at a price above market value 
the remainder of the decrease was primarily due to the impact of weaker market conditions on sales volume and margins 
excluding the write downs and the gas plant and compression equipment transaction  the gross profit margin from parts  service and used equipment would have been during operating expenses of compressor fabrication decreased by million  or  to million during from million during  commensurate with the decrease in compressor fabrication business and revenue 
the gross profit margin on compression fabrication was during down from in the operating expenses attributable to production equipment fabrication decreased by million  or  to million during from million during the gross profit margin attributable to production and processing equipment fabrication was during down from in the decrease in gross profit margin for compression and accessory fabrication and production and processing equipment fabrication was attributable to lower sales levels without a corresponding decrease in overhead and the impact of weaker market conditions on sales margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase is attributable to increased personnel and other selling and administrative activity in our business segments resulting from the acquisitions completed during in addition  we recorded million in employee separation costs relating to a reduction in our work force and management changes and approximately million in additional legal and accounting costs  a significant portion of which was associated with our board of directors and special litigation committee review of certain transactions  the restatement of our financial results and the securities and exchange commission investigation 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during compared to million during during we recorded a million charge included in depreciation and amortization expense for reductions in the carrying value of certain idle compression equipment that is being retired and the acceleration of depreciation related to certain plants and facilities expected to be sold or abandoned 
the remaining increase in depreciation was due to the additions to the rental fleet  partially offset by the change in estimated lives of certain compressors 
after a review of the estimated economic lives of our compression fleet  on july  we changed our estimate of the useful life of certain compression equipment to range from to years instead of a uniform year depreciable life 
our new estimated lives are based upon our experience  maintenance program and the different types of compressors presently in our rental fleet 
we believe our new estimate reflects the economic useful lives of the compressors more accurately than a uniform useful life applied to all compressors regardless of their age or performance characteristics 
the effect of this change in estimate on was a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million per share 
in addition  because we sold compressors in sale leaseback transactions  depreciation expense was reduced by approximately million in compared to approximately million in the decrease in depreciation in from was due to the company s change in estimate of useful lives of its compressors on july   which is discussed above 
the increase in depreciation was also offset by the decrease in goodwill amortization due to our adoption of sfas under sfas  amortization of goodwill over an estimated useful life is discontinued 
instead  goodwill amounts will be subject to a fair value based annual impairment assessment 
during  approximately million in goodwill amortization was recorded 
we incurred leasing expense of million during compared to million during the increase of million was attributable to the compression equipment leases we entered into in august in connection with these leases  we were obligated to prepare registration statements and complete an exchange offer to enable the holders of the notes issued by the lessors to exchange their notes for notes which are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
because the exchange offer was not completed until march   we were required to pay additional leasing expense in the amount of approximately  per week until march  the additional leasing expense began accruing on january  in  we recorded additional leasing expense of approximately million related to the registration and exchange offering obligations 
interest expense increased by million to million during from million during the increase in interest expense is due to higher levels of outstanding debt partially offset by lower effective interest rates 
foreign currency translation expense increased by million  or  to million during compared to million during the increase was primarily due to our operations in argentina and venezuela 
in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on funds transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts can either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement is reached  a preliminary payment may be made based on a dollar to peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also required the parties to such contracts to renegotiate the price terms within days of the devaluation 
we have renegotiated ten of eleven of our agreements in argentina and expect to renegotiate the remaining agreement in the near future 
we do not expect that the outcome of the renegotiation of the remaining agreement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
as a result of these negotiations  we received approximately million in partial reimbursements and expect to receive approximately million in early we recorded million of these partial reimbursements in translation expense and million in revenues from international rentals 
during  we recorded an exchange loss of approximately million and million for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina and venezuela  respectively  and recorded a translation loss of approximately million for all other countries 
the fair value of our derivative instruments interest rate swaps increased by million during while the fair value decreased by million in this was due to the recognition of an unrealized change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps which we have not designated as cash flow hedges under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
due to a downturn in our business and changes in the business environment in which we operate  we completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of june  as a result of the test performed as of june   we recorded an estimated million impairment of goodwill attributable to our production and processing equipment fabrication business in the second quarter of the second step of the impairment test required us to allocate the fair value of the production and processing equipment business to its assets 
we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of and determined that no adjustment to the impairment  recorded in the second quarter  was required 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the expected present value of future cash flows and the market approach  which uses actual market sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we also recorded a million goodwill impairment related to our pump division which is expected to be sold in other expenses increased million  or  to million during compared to million during other expense in included million of write downs and charges related to investments in four non consolidated affiliates which have experienced a decline in value which we believe to be other than temporary  a million write off of a purchase option for an acquisition which we have abandoned  million in other non operating costs and a million write down of notes receivable including a million reserve established for loans to employees who are not executive officers 
other expense in included a million bridge loan commitment fee associated with hanover s recent acquisition of poi  a million write down of an investment in aurion technologies  inc  a million litigation settlement and million in other non operating expenses 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by million  or  to a tax benefit of million during from million of tax expense during the decrease resulted primarily from the corresponding decrease in income before income taxes 
the average effective income tax rates during and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge  us impact of foreign operations  and valuation allowances against certain net operating losses 
the effective tax rate benefited from non us foreign exchange losses deductible for tax in excess of book losses 
discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  the company reviewed its business lines and the board of directors approved management s recommendation to exit and sell the company s non oilfield power generation and certain used equipment business lines 
in the fourth quarter  hanover recorded a pre tax charge of million million  net of tax to write down its investment in discontinued operations to current estimated fair market values 
in addition  these operations recorded approximately million million  net of tax in write downs which were recorded in the second quarter of discontinued operations include three non oilfield power generation projects in california and related inventory  and certain of the company s used equipment divisions 
hanover anticipates selling these assets in income loss from discontinued operations decreased million  or  to a net loss of million during from net income of million during the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to weaker market conditions which impacted sales volume and gross margins 
net income loss net income loss decreased million  or  to a net loss of million during from net income of million during primarily due to i the decline in market conditions which impacted our compressor and accessory fabrication and production and processing equipment sales and gross profits  ii a million pre tax inventory write down  iii a million charge included in depreciation and amortization expense for reductions in the carrying value of certain idle units of the company s compression fleet that are being retired and the acceleration of depreciation related to certain plants and facilities expected to be sold or abandoned  iv an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation expense  leasing expense  foreign currency translation expense and interest expense and v a million goodwill impairment and vi a million charge to write down investments in discontinued operations to their estimated fair market values 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our total revenues increased by million  or  to  million during the year ended december  from million during the increase in revenues resulted from growth in horsepower of our natural gas compressor rental fleet  internal growth in our fabrication business and outsourcing businesses  which includes compression  gas treating  process measurement and oilfield power generation  as well as growth due to business acquisitions completed in and revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during domestic revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during international rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase in both domestic and international rental revenue resulted from expansion of our rental fleet and business acquisitions completed in and at december   the compressor rental fleet consisted of approximately  horsepower  a increase over the  horsepower in the rental fleet at december  domestically  the rental fleet increased by  horsepower  or  during and internationally by  horsepower  or 
revenue from parts  service and used equipment increased by million  or to million during from million during this increase is due in part to an increase in our marketing focus for this business segment  as well as expansion of business activities through acquisitions 
approximately of the increase in parts  service and used equipment revenues resulted from business acquisitions 
revenues from compressor fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during approximately of this increase is due to the acquisition of dresser rand company s compression service division in september and poi acquisition in august during  an aggregate of approximately  horsepower of compression equipment was fabricated and sold compared to approximately  horsepower fabricated and sold during in addition   horsepower was fabricated and placed in the rental fleet during compared to  horsepower in revenues from production and processing equipment fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during of this increase is due to the acquisition of apsi during june and the remainder of the increase is due to an improvement in market conditions in the process equipment business compared to conditions which existed in equity in earnings in subsidiaries increased million  or  to million during  from million during this increase is primarily due to our acquisition of poi  which included interests in three joint venture projects in south america 
these joint ventures contributed million in equity earnings for which was partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from collicutt hanover mechanical services which decreased to a loss of  in from  in income in expenses operating expenses of the rental segments increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase resulted primarily from the corresponding increase in revenues from rentals over the corresponding period in the gross profit percentage from rentals was approximately during and operating expenses of our parts  service and used equipment segment increased by million  or to million  during  compared to million in  which relates to the increase in parts  service and used equipment revenue 
the gross profit margin from parts  service and used equipment was during and during operating expenses of compressor fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during  commensurate with the increase in compressor fabrication business and revenue 
the gross profit margin on compression fabrication was during and during the operating expenses attributable to production equipment fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during the gross profit margin attributable to production and processing equipment fabrication was during and during selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during from million during the increase is attributable to increased personnel and other administrative and selling expenses associated with business acquisitions completed during and as well as increased activity in the our business segments 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during compared to million during the increase in depreciation was due to the additions to the rental fleet which were partially offset by an approximately million decrease in depreciation as a result of the sale of compression equipment into the equipment leases in march  august and october and in august the increase in amortization of approximately million was due to additional goodwill recorded from business acquisitions completed during and after a review of the estimated economic lives of our compression fleet  on july  we changed our estimate of the useful life of certain compression equipment to range from to years instead of a year depreciable life 
our new estimated lives are based upon the different types of compressors presently in our rental fleet rather than a blanket life applied to all compressors  and more accurately reflects the economic lives of the compressors 
the effect of this change in estimate on the year ended december  was a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million per share 
we incurred leasing expense of million during compared to million during the increase of million resulted from the additional equipment leases entered into in and interest expense increased by million to million during from million for the the increase in interest expense is due to higher levels of outstanding debt partially offset by lower effective interest rates 
foreign currency translation expense for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to the company s operations in argentina and venezuela 
due to the currency exposure in argentina and venezuela  the company recorded an exchange loss during of approximately million and million for assets exposed to currency translation risk in these countries  respectively 
other expenses during was million  which included a million bridge loan commitment fee associated with hanover s recent acquisition of poi  a million write down of an investment in aurion technologies  inc  a million litigation settlement  and million in other non operating expenses 
the company incurred a million loss from the recognition of an unrealized loss related to the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps as required under sfas see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase resulted primarily from the corresponding increase in income before income taxes 
the average effective income tax rates during and were and  respectively 
net income net income increased million  or  to million during from million during due to the increase in revenues and gross profits discussed above 
leasing transactions off balance sheet the company has entered into five transactions involving the sale of equipment by hanover and its subsidiaries to special purpose entities  which in turn lease the equipment back to us 
at the time  these transactions had a number of advantages over other sources of capital then available to us 
the sale and leaseback transactions enabled hanover to affordably extend the duration of its financing arrangements  reduce hanover s cost of capital and provided access to a source of capital other than traditional bank financing 
prior to our first sale and leaseback transaction in  we financed growth in compression assets by drawing down on our revolving line of credit with a commercial bank 
while highly flexible and well priced  the line of credit represented a short term funding strategy to finance long term assets 
sale and leaseback transactions can reduce refinancing risk by extending the duration of our capital commitments 
sale and leaseback transactions also provided capital to us at a lower cost compared to other sources then available to us 
lenders to the special purpose entities did not require as high a rate of interest because their capital risk is mitigated by a perfected  first priority security interest in the compression equipment  as well as a residual value guarantee provided by us 
this had the effect of reducing our leasing expense relative to an unsecured borrowing rate 
based on our periodic review of capital alternatives  we believe that the cost of our rent payments in the sale and lease back transactions historically has been less than the cost of debt financing alternatives available to us at the time we entered into these sale and leaseback transactions 
we will continue to evaluate sale leaseback transactions as well as consider other forms of financing for cost effectiveness as future capital needs arise 
we also believe that the sale and leaseback transactions represent a source of capital in addition to the commercial bank financing traditionally utilized by us 
this diversification of our capital sources has broadened our access to capital and allowed us to expand operations 
in august and in connection with the poi acquisition  we completed two sale and leaseback transactions involving certain compression equipment 
concurrent with these transactions  we exercised our purchase option under our july operating lease described below for million 
under one transaction  we received million proceeds from the sale of compression equipment 
under the second transaction  we received million from the sale of additional compression equipment 
both transactions are recorded as a sale and leaseback of the equipment and are recorded as operating leases 
under the first transaction  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a seven year period and will continue to be deployed by us in the normal course of our business 
the agreement calls for semi annual rental payments of approximately million in addition to quarterly rental payments of approximately  under the second transaction  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a ten year period and will continue to be deployed by us in the normal course of our business 
the agreement calls for semi annual rental payments of approximately million in addition to quarterly rental payments of approximately  we have options to repurchase the equipment under certain conditions as defined by the lease agreements 
through december   we incurred transaction costs of approximately million related to these transactions 
these costs are included in intangible and other assets and are being amortized over the respective lease terms 
in october  we completed a million sale and leaseback of compression equipment 
in march  we entered into a separate million sale and leaseback of compression equipment 
under the march agreement  we received proceeds of million from the sale of compression equipment at the first closing in march and in august  we completed the second half of the equipment lease and received an additional million for the sale of additional compression equipment 
in june and in july  we completed two other separate million sale and leaseback transactions of compression equipment 
under the lease agreements  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a five year term and will be utilized by us in our business 
we have options to repurchase the equipment under the and leases as defined under certain conditions by the lease agreement 
the lease agreements call for variable quarterly payments that fluctuate with the london interbank offering rate and have covenant restrictions similar to our bank credit facility 
we incurred an aggregate of approximately million in transactions costs for the leases entered into in and  which are included in intangible and other assets on the balance sheet and are being amortized over the respective lease terms of the respective transactions 
the following table summarizes the proceeds  net book value of equipment sold  deferred gain on equipment sale  the residual guarantee maximum exposure to loss and the lease termination date for equipment leases in thousands of dollars residual sale net book deferred value lease lease proceeds value gain guarantee termination date june     june march and august     march october     october august     september august     september these transactions are recorded as a sale and leaseback of the equipment and the leases are treated as operating leases 
we made residual value guarantees under the lease agreements that are due upon termination of the leases and which may be satisfied by a cash payment or the exercise of our equipment purchase options under the terms of the lease agreements 
the residual value guarantees and other lease terms which are based on negotiation between hanover and third party lessors  were supported by equipment appraisals and analysis 
we believe that the market value of the equipment at the end of the lease will exceed the guaranteed residual values due to our predictive and preventive maintenance programs  routine overhaul practices and the expected demand for compression equipment in the future 
we review the value of the equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in market value may have occurred as a result of foreseeable obsolescence or a decrease in market demand 
if the fair value of the equipment was less than the guaranteed residual value  we would accrue additional lease expense for the amount that would be payable upon termination of the lease 
all gains on the sale of the equipment are deferred until the end of the respective lease terms 
should we not exercise our purchase options under the lease agreements  the deferred gains will be recognized to the extent they exceed any final rent payments and any other payments required under the lease agreements 
as a result of the lease transactions  we incurred approximately million  million  and million in lease expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following future minimum lease payments are due under our compressor leasing arrangements exclusive of any final rent payments or purchase option payments in thousands      and  thereafter 
in connection with the equipment leases entered into in august  we were obligated to prepare registration statements and complete an exchange offering to enable the holders of the notes issued by the lessors to exchange their notes with notes which are registered under the securities act of because of the restatement of our financial statements  the exchange offering was not completed pursuant to the deadline required by the agreement and we were required to pay additional lease expense in the amount equal to  per week until the exchange offering was completed 
the additional lease expense began accruing on january  and increased our lease expense by million during the registration statements became effective in february the exchange offer was completed and the requirement to pay the additional lease expense ended on march  liquidity and capital resources our cash balance amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  primary sources of cash during the year ended december  were cash flow from operations 
principal uses of cash during the year ended december  were capital expenditures of million and business acquisitions of million 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of a reduction in account receivables related to lower operating levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of we invested million in property  plant and equipment in and added approximately  net horsepower to our rental fleet 
at december   the compressor rental fleet consisted of  horsepower domestically and  horsepower in the international rental fleet 
given our consistently high compressor rental fleet utilization  we carry out new customer projects through fleet additions and other related capital expenditures 
we generally invest funds necessary to make these rental fleet additions when our idle equipment cannot economically fulfill a project s requirements and the new equipment expenditure is matched with long term contracts whose expected economic terms exceed our return on capital targets 
during  we plan to spend approximately to million on rental equipment fleet additions  including million on equipment overhauls and other maintenance capital 
a recent amendment to our revolving credit agreement restricts our capital spending to million in we expect that our capital spending will be within operating cash flows 
historically  we have funded capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated cash flow  borrowing under the revolving credit facility  sale and leaseback transactions  raising additional equity and issuing long term debt 
we believe that cash flow from operations and borrowing under our existing million bank credit facility will provide us with adequate capital resources to fund our estimated level of capital expenditures for the short term 
since capital expenditures are largely discretionary  we believe we would be able to significantly reduce them  in a reasonably short time frame  if expected cash flows from operations are not realized 
as of december   we had approximately million in borrowings and approximately million in letters of credit outstanding on our million revolving bank credit facility weighted average effective rate at december  
the letters of credit expire between and in addition  we had approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under other letters of credit facilities which expire during our bank credit facility permits us to incur indebtedness  subject to covenant limitations  up to a million credit limit  plus  in addition to certain other indebtedness  an additional million in subordinated unsecured indebtedness and million of other unsecured indebtedness 
in addition  our bank credit facility permits us to enter into future sale and leaseback transactions with respect to equipment having a value not in excess of million 
in addition to purchase money and similar obligations  the indentures and the participation agreements  which are part of our compression equipment leases  permit us to incur indebtedness up to the million credit limit under our bank credit facility  plus an additional million in unsecured indebtedness and any additional indebtedness so long as  after incurring such indebtedness  our ratio of the sum of consolidated net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization of intangibles  certain other non cash charges and rental expense to total fixed charges all as defined and adjusted by the agreements  or hanover s coverage ratio  is greater than to the indentures and participation agreements define indebtedness to include the present value of our rental obligations under sale and leaseback transactions and under facilities similar to our compression equipment leases 
in february  we executed an amendment to our bank credit facility and certain compression equipment leases that we entered into in and the amendment  which was effective as of december   modified certain financial covenants to allow us greater flexibility in accessing the capacity under the bank credit facility to support our short term liquidity needs 
in addition  at the higher end of our permitted consolidated leverage ratio  the amendment would increase the commitment fee under the bank credit facility by and increase the interest rate margins used to calculate the applicable interest rates under all of the agreements by up to 
any increase in our interest costs as a result of the amendment will depend on our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter  the amount of indebtedness outstanding and the interest rate quoted for the benchmark selected by us 
as part of the amendment  we granted the lenders under these agreements a security interest in the inventory  equipment and certain other property of hanover and its domestic subsidiaries  and pledged of the equity interest in certain of hanover s foreign subsidiaries 
in consideration for obtaining the amendment  we agreed to pay approximately million in fees to the lenders under these agreements 
during  we obtained waivers and amendments to our bank credit facility and certain compression equipment leases to cure non compliance with covenants in those agreements largely resulting from the april restatement of our consolidated financial statements 
these waivers and amendments did not result in any material adverse consequences to our business 
in february  moody s investor service announced that it had downgraded by one grade our senior implied credit rating  our convertible senior notes and our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities to ba  b and b  respectively  and standard poor s rating service announced that it had lowered our corporate credit rating to bb 
we do not have any credit rating downgrade provisions in our debt or equipment lease agreements that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt or rental obligations 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could materially and adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
should this occur  we might seek alternative sources of funding 
as of december   after giving effect to the amendment made in february  which was effective as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in our bank credit facility  compression equipment leases and indentures 
giving effect to the covenant limitations in our bank credit agreement  as amended to date  the liquidity available under our revolver at december  was approximately million 
as of december   our debt to capitalization ratio  including the residual value guarantees under our compression equipment leases  was to and our book debt to capitalization ratio  excluding compression equipment leases  was 
to based upon our total debt of approximately million at december   we expect total debt service payments for the year ending december  will be approximately million based upon interest rates in effect as of december  in addition  based upon our current operating lease commitments and rates in effect at december   we expect that total compressor lease rent payments for the year ending december  will be approximately million 
we also expect that total distributions on our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities for the year ended december  assuming no deferrals as permitted by the terms of such securities to be approximately million 
as part of our business  we are a party to various financial guarantees  performance guarantees and other contractual commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries  investees and other third parties 
to varying degrees  these guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
the possibility of us having to honor our contingencies is largely dependent upon future operations of various subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
we would record a reserve for these guarantees if events occurred that required that one be established 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

in the event of an event of default under note  interest will accrue at a rate of above the then applicable rate 
the note is subordinated to all of the company s indebtedness other than indebtedness to fund future acquisitions 
in the event that the company completes an offering of equity securities  the company is required to apply the proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under the note as long as no default exists or would exist under our other indebtedness as a result of such payment 
as of december   we were required to pay million plus accrued interest to schlumberger upon obtaining financing of a south american joint venture  a minority interest of which was acquired by hanover in the acquisition of poi 
the million obligation is included in accrued liabilities in our balance sheet 
because the joint venture failed to obtain the financing on or before december   we had the right to put our interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger in exchange for a return of the purchase price allocated to the joint venture  plus the net amount of any capital contributions by hanover to the joint venture 
in january  we exercised our right to put our interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger 
if not exercised  the put right would have expired as of february  the consummation of the transfer of hanover s interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger is subject to certain consents 
hanover is currently in discussions with schlumberger to explore the possibility of entering into a new agreement under which hanover would retain the ownership interest in the joint venture 
in light of the ongoing discussions between hanover and schlumberger relating to the put  the parties have agreed to postpone the closing date to no later than may  we are a guarantor of approximately million of debt associated with the special purpose entities with which we entered into sale leaseback transactions 
the amount of these guarantees are equal to the residual value guarantees under the compression equipment lease agreements 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments to minimize the risks and or costs associated with financial and global operating activities by managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuation on a portion of its variable rate debt and leasing obligations 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the cash flow from hedges is classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows under the same category as the cash flows from the underlying assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions 
we adopted sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  effective january  sfas requires that all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and that changes in such fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
changes in the values of derivatives that meet these hedging criteria will ultimately offset related earnings effects of the hedged item pending recognition in earnings 
prior to  we entered into two interest rate swaps which were outstanding at september  with notional amounts of million and million and strike rates of and  respectively 
these swaps were to expire in july  however  they were extended for an additional two years at the option of the counterparty and now expire in july the difference paid or received on the swap transactions is recorded as an accrued lease liability and is recognized in leasing expense 
on january   in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas  we recorded a loss resulting from the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the statement of operations of approximately  net of tax benefit of  during the year ended december  and  we recognized an unrealized gain of approximately million and an additional unrealized loss of approximately million  respectively  related to the change in the fair value of these interest rate swaps in the statement of operations because these swaps did not meet the specific hedge criteria as a result of the counterparty s option to extend the interest rate swaps 
further  management decided not to designate the interest rate swaps as hedges at the time they were extended by the counterparty 
at december   we recorded approximately million in accrued liabilities with respect to the fair value adjustment related to these interest rate swaps 
the fair value of these interest rate swaps will fluctuate with changes in interest rates over their remaining terms and the fluctuations will be recorded in the statement of operations 
during the second quarter of  we entered into three additional interest rate swaps to convert variable lease payments under certain lease arrangements to fixed payments as follows maturity strike notional lease date rate amount march  august  october  these three swaps  which we have designated as cash flow hedging instruments  meet the specific hedge criteria and any changes in their fair values have been recognized in other comprehensive income 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded a loss of approximately million and million  respectively  related to these three swaps  million and million  net of tax in other comprehensive income 
as of december   a total of approximately million was recorded in accrued current liabilities and approximately million in other long term liabilities with respect to the fair value adjustment related to these three swaps 
the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements are major international financial institutions 
we continually monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and do not expect non performance by any counterparty  although such non performance could have a material adverse effect on us 
in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on funds transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts can either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement is reached  a preliminary payment may be made based on a dollar to peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also requires that the parties to such contracts renegotiate the price terms within days of the devaluation 
as a result of these negotiations  we received approximately million in partial reimbursements of which million are recorded in revenue  and expect to receive approximately million during we have renegotiated ten of eleven of our agreements in argentina and expect to renegotiate the remaining agreement in the near future 
we do not expect that the outcome of the renegotiation of the remaining agreement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
during the year ended december   we recorded an exchange loss of approximately million for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina 
for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross margin 
the economic situation in argentina is subject to change 
to the extent that the situation in argentina continues to deteriorate  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso against the dollar is reduced further  our results of operations in argentina could be materially and adversely affected which could result in reductions in our net income 
in addition  we have exposure to currency risks in venezuela 
to mitigate that risk  the majority of our existing contracts provide that we receive payment in us dollars rather than venezuelan bolivars  thus reducing our exposure to fluctuations in the bolivar s value 
during the year ended december   we recorded an exchange loss of approximately million for assets exposed to currency translation in venezuela 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross margin 
in december  certain opposition groups in venezuela initiated an unofficial national strike 
this has caused economic conditions in venezuela to deteriorate  including a substantial reduction in the production of oil in venezuela 
in addition  exchange controls have been put in place which put limitations on the amount of venezuelan currency which can be exchanged for foreign currency by businesses operating inside venezuela 
if the national strike continues  exchange controls remain in place  or economic conditions in venezuela continue to deteriorate  hanover s results of operations in venezuela could be materially and adversely affected  which could result in reductions in hanover s net income 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  our international rental revenues were decreased by approximately million a result of the disruption in our operations in venezuela 
factors that may affect our financial condition and future results risks related to our business substantial capital requirements we require a substantial amount of capital to expand our compressor rental fleet and our complementary businesses 
during we plan to spend approximately to million  in continued expansion and maintenance of our rental fleet and other businesses  including million on equipment overhauls and other maintenance capital 
we expect that our capital spending will be within our operating cash flows 
the amount of these expenditures may vary depending on conditions in the natural gas industry and the timing and extent of any significant acquisitions we may make 
historically  we have funded our capital expenditures through internally generated funds  sale and leaseback transactions and debt and equity financing 
while we believe that cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our existing million bank credit agreement will provide us with sufficient cash to fund our planned capital expenditures in the short term  we cannot assure you that these sources will be sufficient 
as of december   we had approximately million of credit capacity remaining after giving effect to the covenant limitations in the agreement on our million bank credit agreement weighted average effective interest rate at december  
failure to generate sufficient cash flow  together with the absence of alternative sources of capital  could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
substantial debt and operating leases we have a substantial amount of debt and compression equipment lease commitments 
our current debt level could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure during adverse economic conditions 
as of december   we had approximately million in total residual value guarantees that are due upon termination of our compression equipment leases and may be satisfied by a cash payment or the exercise of our purchase options under the terms of the respective lease agreements and approximately million of debt outstanding 
our substantial debt and compression equipment lease commitments could have important consequences to you 
for example  these commitments could 
make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  
increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  
increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on a portion of our debt are at variable rates  
limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  
place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or operating lease commitments  and 
limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
additionally  the indenture  the participation agreement and other documents governing our compression equipment leases contain financial and other restrictive covenants 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our bank credit facility and other debt facilities and the operative documents governing our compression equipment leases contain  among other things  covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
these covenants include provisions that restrict our ability to 
incur additional indebtedness or issue guarantees  
create liens on our assets  
engage in mergers  consolidations and certain dispositions of assets  
enter into additional operating leases  
pay dividends on or redeem capital stock  
enter into derivative transactions  
make certain investments or restricted payments  
make certain investments  loans or advancements to certain of our subsidiaries  
prepay or modify our debt facilities  
enter into transactions with affiliates  or 
enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
in addition  under the bank credit facility  we have granted the lenders a security interest in the inventory  equipment and certain other property of hanover and its domestic subsidiaries  and pledged of the equity interest in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
our bank credit facility and other debt facilities and the operative documents governing our compression equipment leases require us to maintain financial ratios and tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
adverse conditions in the oil and gas business or in the world economy or other events related to our business may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants or failure to maintain such financial ratios would result in an event default under our debt facilities and our compression equipment leases 
if such an event of default occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
we have approximately million of indebtedness which will mature within two years from december  our ability to refinance this indebtedness will be affected by the factors discussed above and those discussed under the heading significant leverage below and by the general market at the time we refinance 
the factors discussed above and those discussed under the heading significant leverage below could adversely affect our ability to refinance this indebtedness at a reasonable cost 
significant leverage we have significant leverage relative to our total capitalization  which could result in a further downgrade in our credit rating if we do not reduce our leverage 
as of december   our debt to capitalization ratio  including residual value guarantees under our compression equipment leases  was to and our book debt to capitalization ratio  excluding our compression equipment leases  was to we have been advised by moody s investor service that our credit rating may suffer further if we are unable to materially reduce our leverage during the first half of in february  moody s investor service announced that it had downgraded by one grade our senior implied credit rating  our convertible senior notes and our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities to ba  b and b  respectively  and standard poor s rating service announced that it had lowered our corporate credit rating to bb 
we do not have any rating downgrade provisions that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt if our credit rating was downgraded 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities 
our ability to reduce our leverage depends upon market and economic conditions  as well as our ability to execute liquidity enhancing transactions such as sales of non core assets or our equity securities 
significant cash requirements we will need to generate a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and operating lease commitments and to fund working capital 
our ability to make scheduled payments under our compressor equipment leases and indebtedness  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to our operational performance  as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory conditions  among other factors 
based upon our total debt of million at december   we expect total debt service payments for the year ended december  will be approximately million based upon interest rates in effect as of december  in addition  based upon our current operating lease commitments and rates in effect at december   we expect that total compressor lease rent payments for the year ended december  will be approximately million 
we also expect that total distributions on our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities for the year ended december  assuming no deferrals as permitted by the terms of such securities will be approximately million 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate revolving credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding under this facility bearing interest at a weighted average effective rate of per annum 
assuming a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in this rate and that the amount outstanding under this facility remains constant  annual interest expense for advances under this facility would increase or decrease by million 
in addition  we are exposed to variable rental rates on the equipment leases we entered into in june and october assuming a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in rates from those in effect at december   the increase or decrease in leasing expense for the next twelve months on these equipment leases would be approximately million 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under our million bank credit agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  operating lease commitments  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms could materially adversely affect our business 
short lease terms many of our compressor leases with customers have short initial terms  and we cannot be sure that the leases for these rental compressors will be renewed after the end of the initial lease term 
the length of our leases varies based on operating conditions and customer needs 
in most cases  under currently prevailing lease rates  the initial lease terms are not long enough to enable us to fully recoup the average cost of acquiring or fabricating the equipment 
we cannot be sure that a substantial number of our lessees will continue to renew their leases or that we will be able to re lease the equipment to new customers or that any renewals or re leases will be at comparable lease rates 
the inability to renew or re lease a substantial portion of our compressor rental fleet would have a material adverse effect upon our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
characterization of sale leaseback transactions there is a risk that the internal revenue service or other taxing authority would not agree with our treatment of sale leaseback transactions which could increase our taxes 
we treat our sale leaseback transactions as operating leases for financial accounting purposes but as financing arrangements for income tax and certain other tax purposes 
a tax treatment inconsistent with our position could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we intend to continue to treat the leases as a secured financing arrangement for income and certain other tax purposes  which is consistent with how the leases are intended to be treated for bankruptcy law and state law purposes 
if the internal revenue service or another taxing authority were to successfully contend that the leases or any of our other operating leases should be treated as a sale and leaseback of equipment rather than a secured financing arrangement  we may owe significant additional taxes 
this result may affect our ability to make payments on our leases or debt 
see discussion of fin under new accounting pronouncements 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates sale and leaseback transactions 
lease substitutions our ability to substitute compressor equipment under our equipment leases is limited and there are risks associated with reaching that limit prior to the expiration of the lease term 
the company has entered into five transactions involving the sale of equipment by hanover and its subsidiaries to special purpose entities  which in turn lease the equipment back to us 
we are entitled under the lease agreements to substitute equipment that we own for equipment owned by the special purpose entities  provided that the value of the equipment involved in the substitutions is equal 
we generally substitute equipment when a lease customer of ours exercises a contractual right or otherwise desires to buy the leased equipment or when fleet equipment owned by the special purposes entities is selected by the company for transfer to international projects 
each lease agreement limits the aggregate amount of replacement equipment that may be substituted to a percentage of the termination value under each lease 
the termination value is equal to i the aggregate amount of outstanding principal of the corresponding notes issued by the special purpose entity  plus accrued and unpaid interest and ii the aggregate amount of equity investor contributions to the special purpose entity  plus all accrued amounts due on account of the investor yield and any other amounts owed to such investors in the special purpose entity 
in the table below termination value does not include amounts in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes and the aggregate outstanding amount of the equity investor contributions  as such amounts are periodically paid as supplemental rent as required by the compression equipment leases 
the aggregate amount of replacement equipment substituted to date in dollars and percentage of termination value  the termination value  the substitution percentage limitation relating to each of our compression equipment leases to date as of february  is as follows substitution limitation as value of percentage percentage of substituted of termination termination termination lease termination lease equipment value value value date dollars in millions june june march and august march october october august september august september total  termination value assumes all accrued rents paid before termination 
in the event we reach the substitution limitation prior to a lease termination date  we will not be able to effect any additional substitutions with respect to such lease 
this inability to substitute could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
international operations there are many risks associated with conducting operations in international markets 
we operate in many different geographic markets  some of which are outside the united states 
changes in local economic or political conditions  particularly in latin america or canada  could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities include the following 
difficulties in managing international operations  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
tariffs and other trade barriers which may restrict our ability to enter into new markets  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
restrictions on repatriation of earnings or expropriation of property  
difficulties in establishing new international offices and risks inherent in establishing new relationships in foreign countries  
the burden of complying with foreign laws  and 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the us dollar  particularly in argentina and venezuela 
in addition  our future plans involve expanding our business in foreign markets where were currently do not conduct business 
our decentralized management structure and the risks inherent in new business ventures  especially in foreign markets where local customs  laws and business procedures present special challenges  may affect our ability to be successful in these ventures or avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
operations in argentina and venezuela political conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates in argentina and venezuela could adversely affect our business 
in december  certain opposition groups in venezuela initiated an unofficial national strike 
this has caused economic conditions in venezuela to deteriorate  including a substantial reduction in the production of oil in venezuela 
in addition  exchange controls have been put in place which put limitations on the amount of venezuelan currency that can be exchanged for foreign currency by businesses operating inside venezuela 
as of december   we had approximately million in receivables from customers in venezuela  a significant portion of which were due from petroleos de venezuela  sa  venezuela s state owned oil company 
if the national strike continues  exchange controls remain in place  our receivables continue to increase and ultimately are not paid or economic conditions in venezuela continue to deteriorate  our results of operations in venezuela could be materially and adversely affected  which could result in reductions in hanover s net income 
in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on funds transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts can either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement is reached  a preliminary payment may be made based on a dollar to peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also requires the parties to such contracts to renegotiate the price terms within days of the devaluation 
we have renegotiated ten of eleven of our agreements in argentina and expect to renegotiate the remaining agreement in the near future 
we do not expect that the outcome of the renegotiation of the remaining agreement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
the economic situation in argentina is subject to change 
if the situation in argentina continues to deteriorate  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso against the dollar is reduced further  hanover s results of operations in argentina could be materially and adversely affected  which could result in reductions in hanover s net income 
as part of our acquisition of the gas compression business of schlumberger  we acquired minority interests in three joint ventures in venezuela 
as a minority investor in these joint ventures  we will not be able to control their operations and activities  including without limitation  whether and when they distribute cash or property to their holders 
integration of acquisitions integration of acquired assets into our business involves potential risks which could affect our business 
historically  we have completed selective acquisitions of other companies  assets and product lines that either complement or expand our business 
each acquisition involves potential risks  such as the diversion of management s attention away from current operations  problems in integrating acquired businesses and possible short term adverse effects on our operations as a result of that process 
we may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our business  or may be able to do so only at significant expense 
our ability to make acquisitions in will be impacted by the recent amendment to our bank credit agreement which restricts our capital spending to million in industry conditions a prolonged  substantial reduction in oil or gas prices  or prolonged instability in domestic or global energy markets  could adversely affect our business 
our operations depend upon the levels of activity in natural gas development  production  processing and transportation 
in recent years  oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity have been extremely volatile 
for example  oil and gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and gas prices or significant instability in energy markets 
as a result  the demand for our gas compression and oil and gas production equipment would be adversely affected 
any future significant  prolonged decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
erosion of the financial condition of customers could adversely affect our business 
during times when the natural gas market weakens  the likelihood of the erosion of the financial condition of these customers increases 
if and to the extent the financial condition of our customers declines  our customers could seek to preserve capital by canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing gas compression and oil and gas production equipment and determining not to purchase new gas compression and oil and gas production equipment 
in addition  upon the financial failure of a customer  we could experience a loss associated with the unsecured portion of any of our outstanding accounts receivable 
recently  due to a deterioration in market conditions  we have experienced a decline in revenues and profits 
for the year ended december   our business recorded a million net loss 
our results for the year ended december  have been impacted by i the decline in market conditions which impacted our compressor and accessory fabrication and production and processing equipment sales and gross profits  ii a million pre tax inventory write down  iii a million charge included in depreciation and amortization expense for reductions in the carrying value of certain idle units of the company s compression fleet that are being retired and the acceleration of depreciation related to certain plants and facilities expected to be sold or abandoned  iv an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation expense  leasing expense  foreign currency translation expense  interest expense  v a million pre tax goodwill impairment  primarily attributable to our production and processing equipment business and vi a million charge to write down investments in discontinued operations to their estimated fair market values 
discontinued operations our exit and sale strategy with respect to certain assets classified as discontinued operations is subject to market and execution risks 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our business lines and the board of directors approved management s recommendation to exit and sell our non oilfield power generation and certain used equipment business lines 
in the fourth quarter  hanover recorded a pre tax charge of million million  net of tax to write down its investment in discontinued operations to current estimated fair market values 
in addition  these operations recorded approximately million million  net of tax in write downs which were recorded in the second quarter of discontinued operations include three non oilfield power generation projects and related inventory  and certain of our used equipment divisions 
we anticipate selling these assets in however  our ability to sell these assets for an amount equal to their respective estimated fair market values which they are carried on our books is subject to the availability and interest of purchasers for those assets and our ability to find potential purchasers and to take advantage of any opportunities to sell these assets that may arise 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we experience competition from companies who may be able to more quickly adapt to technological and other changes within our industry and throughout the economy as a whole  more readily take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
in times of weak market conditions  we may experience reduced profit margins from increased pricing pressure 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in this market or against such competition 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share and our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
potential liability and insurance natural gas operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability to us 
natural gas operations entail inherent risks  including equipment defects  malfunctions and failures and natural disasters  which could result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids  fires and explosions 
these risks may expose us  as an equipment operator or fabricator  to liability for personal injury  wrongful death  property damage  pollution and other environmental damage 
we have obtained insurance against liability for personal injury  wrongful death and property damage  but we cannot assure you that the insurance will be adequate to cover the liability we may incur 
insurance premium pricing is highly volatile and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at a reasonable cost or at all 
our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits 
war  terrorist attacks or responses thereto the outbreak of war  terrorist attacks or responses thereto could adversely affect our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the war in iraq  unrest in the middle east and other parts of the world may result in instability in the world energy markets  affecting both supply and demand 
our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we incur substantial damages as a result of such instability 
on september   terrorists carried out attacks that destroyed the world trade center in new york and badly damaged the pentagon outside of washington  dc as a result of these attacks  the united states securities markets were closed for several days 
we believe that these events and the subsequent military actions have caused a delay in capital spending which has impacted our business 
the impact that these terrorist attacks  or future events arising as a result of these terrorist attacks  including military or police activities in the united states or the outbreak of war in foreign countries  future terrorist activities or threats of such activities  political unrest and instability  riots and protests  could have on the united states and the global economy  the united states and global securities markets and our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows cannot be determined with any accuracy 
we have not obtained insurance against terrorist attacks or responses thereto and  due to its limited availability and high cost  do not expect to obtain such insurance in the future 
our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we incur substantial damages as a result of terrorist attacks or responses thereto 
governmental regulation our business is subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment  health and safety 
our business is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment  health and safety 
these laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures  including assessment of monetary penalties  imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance 
as part of the regular overall evaluation of both our current operations and newly acquired operations  we are in the process of applying for or updating certain facility permits with respect to stormwater discharges  waste handling and air emissions relating to painting and blasting 
in addition  certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate  on behalf of a specific customer  petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units  all of which may impose additional compliance obligations 
we are evaluating the impact on our operations of recently promulgated air emission regulations relating to non road engines 
we intend to implement any equipment upgrades or permit modifications required by these air emission regulations according to the required schedule 
we do not anticipate  however  that any changes or updates in response to such regulations  or any other anticipated permit modifications for stormwater  other air emission sources or otherwise or anticipated ongoing regulatory compliance obligations will have a material adverse effect on our operations either as a result of any enforcement measures or through increased capital costs 
based on our experience to date  we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  future events  such as compliance with more stringent laws and regulations  a major expansion of our operations into more heavily regulated activities  more vigorous enforcement policies by regulatory agencies or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations could require us to make material expenditures 
we have conducted preliminary environmental site assessments with respect to some  but not all  properties currently owned or leased by us  usually in a pre acquisition context 
some of these assessments have revealed that soils and or groundwater at some of our facilities are contaminated with hydrocarbons  heavy metals and various other regulated substances 
with respect to newly acquired properties  we do not believe that our operations caused or contributed to any such contamination and we are not currently under any orders or directives to undertake any remedial activity 
we typically will develop a baseline of site conditions so we can establish conditions at the outset of our operations on such property 
however  the handling of petroleum products and other regulated substances is a normal part of our operations  and we have experienced occasional minor spills or incidental leakage in connection with our operations 
certain properties previously owned or leased by us were determined to be impacted by soil contamination 
where such contamination was identified  we have since conducted remedial activities at these previously held properties as we believed necessary to meet regulatory standards  and either sold the owned properties to third parties or returned the leased properties to the lessors 
we are not currently aware of any further remedial obligations at such previously held properties 
based on our experience to date  and the relatively minor nature of the types of contamination we have identified to date  we believe that the future cost of necessary investigation or remediation on our current properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we cannot be certain  however  that cleanup standards will not become more stringent  or that we will not be required to undertake any remedial activities involving any substantial costs on any of these current or previously held properties in the future or that the discovery of unknown contamination or third party claims made with respect to current or previously owned or leased properties may not result in substantial costs 
concentrated ownership a significant amount of our stock is owned by two stockholders 
gkh investments  lp and gkh partners lp  as nominee for gkh private limited collectively gkh  owned approximately of our common stock as of december  schlumberger and its affiliates owned approximately of our common stock as of december  as holders of large blocks of our stock  gkh and schlumberger are in a position to exert substantial influence over the outcome of many corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  the additional issuance of our common stock or other securities and transactions involving a change of control 
the interests of gkh or schlumberger could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
gkh has advised us that it is in the process of dissolving and winding up its affairs 
on november   gkh informed us that it had advised its limited partners that it is extending the wind up process of the partnership for an additional twelve months from january  until january  on december   gkh made a partial distribution of  shares out of a total of  shares held by gkh to its limited and general partners 
as part of the wind up process  gkh may liquidate or distribute substantially all of its assets  including the remaining shares of our common stock owned by gkh  to its partners 
in the event the partners of gkh receive further distributions of shares of our common stock from gkh as a result of the wind up  we cannot predict whether those partners would continue to hold those shares or whether the interests of such partners may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and the holders of the notes 
hanover acquired its interest in pigap ii as part of its purchase of production operators corporation from schlumberger in august pigap ii is a joint venture  currently owned by a subsidiary of williams companies inc and by hanover  which operates a natural gas compression facility in venezuela that processes billion standard cubic feet per day of natural gas 
the natural gas processed by pigap ii is re injected into oil reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery 
in january  we exercised our right to put our interest in one of these joint ventures  the pigap ii joint venture  back to schlumberger 
if not exercised  the put right would have expired as of february  the consummation of the transfer of the company s interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger is subject to certain consents 
we are currently in discussions with schlumberger to explore the possibility of entering into a new agreement under which we would retain the ownership interest in the joint venture 
in light of the ongoing discussions between hanover and schlumberger relating to the put  the parties have agreed to postpone the closing date to no later than may  shareholder litigation we and certain of our officers and directors are named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit and in various derivative lawsuits 
the putative class action securities lawsuits and the derivative lawsuits that we are currently defending are at a very early stage 
consequently  it is premature at this time to predict liability or to estimate the damages  or the range of damages  if any  that we might incur in connection with such actions 
as of december   the company has paid approximately million in legal related expenses in connection with the internal investigations  the putative class action securities lawsuits  the derivative lawsuits and the securities and exchange commission investigation 
of this amount  the company has paid approximately on behalf of officers and directors in connection with the above named proceedings 
the company intends to pay the litigation expenses of its officers and directors  subject to the limitations imposed by delaware law and the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
the company expects to be reimbursed for some or all of these expenses from the company s directors and officers insurance policies an adverse outcome in these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see item legal proceedings 
securities and exchange commission investigation we are currently the subject of an sec investigation 
on november   the securities and exchange commission issued a formal order of private investigation relating to the matters involved in the restatements of our financial statements 
we are cooperating fully with the fort worth district office staff of the securities and exchange commission 
it is too soon to determine whether the outcome of this investigation will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
volatility of our stock price our stock price may experience volatility 
our stock price  like that of other companies  can be volatile 
some of the factors that could affect our stock price are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  and speculation in the press or investment community about our financial condition or results of operations 
general market conditions and domestic or international economic factors unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price 
for these reasons  investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices or financial results 
in addition  following periods of volatility in a company s securities  securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted and has been recently initiated against our company 
this type of litigation could result in liability  substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  amortization of goodwill over an estimated useful life is discontinued 
instead  goodwill will be reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events indicate impairment may have occurred 
the standard also requires acquired intangible assets to be recognized separately and amortized as appropriate 
sfas was effective for hanover on january  the adoption of sfas no 
has had an impact on future financial statements  due to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization expense 
for the year ended december   goodwill amortization expense was approximately million 
the transition provisions of sfas required us to identify our reporting units and perform an initial impairment assessment of the goodwill attributable to each reporting unit as of january  we performed our initial impairment assessment and determined that our reporting units are the same as our business segments and that no impairment existed as of january  however  due to a downturn in our business and changes in the business environment in which we operate  we completed an additional impairment analysis as of june  as a result of the test performed as of june   we recorded an estimated million impairment of goodwill attributable to our production and processing equipment fabrication business unit 
the second step of goodwill impairment test required us allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the production and processing equipment businesses assets 
we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of and determined that no adjustment to the impairment  recorded in the second quarter  was required 
the fair value of reporting units was estimated using a combination of the expected present value of future cash flows and the market approach  which uses actual market sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million goodwill impairment related to our pump division which we expect to sell in the table below presents the carrying amount of goodwill in thousands december  domestic rentals  international rentals  parts  service and used equipment  compressor and accessory fabrication  production and processing equipment fabrication  total  hanover s net income and earnings per share  adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization expense  for the twelve months ended december  and are as follows in thousands  except per share data restated restated net income   goodwill amortization  net of tax   adjusted net income   basic earnings per share  as reported 
goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share  as reported goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted diluted earnings per share in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets sfas 
sfas establishes the accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
this statement is effective for hanover on january  we are currently assessing the new standard and do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the new rules supersede sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
the new rules retain many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas  but significantly change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted the new standard  which had no material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
the statement updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
provisions of sfas related to the rescission of statement are effective for us on january  the provisions of sfas related to sfas are effective for transactions occurring after may  we have adopted the provisions of the new standard related to sfas  which had no material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
we will adopt the provision of sfas for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf will be effective for interim periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of eitf on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions and are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions and are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of sfas on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
fin will require us to include in our consolidated financial statements the special purpose entities that lease compression equipment to us beginning in july if these special purpose entities had been consolidated in hanover s financial statements as of december   hanover would add approximately  million in compressor equipment and approximately  million in debt to its balance sheet and reverse million of deferred gains that were recorded on its balance sheet as a result of the sale and leaseback transactions 
in addition  hanover would record depreciation expense on the compression equipment for prior periods net of tax as part of the cumulative effect of the adoption of fin and would record depreciation expense in future periods 
we are currently evaluating the impact of recording depreciation for prior periods 
after we adopt fin  we estimate that we will record approximately million per year in additional depreciation expense on our leased compression equipment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency risk 
hanover and its subsidiaries periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   the fair market value of these interest rate swaps  excluding the portion attributable to and included in accrued leasing  was a liability of approximately million  of which million was recorded in accrued liabilities and million in other long term liabilities 
we are party to five interest rate swaps to convert variable lease payments under certain lease arrangements to fixed payments as follows dollars in thousands fair value of the swap at maturity date company pays fixed rate notional amount december  at december   we are exposed to variable rental rates  which fluctuate with market interest rate  on a portion of the equipment leases we entered into in september and october assuming a hypothetical increase in the variable rates from those in effect at year end  the increase in annual leasing expense on these equipment leases would be approximately million 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency risk  however  we may consider the use of such instruments because of recent events in argentina and venezuela 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate revolving credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding bearing interest at a weighted average effective rate of per annum 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the weighted average interest rate from those in effect at december   the increase in annual interest expense for advances under this facility would be approximately million 
in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on funds transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts can either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement is reached  a preliminary payment may be made based on a dollar to peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also requires that the parties to such contracts renegotiate the price terms within days of the devaluation 
as a result of these negotiations  we received approximately million in partial reimbursements of which million are recorded in revenue  and expect to receive approximately million during we have renegotiated ten of eleven of our agreements in argentina and expect to renegotiate the remaining agreement in the near future 
we do not expect that the outcome of the renegotiation of the remaining agreement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
during the year ended december   we recorded an exchange loss of approximately million for assets exposed to currency translation in argentina 
for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross margin 
the economic situation in argentina is subject to change 
to the extent that the situation in argentina continues to deteriorate  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso against the dollar is reduced further  our results of operations in argentina could be materially and adversely affected which could result in reductions in our net income 
in addition  we have exposure to currency risks in venezuela 
to mitigate that risk  the majority of our existing contracts provide that we receive payment in us dollars rather than venezuelan bolivars  thus reducing our exposure to fluctuations in the bolivar s value 
during the year ended december   we recorded an exchange loss of approximately million for assets exposed to currency translation in venezuela 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross margin 
in december  certain opposition groups in venezuela initiated an unofficial national strike 
this has caused economic conditions in venezuela to deteriorate  including a substantial reduction in the production of oil in venezuela 
in addition  exchange controls have been put in place which put limitations on the amount of venezuelan currency which can be exchanged for foreign currency by businesses operating inside venezuela 
if the national strike continues  exchange controls remain in place  or economic conditions in venezuela continue to deteriorate  hanover s results of operations in venezuela could be materially and adversely affected  which could result in reductions in hanover s net income 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  our international rental revenues were decreased by approximately million as a result of the disruption in our operations in venezuela
