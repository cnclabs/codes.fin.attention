item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see future growth and operating results subject to risk at the end of this item for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we design  develop and market equipment used in building and expanding telecommunications networks 
our products have fallen into two categories  echo cancellation equipment and equipment that enables and facilitates communications over fiber optic networks 
to date  the majority of our revenue has been derived from sales of our echo cancellation products 
since entering the echo cancellation market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
we are currently selling our sixth generation echo cancellation product  which began production shipments in the second quarter of fiscal we began sales of our first optical communications product in september since that time our optical communications products have also evolved to meet the changing needs of our customers 
the current optical amplifier technology began shipment in fiscal on may   we announced our intention to exit the optical communications subsystem business and that we were actively seeking to sell this business 
since completing our initial public offering in june  we have completed three acquisitions see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
all of these acquisitions were done to bring needed technical skills into our research and development groups to aid in new product introductions 
the two more financially significant of these acquisitions are discussed below 
on february   we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of telinnovation in exchange for a total of  shares of common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the total value of the acquisition of approximately million was accounted for in three discrete components 
the first  approximately million related to purchased research and development  was written off in the fourth quarter of fiscal next  approximately million related to developed technology and goodwill was capitalized and was being amortized to expense over its estimated life of years 
the remaining million relates to restricted shares  the cost of which was recorded as deferred stock compensation and was charged to compensation expense in our research and development operations over the three year vesting period of the shares  assuming the holders of the restricted shares remained in our employ during the vesting period 
in april  we sold the echo cancellation software technology and related assets  previously acquired from telinnovation  to ti for a nominal gain see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  beginning in fiscal no further amortization of developed technology  goodwill or deferred stock compensation was recorded with respect to this acquisition 
on july   we completed our acquisition of atmosphere networks inc in exchange for a total of  shares of common stock and assumption of outstanding options with a collective aggregate value of approximately million  and approximately million of cash 
acquisition costs totaled approximately  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the total value of the acquisition of approximately million comprised approximately million in net assets  million associated with the value of the established workforce and million of goodwill 
the goodwill and established workforce costs were capitalized and were being amortized over their estimated lives of four years 
effective may   we adopted sfas  which resulted in the recharacterization of the then remaining established workforce costs into goodwill and replaced the amortization of goodwill with a regular evaluation of the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill for impairment 
upon adoption  we recorded a transitional impairment of the unamortized goodwill balance associated with this acquisition of approximately million  which has been reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
due to the adoption of sfas  we are no longer reporting amortization of goodwill from the atmosphere acquisition beginning with the first quarter of fiscal we generally recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of a definitive agreement exists  shipment to the customer has occurred  title and all risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  acceptance terms  if any have been fulfilled  no significant contractual obligations remain outstanding  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these conditions are not satisfactorily met  revenue from that transaction is deferred until all conditions are met 
we offer a five year warranty on all of our products 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product within five years from the invoice date 
we accrue for warranty costs at the time we recognize product revenue  based on our experience 
to date  the majority of our revenue has been derived from sales of our echo cancellation products 
we derived approximately  and of our total revenue from the sale of our echo cancellation products in fiscal  and  respectively 
on may   we announced our intention to exit the optical communications subsystem business and that we were actively seeking to sell this business 
as a result  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we will account for our optical business as a discontinued operation and all of our revenue will be generated from sales of our echo cancellation products 
our five largest echo cancellation customers accounted for approximately  and of our echo cancellation revenue during fiscal  and  respectively 
our domestic echo cancellation revenue accounted for  and of our echo cancellation revenue during fiscal  and  respectively 
historically the majority of our sales have been to customers in the us these customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal   and respectively 
however  sales to some of our customers in the us may result in our products eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of original equipment manufacturers that may distribute overseas 
to date  substantially all of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our five largest customers accounted for over  and of our total revenue in fiscal   and respectively 
our largest customer for the past two years has been verizon  a domestic echo cancellation customer  which has accounted for and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
prior to fiscal  qwest was our largest customer  accounting for of our total revenue in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes 
income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss fiscal years ended april  and revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for the increase has been the gradual recovery of our echo cancellation product sales since the second quarter of fiscal  which period marked our lowest level of sales since becoming a public company 
our echo cancellation product sales experienced an increase of million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this million increase in our echo revenue was largely driven by the addition of several new customers and increased sales volumes to existing customers in the wireless carrier space and to a lesser extent the expansion of our international customer base  primarily in the far east 
echo cancellation revenue in was largely driven by sales of our bbec and oc system based products  as well as the initial sales of our new bvp system 
the increase in echo revenue was partially offset by a million decline in optical revenues  which declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline in our optical sales was largely due to declines in our international optical revenue  which more than offset the growth in our domestic optical sales 
the decline in international optical sales was largely caused by our two largest international optical customers reducing their demand for product in the far east  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal geographically  revenue for fiscal continued to be generated largely from domestic sales  with of our fiscal revenue being generated by domestic customers 
this was a slight increase from fiscal domestic sales  which contributed to of total revenue in fiscal this increase was largely due to the growth in sales of our echo cancellation products to the domestic wireless telecommunications providers 
domestic echo cancellation revenue comprised and of our total echo cancellation revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
although we have seen an increase in sales of our echo cancellation equipment  overall sales are still being impacted by the slowdown in capital spending in the telecommunications industry  which we began experiencing in the latter half of fiscal  and we anticipate it will continue to have a substantial effect on our revenues for the foreseeable future 
due to our announced intent to sell our optical business targeted for the first quarter of fiscal  we expect that sales of our echo cancellation products will be the primary source of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
cost of goods sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was in part being driven by increased unit sales of our echo cancellation products but was also impacted by discontinuation of our titanium optical systems product  which resulted in the write off of million of inventory 
also contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold was the increase in sales of domestic oem optical products  which carry a higher average cost per unit 
these increases in costs were partially offset by a reduction in echo cancellation inventory excess and obsolete write downs  which were recorded as a special provision of million in fiscal this fiscal special provision related to estimated excess levels of oc inventory  as our primary customer for that product in fiscal discontinued all plans to purchase that product for the foreseeable future 
due to the addition of a number of new customers in fiscal  we were able to realize sufficient sales of our oc product such that we sold our entire unreserved inventory of the product and began to sell inventory  which we had previously identified as excess in fiscal due to stronger than anticipated demand for this echo cancellation product in the latter part of fiscal  we benefited from the sale of previously written down echo cancellers with an original cost of  but no carrying value 
due to the proposed sale of our optical subsystems business  all future costs of sales associated with our optical business will be reported as part of discontinued operations  resulting in only echo cancellation cost of sales being reported beginning in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin was driven largely by increased sales mix of our echo cancellation products  which have historically carried a higher profit margin than our optical products 
gross margin for our echo cancellation products was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the primary cause for the increase in our stand alone echo cancellation gross margin was the impact of the oc write down in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a million special provision for potentially excess oc inventory when our largest customer for the product at that time canceled all planned purchases 
due to the addition of several new oc customers in fiscal  we have been able to sell through the unreserved levels of inventory of this product and have begun selling previously written down product  which has resulted in a benefit of over  the impact of the oc reserve in fiscal and the benefit in accounts for approximately of the percentage points increase in echo cancellation margins during fiscal there were no special echo inventory provisions in fiscal gross margins for optical communications products were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal of the decline of percentage points in our year over year optical gross margins  of the percentage points were due to the recognition of a million special provision for excess and obsolete titanium inventory in the second quarter of fiscal upon discontinuation of that product 
there were no similar provisions in fiscal  leading to the year over year decline in optical gross margins 
the balance was primarily due to the mix of optical products during fiscal being more heavily weighted to our domestic oem products  which carry a much lower gross margin than our international products 
due to our announced intent to sell our optical business in the first quarter of  we expect our overall margins in fiscal to more closely track with that of our echo cancellation margins 
overview of operating expenses 
our operating expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was primarily due to the restructuring of our optical business as a result of the discontinuation of our titanium product and associated restructuring in september  reductions in amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles and amortization of deferred stock compensation 
as a result of the restructuring  approximately of our workforce was terminated in september  resulting in a marked decrease in operating expenses  primarily research and development beginning in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  spending on titanium research and development materials and consultants  and marketing efforts for this new product were stopped in the latter part of the second quarter of fiscal  which also contributed to the decline in operating expenses during the fiscal the reduction in amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets was due to the sale of our echo cancellation software technology to ti at the end of fiscal and the adoption of sfas in fiscal the reduction in amortization of deferred stock compensation was also due in large part to the sale of our echo cancellation software technology to ti  as well as termination of former atmosphere employees as part of the restructuring that occurred when we discontinued development of our titanium optical systems product in september due to the sale of our optical business  which is targeted to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal  we would expect a further reduction in overall operating expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
sales and marketing expenses of million in fiscal declined by approximately million from fiscal approximately million of the decline was driven by declines in salary and related spending  including travel and conferences  as a result of the reductions in workforce that occurred in january and september and tighter control of discretionary spending 
other factors leading to the decline are decreases in depreciation expense due to the write off of titanium related sales and marketing fixed assets and the reduction in marketing and promotional spending  including trade shows due to the cancellation of our titanium product in the first half of fiscal we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to decline in fiscal due to our announced intent to sell our optical business  which is targeted to close in the first quarter of fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  and costs associated with contract consultants  equipment and supplies used in the development of echo cancellation and optical communications products  as well as amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with the telinnovation acquisition  which ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal upon the sale of our echo software technology to ti  and amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with the atmosphere acquisition 
research and development expense of million in fiscal declined by approximately million from fiscal the decline was due to two main factors 
the first factor was the elimination of spending related to our titanium optical system development beginning in the latter part of the second quarter of fiscal  which contributed to an aggregate reduction in employee related costs  consulting costs and materials and supplies costs of million 
the second key factor was a reduction of over million in the level of amortization of stock compensation charged to research and development 
this reduction was due primarily to the sale of our echo cancellation software business in april and  to a lesser extent  to the termination of former atmosphere employees as part of the discontinuation of our titanium product development 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in depreciation of approximately  due to increased levels of lab equipment to support echo and optical product development 
we expect to experience a further decline in our research and development spending due to the planned sale of the remainder of our optical business in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
general and administrative expense in fiscal totaled million  approximately a  decline from fiscal the decline in general and administrative spending is primarily due to reductions in professional services spending in fiscal and to a lesser degree reductions in the level of foreign exchange transaction costs associated with the establishment and expansion of our international subsidiaries in fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses to decline modestly in fiscal  as the sale of our optical business will have a more limited impact on these costs as compared to sales and marketing and research and development 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
amortization expense was eliminated in its entirety in fiscal  resulting in a decline of million from fiscal the elimination was due to two factors 
first  the sale of our echo cancellation software technology in april resulted in the elimination of amortization related to the goodwill and intangibles from our acquisition of telinnovation  which accounted for million of the amortization in fiscal the balance was due to the elimination of amortization related to goodwill and the employee intangible associated with our acquisition of atmosphere  upon adoption of sfas  which accounted for million of the amortization in fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of changes to the accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets prescribed by sfas restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal related to our decision to discontinue our efforts to develop and market our titanium optical system 
our decision to discontinue the product was announced in the latter part of the quarter  after we determined that the near term market opportunity for this type of product was continuing to deteriorate 
therefore  despite our strong belief in titanium s long term promise  we determined that the financial drain from titanium development and marketing ceased to be justified  and we decided to discontinue our efforts to bring this product to market 
as a result  we implemented a restructuring program at the end of september  which included the elimination of approximately of our worldwide workforce  and the recognition of impairment losses and the cancellation of certain purchase commitments for materials to be used in our development of titanium  which resulted in a total charge of million 
as of the end of fiscal  all but approximately  of the cash restructuring charges had been paid 
the balance is related primarily to outplacement services  which is expected to be paid out in the first half of fiscal during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  consistent with our expectations  we realized over million per quarter of pretax savings associated with this restructuring  primarily in the area of research and development 
we believe this level of savings should continue for the foreseeable future unless telecommunications provider spending dramatically increases or we elect to expand our research efforts into other currently unforeseen areas 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
we expect that a restructuring charge will be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal in conjunction with our planned sale of our optical business 
this charge will be reported as part of discontinued operations 
the precise amount of charge is currently not known as it is dependent on the terms of the final sale of the business  but it may be significant 
other income  net 
other income  net in fiscal consists of interest income of million on our invested cash and cash equivalent balances  offset by a nominal amount of interest and other expense 
overall  interest income declined by million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates reducing our earnings on invested balances  and to a lesser extent  a decline in the average invested cash balance 
the other key factor in the decline in other income  net was the lack of a gain on disposal of assets  as experienced in fiscal when we sold our echo cancellation software technology and related assets to ti for a gain of over  income taxes 
income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was a provision of  as compared to in fiscal the income taxes incurred in fiscal are due to providing taxes on our international operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we discontinued recording federal and state tax benefits associated with our domestic operating losses due to uncertainty about the recoverability of our net operating loss carry forward position 
we will continue to record no benefit for these domestic operating loss carry forwards until such time as we have generated a consistent pattern of profitability 
we expect to continue to report a minimal tax provision for the foreseeable future related to our international operations 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
the million cumulative effect of an accounting change reported in fiscal represents the transitional impairment loss for previously recorded goodwill associated with our acquisition of atmosphere  which we recorded in connection with our adoption of sfas effective may  fiscal years ended april  and revenue 
revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for this decrease was the decline in sales of our echo cancellation products as we continued to experience the slowdown in infrastructure spending by our telecommunications customers  which began in the second half of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal despite this slowdown in spending  our echo cancellation products remained the primary source of revenue in fiscal  representing of fiscal revenue 
our series of fourth generation echo cancellation products remained the main contributors to the echo cancellation revenue stream in fiscal our fifth generation  oc echo cancellation system  which began production shipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  saw limited activity in fiscal as the primary customer  qwest  substantially decreased its spending to expand and or upgrade its network 
revenue from echo cancellation products was million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal revenue from licenses of our echo cancellation software  prior to the sale of that technology to ti  represented less than of total revenue in both fiscal and although our optical products were also impacted by the slowdown in infrastructure spending  they experienced a much more modest decline from fiscal as one of our new oem relationships has begun to generate meaningful sales levels 
revenue from optical products was million in down from million in fiscal geographically  our fiscal revenue remained primarily domestic  at of total worldwide revenue a slight decreased from in fiscal this decrease was due in large part to the domestic telecommunications market being softer than the rest of the world in fiscal the slowdown in capital spending in the telecommunications industry we first experienced in the latter half of fiscal continued throughout cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to the decline in product sales in fiscal this decline in product costs was partially offset by a shift in the sales mix towards higher cost optical products and to a lesser extent increases in operations department costs  primarily salary and related facilities costs 
also partially offsetting this decline in overall cost of sales was a million provision for excess inventory related to our oc echo cancellation system  due to our largest customer for that product making a sudden and significant reduction in its projected demand 
gross profit 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the primary factors causing this decrease are changes in the sales mix from our historically high margin echo cancellation products toward lower margin optical products  increased provisions for inventory as discussed above and the relatively fixed manufacturing organization s costs being spread over a smaller revenue base 
gross margins on our echo cancellation products were down to in fiscal from in fiscal  due in large part to the provision taken for excess inventory of the oc product and to a lesser extent due to continued pressures on selling prices and the relatively fixed nature of our manufacturing costs 
gross margins on our optical products dropped to in fiscal from in fiscal  due in larger part to our optical sales being more heavily concentrated in lower margin oem products in fiscal and the relatively fixed nature of our manufacturing costs 
overview of operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily driven by across the board increases in personnel and related costs as we expanded all facets of our operations to prepare for the introduction and sale of our new titanium optical system and materials and consulting expenses related to development of our titanium optical system 
however  at the end of the first half of fiscal  we implemented a hiring freeze and subsequently completed a reduction in force to ensure we had the proper employees in the proper positions 
the reduction in workforce resulted in a charge of approximately  which was included in cost of goods sold and operating expenses based on the capacities in which the terminated employees worked 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary causes for the increase were increases in personnel and related costs and promotion and trade show costs as we introduced and began to position ourselves for production shipment of our new titanium product 
partially offsetting these increases were reduced commission costs due to the lower sales levels in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to increased personnel and related costs and increased materials and consulting costs primarily associated with our optical communications products  principally our titanium optical system 
personnel and related costs were up million due mostly to hiring  including the former ilotron engineers who were hired independent from our acquisition of ilotron s technology 
we increased spending on materials  product development and test  and consulting services by million in fiscal primarily related to our titanium optical product 
amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with our acquisitions of telinnovation and atmosphere was million and million in fiscal  respectively  and million and million in fiscal  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to decreased personnel and related costs  as the level of executive compensation declined year over year and the level of recruiting was cut in the second half of the fiscal year after our hiring freeze was implemented 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
in fiscal  we recorded expense of million  an increase of million from fiscal  for amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  including goodwill  purchased technology and established workforce 
these assets were acquired as part of the acquisitions of telinnovation  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and of atmosphere networks  in the first quarter of fiscal other income  net 
other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to the decreased interest income on funds invested due to lower average interest rates earned on invested balances and to a lesser extent lower average invested cash balances during fiscal the decline in interest earned was partially offset by a million gain realized on the sale of our echo cancellation software technology and related assets see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the principal reasons for the existence of a tax provision in fiscal despite the operating loss for the year are certain non deductible costs associated with our acquisitions  the amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets  and the establishment of a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  due to our continued operating losses and the fact that recovery of these assets is now dependent on future operating profits 
the factors that contributed to a higher effective tax rate in fiscal were primarily related to the amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets combined with the relatively small pretax profit for fiscal these adverse impacts on the tax rate were partially offset by the effect of having earned greater tax exempt interest income in fiscal stock based compensation we recorded deferred compensation of million as of april   as a result of stock options granted in fiscal we amortized the deferred compensation over the corresponding vesting period of the stock options 
we amortized approximately   and  of the deferred compensation to general and administrative expense in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of the third quarter of fiscal  this component of deferred stock compensation had been fully amortized 
associated with the acquisition of telinnovation in february  we recorded million of deferred compensation related to  restricted shares granted to the telinnovation employees 
these restricted shares were tied to the employees continuing employment with ditech 
the deferred compensation was being amortized as research and development expense over the three year vesting period of the restricted shares 
as part of the disposition of our echo software technology to ti  ti became the custodian of these restricted shares and will release them to the telinnovation employees  who now work for ti  as they are earned 
should a former telinnovation employee leave their employment prior to earning their restricted shares  the shares would be forfeited to ti 
since all former telinnovation employees have left our employment and are now working for ti  the net deferred stock compensation of million remaining on april  was eliminated as part of the sale transaction 
therefore  there was no amortization related to deferred stock compensation associated with our acquisition of telinnovation in fiscal  nor will there be any in the future 
we amortized approximately million and million of telinnovation related deferred compensation in fiscal and  respectively 
associated with the acquisition of atmosphere on july   we recorded million of deferred compensation related to unvested options assumed in the acquisition 
this amount has been reduced from time to time due to option cancellations associated with employee terminations 
this deferred compensation was amortized to research and development expense over the remaining vesting terms of the assumed options  which became fully vested in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the acquisition of atmosphere  we issued nonqualified stock options for approximately  shares of our common stock at a price equal to a discount from the market value of the stock on its grant date of august  the discount was recorded as deferred compensation of million in august subsequent to recording this deferred compensation in august  the gross amount of deferred compensation has been reduced from time to time for the impact of option cancellations due to employee terminations 
the net deferred compensation is being amortized to research and development expense over the remaining term of the original forty eight month vesting period of the options 
the atmosphere related deferred compensation expense totaled approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
due to the cancellation of all remaining options  from this august grant  as part of our option exchange program as described below  the remaining deferred compensation of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal and no further amortization of this deferred compensation will occur in the future 
in february  we commenced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees  including officers 
we implemented this program in order to align employee and stockholder interests while sustaining high levels of performance during the current stagnant economic period 
a large number of our employees stock option exercise prices were significantly higher than the current market price of ditech common stock and  in an effort to motivate and retain our employees  our board approved this stock option exchange program 
under this program  eligible employees were offered the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding stock options with exercise prices of or more for new replacement options pursuant to the terms of the program 
the original options exchanged were canceled on march   and replacement options  covering of the number of shares under the original options exchanged  will be granted on september  at the then fair market value of our common stock on such grant date see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas replaces emerging issues task force eitf issue no  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that liabilities associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value only when the liability is incurred  as defined by fasb concepts statement no 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a roll forward of the entity s product warranty liabilities 
we will apply the recognition provisions of fin prospectively to guarantees issued after december  the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements for fiscal year as is customary in the industry and as required by law in the us and certain other jurisdictions  certain of our contracts provide remedies to our customers  such as defense  settlement  or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products 
from time to time  we indemnify customers against combinations of losses  expenses  or liabilities arising from various trigger events related to the sale and the use of our products and services 
in addition  from time to time we also provide protection to customers against claims related to undiscovered liabilities  additional product liability or environmental obligations 
in our experience  claims made under such indemnifications are rare 
in connection with the sale of our echo cancellation software technology to ti in april  we indemnified ti for various matters 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnifications is not material 
as permitted or required under delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law  we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner that a person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation  and  with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for our fiscal year the accompanying financial statements comply with the disclosure requirements of this new standard 
we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect fin to have a material effect on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our results of consolidated operations  financial condition or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources since march  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal in fiscal  we used million of cash in operations  primarily due to the net loss of million for the year less million of non cash items including depreciation  amortization of stock compensation  portions of the restructuring charge and the cumulative effect of the accounting change related to the transitional impairment of goodwill 
the other key offset to the net loss in fiscal was the recovery of the income tax receivable of million 
partially offsetting this favorable cash movement were increases in accounts receivable and inventory which totaled million and reductions in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue totaling million 
in fiscal  we used million of cash in operations  primarily due to the net loss for the year of million  less million of non cash items including depreciation  amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles  amortization of stock compensation and the establishment of the million deferred income tax valuation allowance 
the other key cause for the use of cash was the increase of million in income taxes receivable  which was due to our expected recovery of million of prior taxes paid  through the carryback of losses generated in fiscal these uses of cash were partially offset by reductions in accounts receivable and inventory and increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
in fiscal  we generated million in cash from operations  primarily due to operating profits  after including the impact of non cash items  and to a lesser extent due to a reduction in accounts receivable 
these net sources of cash were partially offset by million net use of cash associated with increases in inventory and other current assets and reductions in accounts payable and deferred revenue balances 
in fiscal  we generated  of cash from investing activities 
the cash generated was primarily related to the collection of the million second installment from the sale of our echo cancellation software technology to ti  which was substantially offset by the addition of equipment to support our titanium product development prior to its discontinuation in september of in fiscal  investing activities generated million of cash due to million of net cash received from the sale of our echo cancellation software technology and related assets 
the cash received from the sale was partially offset by increased purchases of property and equipment to support the growth in staff and the development and introduction of titanium 
in fiscal  investing activities used million  mostly for the purchase of property and equipment  offset somewhat by a net source of cash of  resulting from our purchase the net assets of atmosphere networks in july in fiscal  we generated  from financing activities  primarily due to the proceeds from shares issued under employee stock plans 
in fiscal  we generated million in financing activities  primarily due to the proceeds from shares issued under employee stock plans 
in fiscal we used million in financing activities  primarily due to the retirement in the second quarter of fiscal of approximately million in notes payable and capital lease obligations assumed in the atmosphere acquisition  partially offset by approximately million from issuance of stock under employee stock plans 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility leases see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements and normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet in the two buildings that form our mountain view headquarters 
this facility lease expires in june we also lease a research and development facility in australia and one in the united kingdom  each of which contains approximately  square feet with lease terms that expire in april and october  respectively 
as part of our plans to exit our optical business  we intend to negotiate a buyout or sublease of our australian and united kingdom leases  as we intend for our australian and uk operations to be permanently closed 
we may also pursue a sublease of a portion of our mountain view headquarters  if we ultimately deem there to be excess space in mountain view 
we believe that the space under the combined leases is adequate to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes our financial commitments in thousands 
see also note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years operating leases    purchase commitments   total    as a result of the substantially lower gross margins in our optical subsystems business and the lack of growth in our optical business in recent periods  we announced in may our intent to sell this business 
we expect that the sale of our optical business will not have a material impact on cash  as the proceeds received from the sale will likely be consumed to cover severance benefits and lease buyouts of our international optical operations 
if and when the sale of our optical business is completed  we expect that cash flows from operations will be much closer to break even  if not positive  and the level of investment in plant and equipment will decline  as our echo business has historically been less capital intensive 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from our existing cash and collection of the remaining million retention portion of the sales proceeds from the sale of our echo software technology to ti in fiscal we also have available our million operating line of credit with a bank 
this line expires in august  but is subject to a renewal option  which we have not yet decided to exercise 
see also note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our ability to fund our operations beyond the next twelve months will be dependent on the overall demand of the telecommunications providers for new capital equipment and our ability to continue to improve sales and thereby reduce our consumption of cash to support operations 
should our customers capital spending patterns deteriorate  we could need to find additional sources of cash during fiscal or look to further reductions in spending to protect our cash reserves 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our allowance for bad debts  provisions for inventories  warranties  valuation and impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets and recovery of deferred income taxes receivable 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
to the extent there are material differences between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of a definitive agreement exists  shipment to the customer has occurred  title and all risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  acceptance terms  if any  have been fulfilled  no significant contractual obligations remain outstanding  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these conditions are not satisfactorily met  revenue from that transaction is deferred until all conditions are satisfactorily met 
we offer a five year warranty on all of our products 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product within five years from the invoice date 
we accrue for warranty costs at the time we recognize product revenue  based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures  which would result in a decrease in gross profits 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for bad debts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate suddenly  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
provision for inventory valuation 
we provide valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on our ongoing assessment of inventory levels as compared to our estimates of future market demand and market conditions 
to the extent that a severe  unexpected decline in forecasted demand occurs due to either changing customer circumstances or our strategic decision to exit a particular product line  significant charges for excess inventory could occur  such as the million charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal and the million charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal valuation and impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
the purchase combinations carried out by us in prior years required management to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  with the atmosphere acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we eliminated 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimates would be required 
if a change in estimate were to occur beyond one year from the date of the acquisition  the change would be recorded in our statement of operations rather than as an adjustment to goodwill 
as required by sfas  which we adopted effective may   we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or annually  whichever occurs first 
upon adoption  we determined that we had sustained a transitional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets generated from our purchase of atmosphere 
as a result  we recognized a transitional impairment loss  which was reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal equal to the entire remaining balance of acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets 
unless we engage in other acquisitions  this will not be a material accounting policy in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences along with net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is no longer more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that a valuation allowance against our then existing deferred tax asset position was necessary 
we based this decision on the fact that in the fourth quarter of  we generated sufficient operating losses on a tax basis to fully recover all taxes paid in prior years 
in addition  the sale of our echo cancellation software technology and software generated such large loss carry forwards for tax purposes  that we could not conclude that the recovery of our deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
should we be able to demonstrate a track record of sustained profitability in the future  some or all of the valuation allowance established since april could be reversed  which would have a favorable impact on our tax rates in the quarter of adjustment 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and the liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
future growth and operating results subject to risk our business and the value of our stock are subject to a number of risks  which are set out below 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  which would likely have a corresponding impact on the value of our common stock 
these risk factors should be carefully reviewed 
we depend on a limited number of customers for our products  the loss of any one of which could cause our revenue to decrease 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
a customer may stop buying our products or significantly reduce its orders for our products for a number of reasons  including the acquisition of a customer by another company or a delay in a scheduled product introduction 
if this happens  our revenue could be greatly reduced  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
for example  qwest  our largest customer in fiscal  accounted for less than of our revenue in fiscal and only of our sales in all of fiscal  time periods in which revenues were substantially less than in recent prior periods  as compared to of our revenue in all of fiscal verizon  our largest customer in fiscal and fiscal  which is also our largest echo cancellation customer  accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
due to continuing difficult economic conditions  many operators in the telecommunications industry have experienced financial difficulties  which have dramatically reduced their capital expenditures and  in some cases  resulted in their filing for bankruptcy or becoming acquired by other operators 
we expect this trend to continue  which may result in our dependence on an even smaller customer base 
we are reliant solely on our echo business to generate revenue growth and profitability  which could limit our rate of future revenue growth 
to date  the majority of our revenue has been derived from sales of our echo cancellation products 
in addition  the echo cancellation portion of our business has generated substantially higher gross margins than the optical subsystem portion of our business 
although we have expended significant efforts on expanding optical revenues and diversifying our optical customer base  we did not obtain the results we hoped to achieve  and so we announced in the first quarter of fiscal that we intend to sell our optical business and to focus on our echo cancellation business 
we expect that  at least for the near term  we will be entirely dependent on our echo cancellation products to generate revenues and to drive us closer to break even operating results 
however  reliance on our echo cancellation business to be the main driver of near term growth will likely be a limiting factor on revenue growth rates due to the relatively small size of the overall echo cancellation market 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we anticipate that they may continue to do so in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of several factors  some of which are outside of our control 
if revenue declines in a quarter  as we experienced in the second half of fiscal and again in the second quarter of fiscal  our operating results will be adversely affected because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with variations in revenue in a quarter 
adverse changes in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
our revenue may vary from period to period 
factors that could cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period include changes in capital spending in the telecommunications industry and larger macroeconomic trends  the timing or cancellation of orders from  or shipments to  existing and new customers  delays outside of our control in obtaining necessary components from our suppliers  delays outside of our control in the installation of products for our customers  the timing of new product and service introductions by us  our customers  our partners or our competitors  competitive pressures  variations in the mix of products offered by us  and variations in our sales or distribution channels 
in particular  sales of our echo cancellation products  which historically have accounted for the majority of our revenue and will account for all of our revenue due to the anticipated sale of our optical business in the first quarter of fiscal  have typically come from our major customers ordering large quantities when they deploy a switching center 
consequently  we may get one or more large orders in one quarter from a customer and then no orders in the next quarter 
as a result  our revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  especially now that we are entirely reliant on our echo cancellation business 
our customers may delay or rescind orders for our existing products in anticipation of the release of our or our competitors new products 
further  if our or our competitors new products substantially replace the functionality of our existing products  our existing products may become obsolete  and we could be forced to sell them at reduced prices or even at a loss 
revenue can vary period to period if planned dates of new product introductions are missed and the product release occurs in a later quarter 
as an example of this risk  we had initially planned to begin production shipment of the international version of our oc echo canceller  the stm  in the second quarter of calendar however due to product reprioritization  schedule delays and prolonged customer testing of this new product  we did not ship any units for revenue until fiscal in addition  the sales cycle for our products are typically lengthy 
before ordering our products  our customers perform significant technical evaluations  which typically last up to days in the case of our echo cancellation 
once an order is placed  delivery times can vary depending on the product ordered 
as a result  revenue forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter may not occur in that quarter 
because of the potential large size of our customers orders  this would adversely affect our revenue for the quarter 
our expenses may vary from period to period 
many of our expenses do not vary with our revenue 
factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include the extent of marketing and sales efforts necessary to promote and sell our products  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  the availability and cost of key components for our products  and the timing of personnel hiring 
if we incur such additional expenses in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue  our profitability would be adversely affected and we may even incur losses for that quarter  as we have continued to experience since the third quarter of fiscal if we do not successfully develop and introduce our new products  our products may become obsolete 
we operate in an industry that experiences rapid technological change  and if we do not successfully develop and introduce our new products and our existing products become obsolete due to product introductions by competitors  our revenues will decline 
we may not be able to successfully produce or market our new products in commercial quantities  complete product development when anticipated  or increase sales 
these risks are of particular concern when a new generation product is introduced 
as a result  while we believe we will achieve our product introduction dates  they may be delayed 
for example  we originally expected our international version of our fifth generation echo cancellation system  the stm  to be available in the second quarter of calendar however  we did not realize our first revenue shipment of this product until fiscal additionally  in fiscal  sales of our fourth generation echo cancellers and our broadband system generated the majority of our echo revenue while sales of our fifth generation  oc echo cancellation system fell short of our expectations due to a sudden decline in projected demand in the third quarter of fiscal from our primary targeted customer for this product  qwest  which led to the establishment of million of excess inventory reserves in the third quarter of fiscal we have begun to see acceptance of the oc system by some of our newer customers over the past few quarters 
the increased sales of this product have allowed us to draw down the entire unreserved oc inventory and we have begun selling previously written down units of this product 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to sell additional written down units in the future 
we have in the past experienced  and in the future may experience  unforeseen delays in the development of our new products 
we must devote a substantial amount of resources in order to develop and achieve commercial acceptance of our new products 
we may not be able to address evolving demands in these markets in a timely or effective way 
even if we do  customers in these markets may purchase or otherwise implement competing products 
we anticipate that average selling prices for our products will decline in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to become profitable 
we expect that the price we can charge our customers for our products will decline as new technologies become available  as we expand the distribution of products through oems  value added resellers and distributors internationally and as competitors lower prices either as a result of reduced manufacturing costs or a strategy of cutting margins to achieve or maintain market share 
as a result  we may face larger losses in the near term and our ability to become profitable in future periods 
we expect price reductions to be more pronounced  at least in the near term  due to more established competition for our echo cancellation products and the addition of new distributor relationships 
while we intend to reduce our manufacturing costs in an attempt to maintain our margins and to introduce enhanced products with higher selling prices  we may not execute these programs on schedule 
in addition  our competitors may drive down prices faster or lower than our planned cost reduction programs 
even if we can reduce our manufacturing costs  many of our operating costs will not decline immediately if revenue decreases due to price competition 
we face intense competition  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  continually evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  including our customers 
certain of our customers also have the ability to internally produce the equipment that they currently purchase from us 
in such cases  we also compete with their internal product development capabilities 
we expect that competition will increase in the future 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  manufacturing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully 
in our echo cancellation business  we face competition from two major direct manufacturers of stand alone echo cancellers  tellabs and nms 
the other competition in the echo cancellation market comes from voice switch manufacturers 
these manufacturers don t sell echo cancellation products or compete in the open echo cancellation market  but they integrate echo cancellation functionality within their switches  either as hardware modules or as software running on chips 
a more widespread adoption of internal echo cancellation solutions would present an increased competitive threat to us if the net result was the elimination of demand for our echo cancellation system products 
with the downturn in spending in the telecommunications industry  service providers appear to be exploring these alternative sources of echo cancellation more thoroughly  while they wait for more robust capital spending budgets to return 
if our customers decide to design these alternative sources of echo cancellation into their future network expansion  it could adversely impact the speed and duration of our echo sales recovery 
most of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we will 
we now license our echo cancellation software from ti  and if we do not receive the level of support we expect from ti  it could adversely affect our echo cancellation systems business 
in april  we sold our echo cancellation software technology and future revenue streams from our licenses of technology acquired from telinnovation to ti  in return for cash and a long term license of the echo cancellation software 
although the licensing agreement has strong guarantees of support for the software used in our products  if ti were to breach that agreement in some fashion  and not deliver complete and timely support to us  our success in the echo cancellation systems business could be adversely affected 
if ti licenses its echo cancellation software to other echo cancellation systems companies  this could increase the competitive pressures on our echo cancellation systems business 
under the terms of the sale agreement of our echo cancellation software to ti  ti is precluded from licensing the software to other echo cancellation systems companies for a period of two years and to two specified competitors for a period of four years 
if ti were to license its echo cancellation software to other echo cancellation systems companies after two years  this could increase the level of competition and adversely affect our success in our echo cancellation systems business 
if we do not reduce manufacturing costs of our products to respond to anticipated decreasing average selling prices  our ability to generate profits could be adversely affected 
in order to respond to increasing competition and our anticipation that average selling prices will decrease  we are attempting to reduce manufacturing costs of our new and existing products 
if we do not reduce manufacturing costs and average selling prices decrease  our operating results will be adversely affected 
manufacturing is currently outsourced to a small number of contract manufacturers 
we believe that our current contract manufacturing relationships provide us with competitive manufacturing costs for our products 
however  if we or these contract manufacturers terminate any of these relationships  or if we otherwise establish new relationships  we may encounter problems in the transition of manufacturing to another contract manufacturer  which could temporarily increase our manufacturing costs and cause production delays 
we operate in an industry experiencing rapid technological change  which may make our products obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop  introduce and market enhancements to our existing products and to introduce new products in a timely manner to meet our customers requirements 
the markets we target are characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent enhancements to existing products and new product introductions  changes in end user requirements  and evolving industry standards 
we may not be able to respond quickly and effectively to these rapid changes 
the emerging nature of these products and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products  particularly in response to competitive product offerings 
we may not be able to respond quickly and effectively to these developments 
the introduction or market acceptance of products incorporating superior technologies or the emergence of alternative technologies and new industry standards could render our existing products  as well as our products currently under development  obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  we may have only a limited amount of time to penetrate certain markets  and we may not be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of our products before competitors offer products and services similar or superior to our products 
we may fail to anticipate or respond on a cost effective and timely basis to technological developments  changes in industry standards or end user requirements 
we may also experience significant delays in product development or introduction 
in addition  we may fail to release new products or to upgrade or enhance existing products on a timely basis 
we may need to modify our products as a result of changes in industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards  whether through adoption by official standards committees or widespread use by service providers  could require us to redesign our products 
if such standards become widespread  and our products are not in compliance  our current and potential customers may not purchase our products 
the rapid development of new standards increases the risk that our competitors could develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards before us 
if incumbent and emerging competitive service providers and the telecommunications industry as a whole experience a further downturn or reduction in growth rate  the demand for our products will decrease  which will adversely affect our business 
we have experienced  and continue to experience  as have other companies in our sector  a slowdown in infrastructure spending by our customers 
this trend of lower capital spending in the telecommunications industry contributed to the decline in our revenues  beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing to the present 
if this trend continues  it will continue to have a negative effect on our operating results 
our success will depend in large part on development  expansion and or upgrade of voice and data communications networks 
we are subject to risks of growth constraints due to our current and planned dependence on domestic and international telecommunications service providers 
these potential customers may be constrained for a number of reasons  including their limited capital resources  economic conditions  changes in regulation and consolidation 
some of the key components used in our products are currently available only from sole sources  the loss of which could delay product shipments 
we rely on certain vendors as the sole source of certain key components that we use in our products 
for example  we rely on ti as the sole source vendor for the digital signal processors used in our echo cancellation and voice enhancement products 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our vendors 
any extended interruption in the supply of these components would affect our ability to meet scheduled deliveries of our products to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of these components  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships  and we could lose customers and orders 
some suppliers of key components may reduce their inventory levels which could result in longer lead times for future component purchases and any delays in filling our demand may reduce or delay our expected product shipments and revenues 
although we believe there are currently ample supplies of components for our products  it is possible that in the near term component manufacturers may reduce their inventory levels and require firm orders before they manufacture components 
this reduction in stocking levels could lead to extended lead times in the future 
if we are unable to procure our planned quantities of materials from all prospective suppliers  and if we cannot use alternative components  we could experience revenue delays or reductions and potential harm to customer relationships 
an example of this risk occurred in the third quarter of fiscal as two vendors supplying us with components used in our oc product did not meet our total demand 
as a result  the schedule shipment of our oc product was delayed  which contributed to our revenue shortfall in that quarter 
we may experience unforeseen problems as we diversify our international customer base  which would impair our ability to grow our business 
historically  we have sold mostly to customers in north america 
we are continuing to execute on our plans to expand our international presence through the establishment of new relationships with established international oems  value added resellers and distributors 
however  we may still be required to hire additional personnel for the overseas market and incur other unforeseen expenditures 
our planned expansion overseas may not be successful 
as we expand our sales focus further into international markets  we will face new and complex issues that we may not have faced before  such as expanded risk to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  manufacturing overseas  political or economic instability  potential adverse tax consequences and broadened import export controls  which will put additional strain on our management personnel 
in the past  substantially all of our international sales have been denominated in us dollars  however  in the future  we may be forced to denominate a greater amount of international sales in foreign currencies 
additionally  the number of installations we will be responsible for is likely to increase as a result of our continued international expansion 
in the past  we have experienced difficulties installing one of our echo cancellation products overseas 
in addition  we may not be able to establish more relationships with international oems  value added resellers and distributors 
if we do not  our ability to increase sales could be materially impaired 
if we lose the services of any of our key management or key technical personnel  or are unable to retain or attract additional technical personnel  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be impaired 
we depend heavily on timothy k 
montgomery  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and on other key management and technical personnel  for the conduct and development of our business and the development of our products 
recently  we have attempted to mitigate some of this risk through some key hires 
however  there is no guarantee that if we lost the services of one or more of these people for any reason  that it would not adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our business and to develop new products 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
however  we may not be able to do so 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which we may not be able to protect 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  such measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
we may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation 
although we do not believe that our products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties may still assert infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
such assertions could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we review acquisition and investment prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  augment our market coverage  secure supplies of critical materials or enhance our technological capabilities 
acquisitions or investments could result in a number of financial consequences  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large one time write offs  reduced cash balances and related interest income  higher fixed expenses which require a higher level of revenues to maintain gross margins  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to other acquisition related intangible assets and impairment of goodwill 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous operational risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  diversion of resources from our existing businesses  products or technologies  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we may not realize expected benefits from our restructuring efforts 
as a result of the continuing unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by telecommunications service providers  we implemented a restructuring program at the end of september  which included a workforce reduction and the discontinuation of development and marketing of our titanium product 
while we realized significant savings in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of this restructuring  there can be no assurances that we will continue to realize the same level of benefits in the foreseeable future 
further  due to our recently announced decision to dispose of our optical business we will undertake another restructuring in the first quarter of fiscal the extent of this new restructuring will be dependent on the nature of the sale agreement we are able to negotiate 
there is no guarantee that we will realize sufficient benefits from this impending restructuring to accomplish our goal of achieving break even earnings in fiscal from our echo cancellation operations or that further restructurings will not be required 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments and our investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments 
as a result of the short term duration of the financial instruments in our investment portfolio  we do not believe that our financial instruments are materially sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our cash and cash equivalents as of april  of million all have maturities of days or less and bear an average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts of the underlying securities based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
to date  substantially all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
as only a small amount of foreign bills are paid in currencies other than the us dollar  our foreign exchange risk is considered immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
