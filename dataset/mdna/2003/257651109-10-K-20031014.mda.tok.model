market risk the company s market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company manages foreign currency market risk  from time to time  through the use of a variety of financial and derivative instruments 
the company does not enter into any of these instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue 
rather  the company s objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses forward exchange contracts and other hedging activities to hedge the us dollar value resulting from anticipated foreign currency transactions 
the company s market risk on interest rates is the potential decrease in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential increase in interest rates 
see further discussion of these market risks below 
foreign currency during  the us dollar was generally weaker throughout the year relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which the company operates 
the weaker dollar had a positive impact on the company s international net sales results because the foreign denominated revenues translated into more us dollars 
it is not possible to determine the true impact of foreign currency translation changes  however  the direct effect on net sales and net earnings can be estimated 
for the year ended july   the impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an overall increase in net sales of million and an increase in net earnings of million 
foreign currency translation had a positive impact in europe  where the weaker us dollar relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulted in an increase of million on net sales and an increase of million on net earnings 
the weaker us dollar relative to the japanese yen also had a positive impact on foreign currency translation with an increase in net sales of million and an increase on net earnings of million 
the weaker us dollar relative to the south african rand also had a positive impact on foreign currency translation with an increase in net sales of million and an increase in net earnings of million 
in addition  the weaker us dollar relative to the australian dollar resulted in an increase of million in net sales and an increase of million on net earnings 
going forward  the company is planning for local currency results to remain strong 
the company maintains significant assets and operations in europe  countries of the asia pacific rim  south africa and mexico  resulting in exposure to foreign currency gains and losses 
a portion of the company s foreign currency exposure is naturally hedged by incurring liabilities  including bank debt  denominated in the local currency in which the company s foreign subsidiaries are located 
the foreign subsidiaries of the company purchase products and parts in various currencies 
as a result  the company may be exposed to cost increases relative to local currencies in the markets to which it sells 
to mitigate such adverse trends  the company  from time to time  enters into forward exchange contracts and other hedging activities 
additionally  foreign currency positions are partially offsetting and are netted against one another to reduce exposure 
some products made in the united states are sold abroad  primarily in canada 
as a result  sales of such products are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
any long term strengthening of the us dollar could depress these sales 
also  competitive conditions in the company s markets may limit its ability to increase product pricing in the face of adverse currency movements 
interest the company s exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments  short term borrowings and interest rate swap agreement 
we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risks on our long term debt obligations as a result of the fixed rate nature of the debt 
however  interest rate changes would affect the fair market value of the debt 
at july   the fair value of the company s long term debt approximates market 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately million 
the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting a portion of the company s interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a variable rate basis to hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap agreement is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as interest rates change 
the interest rate swap agreement entered into on june  has an aggregate notional amount of million maturing on july  the interest rate swap agreement entered into on march  has an aggregate notional amount of million maturing on august  the variable rate on both of the swaps is based on the current six month london interbank offered rates libor 
as of july   the interest rate swaps had a fair value of million  which is recorded net of the underlying debt in the liabilities section of the balance sheet 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recorded values of certain assets and liabilities 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to generally accepted accounting principles and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates and underlying accounting assumptions are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies that require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and are the most important to aid in fully understanding its financial results are the following allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by management based on evaluation of potential losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of this reserve requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have an effect on reserve balances required 
inventory the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for shrink and obsolescence are estimated using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  including issues related to specific inventory items 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have an effect on reserve balances required 
product warranty the company estimates warranty costs using standard quantitative measures based on historical warranty claim experience and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer warranty issues 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the future could impact these determinations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense within the tax provision is included in the statement of operations 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels 
employee benefit plans the company incurs expenses relating to employee benefits such as noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care benefits 
in accounting for these employment costs  management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates  discount rates  overall company compensation increases  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
the company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances when determining these estimates
