item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies we have identified the most critical accounting policies for our company 
these critical policies involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments and consist of warranty reserves  sales return reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  and intangible asset valuation 
warranty reserves the product warranty reserve includes the cost to manufacture raw materials  labor and overhead or purchase warranty parts from our suppliers as well as the cost to ship those parts to our customers 
in addition  the cost of a technician to install a warranted part on our manufactured commercial equipment is also included 
the warranty reserve is based on our historical experience with each product 
a warranty reserve is established for new products based on historical experience with similar products  adjusted for any technological advances in manufacturing or materials used 
thorough testing of new products in the development stage helps to identify and correct potential warranty issues prior to manufacturing 
continuing quality control efforts during manufacturing limit our exposure to warranty claims 
we track warranty claims by part and reason for claim in order to identify any potential warranty trends 
if our quality control efforts were to fail to detect a fault in one of our products  we could experience an increase in warranty claims resulting in an increase in the warranty reserve 
in addition  if we were to experience a significant number of warranty claims for a particular part or for a particular reason  we may need to make design changes to our product  some of which may be required for our warranted products 
a change in warranty experience could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sales return reserves the sales return reserve is based on our historical experience of product returns during the trial period in which a customer can return a product for the full purchase price  less shipping and handling in most instances 
the trial periods for bowflex  champion nutrition  and nautilus sleep systems product lines are six weeks  days  and days  respectively 
trial periods are not offered on our other product lines 
we track all product returns in order to identify any potential customer satisfaction trends 
our return reserve may be sensitive to a change in our customers ability to pay during the trial period due to unforeseen economic circumstances and to different product introductions that might fulfill the customers needs at a perceived better value 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may increase sales returns  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our historical experience adjusted for any known uncollectible amounts 
we periodically review the creditworthiness of our customers to help ensure collectibility 
our allowance is sensitive to changes in our customers ability to pay due to unforeseen changes in the economy  including the bankruptcy of a major customer  our efforts to actively pursue collections  and increases in chargebacks 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may result in increasing the allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inventory valuation our inventory is valued at either the lower of cost standard or average depending on location or market 
inventory adjustments are required for any known obsolete or defective products 
we periodically review inventory levels of our product lines in conjunction with market trends to assess salability of our products 
our assessment of necessary adjustments to market value of inventory is sensitive to changes in fitness technology and competitor product offerings driven by customer demand 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may result in reductions to market value of inventory below cost  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
intangible asset valuation intangible assets predominantly consist of the nautilus  schwinn  and stairmaster trademarks and goodwill associated with the acquisition of schwinn fitness 
management estimates affecting these trademark and goodwill valuations include determination of useful lives  and estimates of future cash flows and fair values to perform the annual impairment analysis 
the useful lives assigned by management to the nautilus  schwinn  and stairmaster trademarks and schwinn fitness goodwill are indefinite  years  indefinite  and indefinite  respectively 
any major change in the useful lives and or the determination of an impairment associated with the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets may result in asset value write downs  which could have a significant impact on our current and future financial position and results of operations 
results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies experiencing rapid growth and  in particular  rapidly growing companies that operate in evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 
although we have experienced net sales growth in recent years  our net sales growth may not continue  and we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability 
the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative royalties total operating expenses operating income other income income before income taxes income tax expense net income comparison of the years ended december  and december  net sales net sales increased by to million in from million in excluding our acquisitions of schwinn fitness and stairmaster  sales grew by approximately on a consolidated basis in compared to the increase in sales was driven by the growth in our direct segment and continued expansion of our commercial retail business 
sales in our direct segment are comprised primarily of sales from our bowflex product line 
however  as sales from our nautilus sleep systems product line continue to grow  they have become an increasingly important component of our direct segment business 
sales within our direct segment were million in  an increase of over a significant reason for the increase in direct segment sales can be attributed to the introduction of our high end bowflex ultimate at the end of the fourth quarter of the ultimate has been well received by consumers leading to sequential growth in the average selling price of our bowflex product line in each quarter since its introduction 
the average bowflex selling price increased in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in our direct marketing business is largely dependent upon national cable television advertising 
we experienced changes in the advertising environment in the second half of as costs rose for the first time in two years due to heightened demand for advertising time 
as a result of this higher advertising cost environment  fourth quarter direct segment revenue showed year over year growth but not sequential growth as we managed our advertising spending to optimize profitability 
we believe two unusual events affected sales in late and the first half of the nesting effect as a result of the events of september  and the high availability of television advertising time 
both of these contributed very positively to bowflex sales during the first half of as evidenced by results in the last part of  the nesting effect of september  seems to be receding  and the advertising environment has changed considerably 
our direct segment accounted for of our aggregate net sales in  down from in  as we continued our strategies of diversification into the commercial and retail markets and of introducing new direct marketed products 
sales within our commercial retail segment were million in  an increase of over a significant portion of this growth is attributed to the acquisition of schwinn fitness in september and stairmaster in february our commercial retail segment now accounts for of our net sales  up from in as we continue to execute our strategy of expanding our presence  product lines  and brands across all our channels  especially within the commercial retail segment 
in august of  we expanded our product lines with the introduction of new retail products 
the new retail products branded under our nautilus name include treadmills  stationary bicycles  an elliptical motion trainer  home strength equipment  and heart rate monitors 
we also introduced new products under our schwinn brand name including indoor cycling bicycles and an elliptical motion trainer 
in addition to the new retail products  many of our existing products were updated and enhanced 
we began shipping the majority of our new products late in the fourth quarter of we believe our business will continue to show considerable seasonality going forward 
in our direct marketing business we have found that second quarter influences on television viewership  such as the broadcast of national network season finales and seasonal weather factors  cause our spot television commercials on national cable television to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods of the year 
additionally  we have found that advertising availability during the fourth quarter is more limited due to an increase in annual holiday advertising and political advertisements during election years 
our retail business is also highly seasonal 
we believe that sales within our commercial retail segment are considerably lower in the second quarter of the year compared to the other quarters 
our strongest quarter for the commercial retail segment is generally the fourth quarter  followed by the first and third quarters 
we believe the principal reason for this trend is the commercial retail fitness industry s preparation for the impact of new year s fitness resolutions and seasonal weather patterns related to colder winter months 
gross profit gross profits continued to be strong  growing to million in from million in however  due to our product diversification strategy  which has increased sales of inherently lower margin products in the commercial retail segment  our overall gross profit margin decreased to in  compared to in we expect this trend to continue as we increase sales in the commercial retail segment of the market relative to our total sales 
the gross profit margin within our direct segment was in and in gross margins on our bowflex product line continue to be very strong as we gain cost reductions from vendors and shipping cost savings 
for example  the standard cost for the bowflex power pro with a pound rod pack was reduced approximately by the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in in addition  product delivery costs were reduced by approximately by the end of the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in the decrease in gross profit margin within our commercial retail segment to in  compared with in  was largely due to the schwinn fitness and stairmaster acquisitions 
other downward pressure on commercial retail margins included discounts offered on sales of discontinued retail products and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with moves and the consolidation of our treadmill facilities 
discounts were offered to reduce inventory levels of older products in order to accommodate new retail fitness products that were introduced during the third quarter 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase in selling and marketing expenses resulted primarily from the expansion of our direct marketing campaign for bowflex products and nautilus sleep systems  higher advertising costs in the second half of due to increased demand for advertising time  and the acquisitions of schwinn fitness and stairmaster 
advertising costs for our direct marketing segment rose for the first time in about two years  and we expect costs to remain at higher levels during we experienced an increase of approximately in advertising costs from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of we expect to materially increase our cash expenditures on spot commercials and infomercials as we anticipate rates to remain higher than we experienced in the first half of and as we expand the direct marketing campaigns for our nautilus sleep systems as well as our new treadclimber  which we introduced in the first quarter of as a percentage of net sales  overall selling and marketing expenses decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily a result of executing our product diversification strategy leading to a higher proportion of commercial retail segment sales 
selling and marketing expenses within our direct segment were of net sales in  compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses grew to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
our commercial retail segment accounted for million of the increase due primarily to our schwinn fitness and stairmaster acquisitions 
our direct segment accounted for the remaining increase of million due primarily to increased staffing and infrastructure expenses necessary to support our growth 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased marginally to in from in royalties 
royalty expense grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
both our direct and commercial retail segments have several royalty agreements 
the increase in our royalty expenses is primarily attributable to the increased sales of our bowflex products  along with sales of other products under royalty agreements that have been added as part of our diversification strategy 
the patent for the bowflex power rod resistance technology expires on april  the company will no longer be obligated to pay royalties related to bowflex sales following the expiration of this patent 
other income in  other income was million compared to million for this decline resulted primarily from a decrease in interest earned on invested cash and cash equivalents 
because we used a significant portion of our cash for acquisitions and stock buybacks  we had less cash from which to derive interest income 
interest income also decreased due to interest rate cuts by the federal reserve bank in income tax expense income tax expense increased by million for primarily due to the growth in our income before taxes 
the decrease in our effective tax rate from in to in is due to state income tax issues relating to our commercial and retail business increasing our rate while the rate is in line with our historical experience 
we expect our income tax expense to increase in line with our growth in income before taxes 
net income for the reasons discussed above  net income grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
our net income as a percentage of sales  though down from in  was a strong in the expansion of our commercial retail segment business and product lines during resulted in a decline in net income as a percentage of sales  but increased net income in real dollars 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  net sales net sales grew by to million in from million in sales were driven by the growth in our direct segment and our continued expansion into the commercial and retail market segments 
in  we capitalized on favorable advertising costs and availability to increase the consumer awareness of our bowflex and nautilus sleep system product lines 
meanwhile  we continued to expand our market share in the commercial retail products segment  where we grew the nautilus brand and successfully integrated the acquisition of the schwinn fitness business 
sales in our direct segment were comprised primarily of sales of our bowflex product line  however  as the nautilus sleep systems product line continued to grow  it also became an increasingly important component of our direct business 
sales within our direct products segment were million in  an increase of over the prior year 
our direct segment accounted for of our aggregate net sales in  down from in  as we continued our strategies of diversification into the commercial and retail products segments and of introducing new direct marketed products 
sales within our commercial retail products segment were million in  an increase of over our commercial retail segment accounted for of our net sales  up from in as we continued to execute our strategy of expanding our presence  product lines and brands across all our channels and especially within the commercial retail products segment 
gross profit gross profits continued to be strong  growing to million in  from million in the same period a year ago 
however  due to our product diversification strategy  which increased sales in the commercial retail segment  and due to the inherent lower margins in that segment  our overall gross profit margin decreased to in  from in the gross profit margin within our direct products segment was in and in the decrease in gross margins within our commercial retail products segment to in  compared with in  was largely due to the schwinn fitness acquisition and higher research and development expenditures for the nautilus retail fitness products 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase in selling and marketing expenses resulted primarily from the expansion of our direct marketing campaign for bowflex products and nautilus sleep systems and variable costs associated with our sales growth 
as a percentage of net sales  overall selling and marketing expenses decreased to in from in the decrease was a result of our planned product diversification efforts leading to a higher proportion of commercial retail product sales 
we also benefited from the increased availability of advertising time and the reduction of advertising rates due to the dramatic reduction of dot 
com media spending  the effects of september   and the economic downturn 
selling and marketing expenses within our direct products segment were of net sales in  compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
our direct segment business accounted for million of the increase  due primarily to increased staffing and infrastructure expenses necessary to support our growth 
our commercial retail operations accounted for the remaining increase primarily due to our product diversification strategy 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in royalties 
royalty expense grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
both our direct and commercial retail segments have several royalty agreements 
the increase in our royalty expenses was primarily attributable to the increased sales of our bowflex products  along with sales of other products under royalty agreements that have been added as part of our diversification strategy 
other income in  other income was million compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on invested cash and cash equivalents due to higher invested cash amounts 
the increase was somewhat offset by considerable interest rate cuts by the federal reserve bank in income tax expense income tax expense increased by million for primarily due to the growth in our income before taxes 
the increase in our effective tax rate to in from in was due to state income tax issues relating to our commercial retail business segment 
net income for the reasons discussed above  net income grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
not only were we able to maintain a high sales growth rate  but we also complemented that with control over our expenses  which grew only marginally as a percentage of sales from higher sales  coupled with controlling our expenses  translated into strong net income growth in quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read together with our audited financial statements and the related notes 
these operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period 
due to recent acquisitions within our commercial retail segment  we expect heightened seasonality in our business 
we expect sales in the second quarter to be weakest while the first and fourth quarter should be our strongest 
the fourth quarter should be stronger than the first quarter 
quarter ended in thousands except per share march june september december total fiscal net sales      gross profit      operating income      net income      earnings per share basic diluted fiscal net sales      gross profit      operating income      net income      earnings per share basic diluted reflects the three for two stock splits effective january and august liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth and acquisitions primarily from cash generated by our operating activities 
during  our operating activities generated million in net cash  which contributed to an aggregate million balance in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments  compared with million and million net cash generated by our operating activities in and  respectively 
net cash used in our investing activities decreased in to million  from million in  which was up substantially from million in the activity was primarily due to capital expenditures of million and the acquisition of stairmaster for million  net of cash acquired 
the activity was primarily the acquisition of schwinn fitness for million  including acquisition costs and million of net purchases of short term investments 
our capital expenditures in primarily consisted of land and buildings  manufacturing equipment  and computer systems and related equipment 
we invested million in capital expenditures for our direct segment computer systems and related equipment to support the growth of the business 
we purchased land and a building in colorado for million  including improvements  which serve as the commercial retail segment headquarters 
we also purchased land and buildings in texas and virginia for million  including improvements  which serve as manufacturing and warehouse facilities 
we invested million in tooling for manufacturing our new products 
we invested million at our corporate headquarters in washington to consolidate our washington operations and to expand our call center 
finally  we invested million in for net purchases of short term investments 
net cash used in financing activities increased to million from million in and million in increased use of funds for stock repurchases during and resulted in the increase in net cash used 
in we repurchased million of stock and received million for stock option exercises 
in we repurchased million of stock and received million for stock option exercises 
our working capital needs have increased as we continue to implement our growth strategy 
working capital in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that our working capital requirements will increase going forward as a result of us growing our commercial retail segment through our acquisition strategy and internal growth 
we also expect to materially increase our cash expenditures on spot commercials and infomercials as we expect advertising rates to remain higher than we experienced in the first half of and as we expand the direct marketing campaigns for our nautilus sleep systems and our newly introduced treadclimber 
commercial retail segment inventories increased in anticipation of increased sales  especially of new products and the addition of inventories associated with the acquisition of stairmaster 
the million increase in trade receivables can primarily be attributed to the fourth quarter sales in being heavily back end loaded as most of the new retail products were received for sale late in the quarter 
also contributing to the increase in receivables was the acquisition of stairmaster 
we expect that our working capital will increase going forward as a result of our anticipated future profitability 
we maintain a million line of credit with us bank national association 
the line of credit is secured by certain assets and contains several financial covenants 
as of the date of this filing  we are in compliance with the covenants applicable to the line of credit  and there is no outstanding balance under the line 
as of december   we had no contractual capital obligations or commercial commitments other than operating leases  which are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we announced a million stock repurchase program which expires june   and a annual stock dividend to be paid per quarter commencing march  we intend to use cash generated from operations to finance the dividend and any stock repurchase activity 
we believe our existing cash balances  cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation and price increases although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows or our financial position 
however  increases in inflation over historical levels or uncertainty in the general economy could decrease discretionary consumer spending for products like ours 
very little of our revenue growth is attributable to price increases 
risks and uncertainties while management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
a significant decline in availability of media time or a marked increase in advertising rates may hinder our ability to effectively market our products and may reduce profitability 
we depend primarily on second spot television commercials and minute television infomercials to market and sell our direct marketed products 
consequently  a marked increase in the price we must pay for our preferred media time or a reduction in its availability may adversely impact our financial performance 
unfavorable economic conditions or geopolitical upheaval could cause a decline in consumer spending and hinder our product sales 
the success of each of our products depends substantially on the amount of discretionary funds available to consumers and their purchasing preferences 
economic and political uncertainties could continue to adversely impact the us and international economic environment 
a continued decline in economic conditions could further depress consumer spending  especially discretionary spending for premium priced products like ours 
these poor economic conditions could in turn lead to substantial decreases in our net sales 
competition could increase significantly upon the expiration of the principal us patent on our bowflex power rod resistance technology on april  although our bowflex trademark is protected as long as we continuously use the trademark  the main us patent on our bowflex power rod resistance technology  a key component of our bowflex products  expires on april  this impending patent expiration is expected to trigger the introduction of similar products by competitors and could result in a significant decline in our net sales 
a significant decline in consumer interest in bowflex products would sharply diminish our sales and profitability 
our financial performance depends significantly on sales of our bowflex line of home fitness equipment 
during  approximately of our net sales were attributable to our bowflex products 
accordingly  any significant decline in consumer interest in our bowflex products could significantly reduce our sales and profitability 
sales of our bowflex line could significantly decline if  for example  a competing product were effectively marketed and resulted in significant consumer purchases or if the market demand for our bowflex line were to become saturated 
although we are working to diversify our revenue base  we anticipate that sales of our bowflex product line will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
new product development is an essential component of our growth strategy  an inability to successfully develop new products could negatively impact our future profitability 
our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire the rights to  and then effectively market and sell  new products that create and respond to new and evolving consumer demands 
accordingly  our net sales and profitability may be harmed if we are unable to develop  or acquire the rights to  new and different products that satisfy our marketing criteria 
in addition  any new products that we market may not generate sufficient net sales or profits to recoup their development or acquisition cost 
we also may not be able to successfully acquire intellectual property rights or potentially prevent others from claiming that we have violated their proprietary rights when we launch new products 
we could incur substantial costs in defending against such claims  even if they are without basis  and we could become subject to judgments requiring us to pay substantial damages 
we have been a rapidly growing company  our failure to properly manage growth may adversely affect our financial performance 
we have grown significantly in recent years  with an increase in net sales from million in to million in our organic growth has been complemented by acquisitions of nautilus in january  schwinn fitness in september  and stairmaster in february our rapid growth and recent acquisitions may strain our management team  production facilities  information systems and other resources 
in addition  we may be unable to effectively allocate our existing and future resources to our various businesses while maintaining our focus on our core competencies 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in effectively managing our existing operations or our anticipated growth  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position 
protecting our intellectual property is an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industries 
if we do not or are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we currently hold a number of patents and trademarks and have several patent and trademark applications pending 
however  our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and applicable laws provide only limited protection 
if we are unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations  we may not achieve anticipated revenue  earnings and business synergies 
we face significant challenges in integrating acquired businesses into our operations  particularly with respect to corporate cultures and management teams 
failure to successfully effect the integration could adversely impact the revenue  earnings and business synergies we expect from the acquisitions 
in addition  the process of integrating acquired businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  our core business 
our future integration efforts may be jeopardized  and our actual return on investment from such acquisitions may be lower than anticipated  as a result of various factors  including the following o challenges in the successful integration of the products  services or personnel of the acquired business into our operations  o loss of employees or customers that are key to the acquired business  o time and money spent by our management team focusing on the integration  which could distract it from our core operations  o our potential lack of experience in markets of the acquired businesses  o possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement our financial  accounting  information and other systems  and o the need to coordinate geographically diverse operations 
we depend on a single tier one consumer finance company to provide financing packages to our customers  a deterioration of the consumer finance market or failure by the finance company to provide financing to our customers could negatively impact sales of our direct marketed products 
in purchasing our products  approximately of our direct marketed customers utilize convenient financing packages provided by an independent finance company 
we believe that convenient consumer financing is an important tool in our direct marketing efforts and induces many of our customers to make purchases when they otherwise would not 
we facilitate the availability of convenient financing to our customers in order to increase our sales 
consumers may be less likely to purchase our products if the consumer finance market were to deteriorate so that financing is less available or less convenient to our customers 
in addition  we currently utilize the services of a single top tier consumer finance company 
although we believe we could enter into similar arrangements with other providers if needed  a failure by the current provider to adequately service our customers could temporarily disrupt sales 
a deterioration in product quality or increase in product liability could adversely affect our business 
we rely on third party manufacturers for a significant portion of our product components  and we may not be able to consistently control the quality of such components 
any material increase in the quantity of products returned by our customers for purchase price refunds could adversely affect revenues 
in addition  we are subject to potential product liability claims if our products injure  or allegedly injure  our customers or other users 
our financial performance could be affected if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover warranty claims on our products 
we could become liable for significant monetary damages if our product liability insurance coverage and reserves fail to cover future product liability claims 
government regulatory actions could disrupt our direct marketing efforts and product sales 
various federal  state and local government authorities  including the federal trade commission and the consumer products safety commission  regulate our direct marketing efforts and products 
our sales and profitability could be significantly harmed if any of these authorities commence a regulatory enforcement action that interrupts our direct marketing efforts or results in a product recall 
changes in foreign conditions could impair our international sales 
a portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the united states 
as of december   international sales represented approximately of consolidated net sales 
in addition  a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade restrictions  import and export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries

beginning in the fourth quarter of  recorded goodwill and indefinite life intangibles were tested as part of an annual impairment test as prescribed by sfas no 
the company found no instances of impairment of its recorded goodwill or indefinite life intangibles 
more frequent testing will be performed if material changes in events or circumstances arise 
sfas no

sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and expands on the guidance provided by sfas no 
with respect to cash flow estimations 
sfas no 
was effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of sfas no

in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
this statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
is an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescinds fin no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have primarily invested cash with banks and in liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity dates of less than one year 
our bank deposits may exceed federally insured limits  and there is risk of loss of the entire principal with any debt instrument 
to reduce risk of loss  we limit our exposure to any one debt issuer and require certain minimum ratings for debt instruments that we purchase 
foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk from currency fluctuations  mainly in europe 
given the relative size of the company s current foreign operations  the company does not believe the exposure to changes in applicable foreign currencies to be material  such that it could have a significant impact on our current or near term financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
management estimates the maximum impact on stockholders equity of a change in any applicable foreign currency to be million 
interest rate risk the company has financed its growth through cash generated from operations 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings and was not subject to any interest rate risk 
the company invests in liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity dates of less than one year 
due to the short term nature of those investments  management believes that any possible near term changes in related interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
