in the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company estimates the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which are not readily apparent from other sources 
the primary estimates underlying the company s financial statements include allowances for potential bad debts on accounts and notes receivable  the useful lives and recoverability of its assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments  the realizable value of its tax assets and other matters 
management bases its estimates on certain assumptions  which they believe are reasonable in the circumstances  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
although management does not believe that any change in those assumptions in the near term would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or the results of operation  differences in actual results could be material to the financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s financials 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical 
long lived assets the company annually assesses any impairment in value of long lived assets to be held and used 
the company evaluates the possibility of impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
if such cash flows are less than carrying value the company then reduces the asset to its fair value 
fair value is generally calculated using discounted cash flows 
various factors such as sales growth and operating margins and proceeds from a sale are part of this analysis 
future results could differ from the company s projections with a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
deferred income tax valuation allowance the company provides such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carry forwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets during  the fasb issued fas  which requires that for the company  effective september   goodwill  including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and certain other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life  cease amortizing 
fas requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit the company is being treated as one reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  the company performs internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables
