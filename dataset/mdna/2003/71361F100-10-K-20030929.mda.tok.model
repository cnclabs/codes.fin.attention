the company believes that available cash on hand and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund anticipated fiscal year cash flow requirements 
the company does not believe that inflation has significantly impacted historical operations and does not expect any significant near term inflationary impact 
the foregoing statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities act of  as amended 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement for a discussion of a number of uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statement 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
certain of the company s significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties  which affect the application of these policies and require the company to make estimates based on assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and underlying assumptions 
in the event estimates or underlying assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in the subsequent period to reflect more current information 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments or involve the greatest uncertainty 
accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk 
the company monitors its accounts receivable and charges to expense an amount equal to its estimate of potential credit losses 
the company considers a number of factors in determining its estimates  including  the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the use of different estimates for future credit losses would result in different charges to selling  general and administrative expense in each period presented and could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
provision is made to reduce inventories to net realizable value for excess and or obsolete inventory 
the company periodically reviews its inventory levels in order to identify obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the company estimates excess or obsolete inventory based principally upon contemplated future customer demand for the company s products and the timing of product upgrades 
the use of different assumptions in determining slow moving and obsolete inventories would result in different charges to cost of sales in each period presented and could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
deferred tax assets 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future income tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities  assuming they will be realized and settled at the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
this assessment includes consideration for the scheduled reversal of temporary taxable differences  projected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning 
if actual long term future taxable income is lower than the company s estimate  the company may be required to record material adjustments to the deferred tax assets  resulting in a charge to income in the period of determination and negatively impacting the company s results of operations and financial position for the period 
litigation and other contingencies 
the company is subject to various legal proceedings and other contingencies  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the company accrues for estimated losses if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company uses judgment and evaluates  with the assistance of legal counsel  whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be disclosed or recorded 
the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and so typically a loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  if the outcome of legal proceedings are different than is anticipated by the company  such as was the case in fiscal year with respect to an arbitration award against the company  described in item  legal proceedings the company would have to record a charge for the matter  generally in the full amount at which it was resolved  in the period resolved  negatively impacting the company s results of operations and financial position for the period 
market risk information perceptron s primary market risk is related to foreign exchange rates 
the foreign exchange risk is derived from the operations of its international subsidiaries  which are primarily located in germany and for which products are produced in the us the company may from time to time have interest rate risk in connection with its borrowings 
foreign currency risk the company has foreign currency exchange risk in its international operations arising from the time period between sales commitment and delivery for contracts in non us currencies 
for sales commitments entered into in the non us currencies  the currency rate risk exposure is predominantly less than one year with the majority in the to day range 
at june   the company s percentage of sales commitments in non us currencies was approximately or million 
the company may use  from time to time  a limited hedging program to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
these transactions involve the use of forward contracts 
these forward contracts  which typically mature within one year  are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions 
the company s forward exchange contracts do not subject it to material risk due to exchange rate movements  because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
the company may use forward exchange contracts to hedge the net assets of certain of its foreign subsidiaries to offset the translation and economic exposures related to the company s investment in these subsidiaries 
at june   the company had forward exchange contracts between the united states dollar and the euro in the notional amount of million 
the forward exchange contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and have a weighted average settlement price of euros to the united states dollar 
the contracts outstanding at june  mature through june  and are intended to hedge the company s investment in its german subsidiary 
the company recognized a charge of  in other comprehensive income loss for the unrealized change in value of these forward exchange contracts during the fiscal year ended june  during fiscal years and  the company did not engage in any hedging activities 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk in connection with any borrowings under its variable and fixed rate revolving lines of credit 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk would arise primarily from changes in the prime rate and changes in eurodollar rates in the london interbank market 
the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates

safe harbor statement certain statements in item  business  and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  including the company s expectation as to fiscal and future revenue  order bookings  costs and earnings level  the ability of the company to fund its fiscal year cash flow requirements and the company s ability to sustain engineering and research and development support for its products 
the company assumes no obligation for updating any such forward looking statements to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the dependence of the company s revenue on a number of sizable orders from a small number of customers  the timing of orders and shipments which can cause the company to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual revenue and operating results  timely receipt of required supplies and components which could result in delays in anticipated shipments  general product demand and market acceptance risks  the ability of the company to successfully compete with alternative and similar technologies  the timing and continuation of the automotive industry s retooling programs  including the risk that the company s customers postpone new tooling programs as a result of economic conditions or otherwise  the ability of the company to resolve technical issues inherent in the development of new products and technologies  the ability of the company to identify and satisfy market needs  general product development and commercialization difficulties  the ability of the company to attract and retain key personnel  especially technical personnel  the quality and cost of competitive products already in existence or developed in the future  the level of interest existing and potential new customers may have in new products and technologies generally  rapid or unexpected technological changes and the effect of economic conditions  particularly economic conditions in the domestic and worldwide automotive industry  which has from time to time been subject to cyclical downturns due to the level of demand for  or supply of  the products produced by companies in this industry 
the company s expectations regarding future bookings and revenues are based upon oral discussions with customers and are subject to change based upon a wide variety of factors  including economic conditions and system implementation delays 
certain of these new orders have been delayed in the past and could be delayed in the future 
because the company s products are typically integrated into larger systems or lines  the timing of new orders is dependent on the timing of completion of the overall system or line 
in addition  because the company s products have shorter lead times than other components and are required later in the process  orders for the company s products tend to be given later in the integration process
