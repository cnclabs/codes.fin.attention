table of contents critical accounting policies management of giga tronics has identified the following as the company s critical accounting policies revenue revenues are recognized when there is evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
this generally occurs when products are shipped and the risk of loss has passed 
upon shipment  the company also provides for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranties 
revenue related to products shipped subject to customers evaluation is recognized upon final acceptance 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company periodically reviews inventory on hand to identify and write down excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated product demand 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the net realizable value 
the company has estimated an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on analysis of outstanding receivables  consideration of the age of those receivables  and the company s historical collection experience 
deferred tax assets the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets  which may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets become deductible  management believes it more likely than not that the company will not realize benefits of these deductible differences as of march  management has  therefore  established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as of march  product development costs the company incurs pre production costs on certain long term supply arrangements 
the costs  which represent non recurring engineering and tooling costs  are capitalized as other assets and amortized over their useful life when reimbursable by the customer 
otherwise  they are expensed as incurred

giga tronics had working capital at year end of  compared to  in and  in the company s current ratio at march  was compared to in and in the decrease in working capital is primarily a result of the increased allowance against the deferred income tax benefit and its operating loss in the current year 

table of contents additions to property and equipment were  in  compared to  in and  in fiscal spending reflects continuing investments to support new product development  increased productivity  and improved product quality 
other cash inflows in  and consist of   and  respectively  from the sale of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
the company leases various facilities under various operating leases that expire through may total future minimum lease payments under these leases amount to approximately  as follows fiscal years in thousands thereafter the company is committed to purchase certain inventory under non cancelable purchase orders 
as of march   total non cancelable purchase orders were approximately  through fiscal and  beyond fiscal that are scheduled to be delivered to the company at various dates through july management believes that the company has adequate resources to meet its anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
giga tronics intends to increase research and development expenditures for the purpose of broadening its product base 
from time to time  giga tronics considers a variety of acquisition opportunities to also broaden its product lines and expand its markets 
such acquisition activity could also increase the company s operating expenses and require the additional use of capital resources 
outlook the commercial wireless telecommunications market continues to be weak 
all of our business segments have been impacted by the economic downturn currently affecting the test and measurement and semiconductor industries 
giga tronics is uncertain of the duration and severity of this downturn in the markets we serve and the ultimate impact this will have on the company 
new orders in the military sector are showing strength  however new orders in many of our commercial markets have been severely impacted 
in response to the current market conditions  giga tronics has implemented cost reductions  which include personnel reductions  pay cuts across all of the divisions for existing employees and reductions in monthly lease payments for our facilities 
giga tronics will continue monitoring its cost structure in order to take the appropriate actions to reduce expenses and achieve profitability 
giga tronics remains fully committed to the investment in new product development to expand our product lines and update our existing lines with additional features 
while the microsource management hopes that prospects for new orders will improve results for the new fiscal year  its short term growth will be less than previously anticipated as there are timing delays associated with currently booked orders
