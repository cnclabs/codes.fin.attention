item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary rights and licenses we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and  while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
we have entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers and channel partners requiring the release of our source code under certain conditions 
generally  such agreements provide that such parties will have a limited  nonexclusive right to use such code in the event that there is an undismissed bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  if we cease to do business or if we materially fail to meet our contractual obligations 
the release of source code may increase the likelihood of misappropriation by third parties 
we currently have a small number of patents relating to our products  including eight united states patents and a number of patent applications pending in the united states and abroad 
there can be no assurance that our patents will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged by applicable governmental patent examiners  will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that other companies will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents owned by us 
in  the us patent and trademark office granted two requests for reexamination of our us patent no 
 the reexamination proceedings are currently pending 
an adverse outcome of the reexamination proceedings could involve loss of some or all of the claims of the patent 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion of this matter 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with our internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  any such software licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we distribute our products under software license agreements that grant customers a nonexclusive  nontransferable license to use our products and contain terms and conditions prohibiting the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our products 
generally  we do not provide end users with the source code for our products except under the escrow arrangements described above

hyperion was formed in august when arbor software  founded in  acquired hyperion software  founded in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from licensing our software products and providing maintenance  consulting and training services 
our standard software license agreement is a perpetual license to use our products on an end user  concurrent user or central processing unit basis 
we record revenue from licensing our software products to end users provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of the product has occurred  as prescribed by statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
for arrangements with multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements based upon the residual method in accordance with sop  modifications of sop with respect to certain transactions 
amounts billed or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
maintenance agreements are generally twelve month prepaid contracts that are recognized ratably over the service period 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is measured by the stated renewal rates included in the agreements 

table of contents customers may also enter into arrangements that are typically on a time and materials basis for consulting and training services 
vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services is based upon the standard hourly rate we charge for such services when sold separately 
training services are generally prepaid prior to rendering the service 
consulting and training revenues are typically recognized as earned 
consulting revenues are generated primarily from implementation services related to the installation of our products 
these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from the license revenue because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop our services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software 
our products are fully functional upon delivery of the product and implementation does not require significant modification or alteration 
factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include  but are not limited to degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
payments related to the software product to which the services relate are typically billed independently from the services and  therefore  are not coincident with performance of such services 
license agreements generally do not include acceptance provisions 
in the infrequent circumstance where an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements  license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts and accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered  services have been performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
license revenue from resellers or distributors is recognized upon sell through to the end customer 
if we determine that collection of a license fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are made at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these provisions  we analyze several factors  including our historical collection experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  we may record additional provisions for doubtful accounts 
we record the provision for doubtful accounts in general and administrative expense and as a reduction of revenue in order to match the underlying cause of the provision to the appropriate classification in our statement of operations 
for additional discussion of our provisions  refer to the section entitled liquidity and capital resources 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at june  and million at june  the total provision for doubtful accounts was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
of these provisions  million  million and million were recorded in general and administrative expense in fiscal  and  respectively  and million  million and million were recorded as a reduction of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we record an expense within the tax provision in our statements of operations 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily relating to foreign net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted on july  sfas requires us to review for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant decrease in the market value of the assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we assess the assets for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on the estimated future discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets and future results of operations could be adversely affected

the change in foreign exchange rates from fiscal to fiscal positively impacted fiscal revenues by approximately million  or of total revenues  primarily due to the strength of the euro against the us dollar 
the change in foreign exchange rates from fiscal to fiscal did not have a material impact on our fiscal results 

table of contents software licenses 
software license revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in license revenue in fiscal was primarily due to increased revenues from two of our newer  suite based application products  hyperion planning and hyperion financial management 
these two products were still in the early stages of their product life cycles during most of fiscal  but they began making significant contributions to total license revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal and into fiscal these increases in suite based application product sales were offset to some extent by declines in revenue from our older  standalone application products  hyperion pillar and hyperion enterprise  and our platform products 
the decrease in license revenue in fiscal resulted from a reduction in the total number of transactions 
this decline was primarily attributable to weak economic conditions both domestically and internationally  which caused delays in our customer s capital spending  as well as a drop in revenues from older generation products that was more rapid than the increase in newer generation product revenues 
we separate license revenue into two main components application license revenue and platform license revenue 
application license revenue is generated from our packaged business performance management applications  and platform license revenue is generated from our hyperion essbase xtd platform and its component products 
in fiscal  application revenue represented of total license revenue and platform revenue represented of total license revenue  compared to application revenue and platform revenue in fiscal and application revenue and platform revenue in fiscal a increase in suite based application sales in fiscal  which include hyperion planning and hyperion financial management  combined with a decrease in standalone application sales  which include hyperion pillar and hyperion enterprise  resulted in an overall increase in total application license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal however  platform sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in application license revenue combined with the decrease in platform license revenue resulted in the increase in the ratio of application license revenue to platform license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  a decrease in standalone application sales  partially offset by a increase in suite based application sales  resulted in an overall decrease in total application license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  platform sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal because platform sales decreased at a higher rate than application sales  the ratio of application license revenue to platform license revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal our two newer  suite based application products  hyperion planning and hyperion financial management  largely accounted for the increase in application license revenue as a percentage of total license revenue in fiscal we market our products through our direct sales force and through channel partners 
to date  we have generated the majority of our license revenue through our direct sales force  but we continue to focus on complementing our direct sales force with channel partners  which include oems  vars  system integrators and independent distributors 
license revenue from channel partners comprised of total license revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal no single channel partner represented more than of total revenue during fiscal  or maintenance and services 
maintenance and services revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal maintenance and services revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  maintenance revenue increased  primarily due to additional sales of software to our customers and improvements in our invoicing and collecting procedures for maintenance renewals  offset slightly by customers no longer renewing maintenance services contracts 
during fiscal and fiscal  we analyzed our customer portfolio to identify customers who may have been receiving maintenance services but were not paying for such services 
this initiative resulted in the recognition of maintenance revenues from billings to customers in fiscal for maintenance services provided in prior periods 
in fiscal  maintenance revenues increased due to additional sales of software to our customers and  to a lesser extent  to the improvements in our invoicing and collecting procedures for maintenance renewals discussed above 
consulting and training services revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal consulting revenue decreased in fiscal due to our continued focus on increasing the use of channel partners to provide consulting services for our customers 
as part of this effort  we reduced headcount in our north american consulting organization by approximately employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal and further reduced headcount by approximately employees during fiscal in fiscal  consulting revenue decreased due to our focus on increasing the use of channel partners to provide consulting services for our customers  as well as general economic weakness 

table of contents cost of revenues year ended june  gross gross gross in thousands margin margin margin software licenses maintenance and services cost of software license revenue 
cost of software license revenue consists primarily of royalty expenses  amortization of capitalized software development costs  amortization of acquired technologies  and the cost of product packaging and documentation materials 
cost of software license revenue in fiscal remained relatively flat compared to fiscal while software license revenue increased 
this was primarily due to a million decrease in royalty expenses due to a different mix of product sales and a million decrease in product packaging and documentation material costs due to our increased use of electronic product distribution 
these decreases were substantially offset by a million increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs and a million increase in amortization of acquired technologies 
in fiscal  the cost of software license revenue decreased compared to fiscal  primarily attributable to a million decrease in royalty expenses 
this decrease in royalty expenses resulted from the decrease in software license revenue in fiscal  as well as a change in the mix of product sales 
in fiscal  and  we capitalized million  million  and million of software development costs  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the amounts capitalized relate to localization costs for our software products 
capitalized software product development costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the products  which is generally three years 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs begins upon the general release of the software to customers 
cost of maintenance and services revenue 
cost of maintenance and services revenue consists largely of compensation and benefits for consulting  training and support personnel 
cost of maintenance and services revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in cost of maintenance and services revenue is primarily attributable to our continued focus on leveraging our channel partners to perform consulting services for our customers 
as a result of this effort  we reduced headcount in our north american consulting organization by approximately employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal and further reduced headcount by approximately employees during fiscal this reduction in headcount contributed to a million decrease in employee expenses for maintenance and services personnel in fiscal compared to fiscal further  independent contractor and temporary staffing expenses decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our decreased use of external personnel for product implementations for customers 
cost of maintenance and services revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in employee expenses 
this decrease in employee expenses was primarily due to our restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in significant decreases in salary and variable compensation expenses 
variable compensation also declined as a result of lower consulting revenues in fiscal gross margin on maintenance and services revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal these increases in gross margin are primarily due to the increases in maintenance revenue as a percentage of total maintenance and services revenue 
maintenance revenue as a percentage of total maintenance and services revenue increased in fiscal and due to maintenance revenue increases  as discussed above  as well as consulting revenue decreases due to our increased use of channel partners to provide consulting services 
operating expenses year ended june  percent of percent of percent of in thousands revenue revenue revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses 
table of contents sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in marketing expenses resulting from a heavier focus on a wide variety of demand generation activities 
we also increased spending in the area of brand building and the advancement of business performance management thought leadership 
sales and marketing expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the restructuring plan we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and related cost saving measures 
in fiscal  we consolidated our marketing activities into a centralized marketing organization to reduce overlap of marketing activities in an effort to support future revenue growth while at the same time control related expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreases in marketing expenses of million and decreases in salaries and related employee expenses of million 
research and development 
research and development expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in salaries and related employee expenses 
research and development expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the utilization of independent contractors and temporary staffing of million and decreases in salaries and related employee expenses of million 
we have focused our efforts in research and development on our core products  thereby reducing our reliance on independent contractors and reducing operating costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in bad debt expense resulting from improvements in the quality of our accounts receivable portfolio  a million decrease in outsourcing costs  as we ended the outsourcing of our north american accounting department in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million decrease in occupancy and equipment costs primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  as many fixed assets have become fully depreciated during the past several quarters  and a million decrease in charges related to property and sales tax audits 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in salaries and related employee expenses resulting primarily from headcount increases as we brought our north american accounting function in house 
general and administrative expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to decreases in professional services and independent contractor expenditures of million and a decrease in bad debt expense of million 
these decreases are the direct result of our reduction in discretionary spending  as well as our focus on invoicing and collection process improvements 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the restructuring charges in fiscal and resulted from adjustments made to the restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and  thus  did not represent new restructuring activities 
a summary of the fiscal restructuring and other charges and accrual balance is as follows in thousands asset severance facilities impairments other total initial charge cash paid non cash accrual balance at june  cash paid adjustments accrual balance at june  cash paid adjustments accrual balance at june  
table of contents as of june   we had communicated to all impacted employees regarding employee separation benefits and the timing of separation  and all positions had been separated or were in the separation process  resulting in cash payments of million 
additional payments of million were made during fiscal and the remaining severance payments of approximately million were paid in the first half of fiscal all restructuring activities related to the disposal and or impairment of long term assets were completed as of june   and all restructuring activities associated with the consolidation of facilities were completed by june  approximately million of the million restructuring and other charges recorded in fiscal did not require an outflow of cash  but the remaining million has required or will require the use of cash primarily payments due under long term lease obligations 
the accrual balance at june  of million  which relates primarily to future lease obligations  is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
of this amount  approximately million is included in other current liabilities and approximately million is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we substantially completed our restructuring activities related to the restructuring plan described above during fiscal  however payments due under long term lease obligations will continue to be made over the remaining lives of the leases 
if we are unable to maintain a cost structure that is in appropriate balance with revenue going forward  whether due to failure to increase revenue adequately or failure to keep costs down  we could find it necessary to further adjust our cost structure through the execution of additional restructuring plans 
interest and other income interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
although we had higher average cash and investment balances during fiscal compared to fiscal and  interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal due to declines in short term interest rates during fiscal and interest and other expense interest and other expense consists primarily of interest paid and amortization of deferred issuance costs related to our convertible subordinated notes due march interest and other expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during the first and second quarters of fiscal  we repurchased convertible subordinated notes with face values totaling million 
these repurchases significantly contributed to the decrease in interest and other expense in fiscal compared to fiscal interest and other expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal  we repurchased convertible subordinated notes with face values totaling million and million  respectively 
these repurchases significantly contributed to the decrease in interest and other expense in fiscal compared to fiscal gain on redemption of debt during fiscal  we repurchased convertible subordinated notes with face values totaling million for a total cost of approximately million  which resulted in a gain  net of the write off of associated deferred issuance costs  of approximately million

during fiscal  and  we invested our cash primarily in state and municipal bonds  us government and agency obligations  corporate notes and other highly liquid securities 
in fiscal  and  we generated positive cash flow from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal and compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the net income generated for these periods as well as decreases in accounts receivable  which resulted from our focus on invoicing and collection process improvements  primarily for maintenance and consulting services 
based on our improved collection results  we reduced our outstanding receivables to million at june  from million at june  and reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts to million at june  from million at june  our provisions for doubtful accounts were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the improvements in invoicing and collections processes also contributed to reductions in average quarterly days sales outstanding dso to days in fiscal  from days in fiscal and days in fiscal we calculate accounts receivable dso on a gross basis by dividing the accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter multiplied by days 
we continue to emphasize rapid billing and collection of receivables  however there can be no assurance that we will be able to further reduce  or even maintain the current average dso 
our dso can fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including the volume of revenue that is recognized toward the end of each quarter  the timing of annual maintenance billings during the fiscal year  customer payment terms  and the variability of quarterly revenue 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our license revenue since a large portion of our software licensing agreements are concluded in the last month of the each fiscal quarter  which will impact our accounts receivable balances  collections experience and dso

our capital expenditures in fiscal  and consisted primarily of purchases of resources to manage our operations  including computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements 
the higher level of purchases of property and equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal and was attributable to the acquisition of several critical business systems during fiscal  including our erp platform and vantive and callidus software

these amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million in fiscal we intend to fund our capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as well as cash generated from future operations  if any 
however  capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of development projects and increases in operating expenses  all of which are subject to uncertainty 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  and cash generated from our future operations  if any  will be sufficient to finance our business through at least june  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations will be impacted by changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products as well as our ability to manage operating expenses and achieve further operational efficiencies

related party transactions in fiscal and  siebel systems purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of software  maintenance and services from us for purposes of implementing an enterprise wide financial planning system 
in addition  siebel has a future option to purchase the same products in accordance with normal contractual terms and conditions 
the chief financial officer of siebel was on our board of directors from june to february as of june   all amounts due from siebel related to these transactions had been paid 
in fiscal and  we purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of software  maintenance and services from siebel for purposes of implementing a worldwide customer relationship management system 
as of june   we had a payable to siebel in the amount of million related to these transactions 

table of contents factors that may affect future results we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
risks unrelated to the pending acquisition of brio product enhancement and new product introductions involve inherent risks 
hyperion competes in a market characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware and software development  evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
hyperion continually seeks to expand and refresh its product offerings to include newer features or products  and enter into agreements allowing integration of third party technology into hyperion s products 
the introduction of new products or updated versions of continuing products has inherent risks  including  but not limited to product quality  including the possibility of software defects  the fit of the new products and features with the customer s needs  the successful adaptation of third party technology into hyperion s products  educating hyperion s sales  marketing and consulting personnel to work with the new products and features  competition from earlier and more established entrants  market acceptance of initial product releases  marketing effectiveness  and the accuracy of assumptions about the nature of customer demand 
hyperion s failure to successfully introduce  market and sell new products and technologies  enhance and improve existing products in a timely manner  and properly position and or price hyperion s products  and undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of a product and or the failure of anticipated market growth could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations or financial position 
these risks tend to be greater when newer products  such as hyperion financial management and hyperion planning  make up a larger portion of the overall product mix 
as more and more of these newer products are deployed  hyperion s service and maintenance organizations  along with its partners  will have to rapidly increase their ability to install and service these products  and hyperion must rapidly improve their ease of implementation and ease of use 
the failure to successfully increase these capacities and make these improvements could result in significantly lower customer satisfaction  which could lead to lower license revenue 
failure to upgrade older products will adversely affect revenue 
as newer products are introduced by hyperion  or by its competition  the market s demand for hyperion s older products declines 
declining demand reduces revenue from additional licenses  and reduces maintenance revenue from past purchasers of hyperion s software 
we must continually upgrade hyperion s older products in order for hyperion s customers to continue to see value in hyperion s maintenance services 
if hyperion is unable to provide continued improvements in functionality  or  alternatively  move customers with hyperion s older products to hyperion s newer products  declining maintenance and new license revenue from older products could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business 
if hyperion is unable to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance  hyperion may be unable to recoup product development costs  and hyperion s earnings and revenue may decline 
hyperion s future success depends on its ability to address the rapidly changing needs of its customers by developing and introducing new products  product updates and services on a timely basis 
hyperion must also extend the operation of its products to new platforms and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
hyperion commits substantial resources to developing new software products and services 
if the markets for these new products do not develop as anticipated  or demand for hyperion s products and services in these markets does not materialize or occurs more slowly than hyperion expects  hyperion will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenue  and hyperion s business and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents hyperion operates in a very competitive environment 
the markets in which hyperion competes are intensely competitive  highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
hyperion has experienced  and expects it will continue to experience  vigorous competition from current competitors and new competitors  some of whom may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than hyperion does 
cognos competes with hyperion across a wide range of products  offering what they refer to as corporate performance management solutions  as do  generally  the major erp vendors  including sap and oracle 
many other companies compete in specific areas of hyperion s business 
sas and peoplesoft have olap products and analytic applications  business objects and crystal have query and reporting products  and numerous smaller vendors offer specific applications that compete with a single hyperion product 
hyperion expects additional competition as other established and emerging companies  including microsoft and peoplesoft  enter into both the application and platform parts of the business performance management software market 
this competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would materially adversely affect hyperion s business  operating results and financial condition 
hyperion typically has back ended quarters 
quarterly revenues and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of the signing of licensing agreements and product deliveries during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
significant portions of hyperion s quarterly software licensing agreements are concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter  generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final week of that month 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain costs  including personnel and facilities expenses  a decline or shortfall in quarterly and or annual revenues typically results in lower profitability or may result in losses 
prior to the very end of any quarter  hyperion must rely on hyperion s forecasts of revenue for planning  modeling and other purposes 
however  forecasts are only estimates and may not correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
consequently  a significant discrepancy between actual results and sales forecasts could cause hyperion to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect hyperion s business or results of operations 
any publicly stated revenue or earnings projections by hyperion are especially subject to this risk 
a change in pricing or marketing could adversely affect hyperion s business 
in an effort to simplify and clarify hyperion s product positioning and marketing  hyperion periodically makes changes to hyperion s product pricing or product descriptions 
while hyperion does not believe these pricing and marketing changes will have a material impact on license revenue  broadly based changes to pricing or marketing messages could cause customers to change or delay their purchasing decisions in response to such revisions 
additional risks of such changes include delays in transactions as hyperion s sales force learns how to deploy the new pricing or convey hyperion s new marketing messages and delay or loss of revenues as the competition reacts to the pricing and marketing changes  any of which could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations or financial position 
hyperion may not be able to continue its operational improvements 
as part of hyperion s focus on improving its operating margins  hyperion is driving toward increased efficiencies in hyperion s sales force  as well as hyperion s services  product development  product marketing  finance  and other administrative processes 
the ability to continue to realize current efficiencies and find ways to improve on past performance is crucial to the improvement of operating margins 
any increase in the relative cost of these functions  or failure to continue to realize current efficiencies  could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s profits 
reorganizations may adversely affect productivity 
hyperion has continued to make adjustments to hyperion s operations and organization 
these changes have historically resulted in productivity issues in the short term 
the revised operations and or organization must keep improving over past performance in order to provide better operating margins and efficiencies 
failure to maintain or improve momentum and productivity could materially adversely impact hyperion s revenue and profits 

table of contents hyperion s international operations are subject to significant risks 
hyperion derives a substantial portion of its revenue from customers located outside of the united states  and hyperion plans to expand its international operations 
hyperion s international operations are subject to risks  including potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  imposition of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and employment restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates and inflation  which could reduce hyperion s customers ability to obtain financing for software products or which could make hyperion s products more expensive in those countries  difficulties in hedging foreign currency transaction exposures  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in staffing and managing its international operations  including difficulties related to administering hyperion s stock option plan in some foreign countries  difficulties in coordinating the activities of hyperion s geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations  competition from local suppliers  costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages  and political unrest  war or terrorism  particularly in areas in which hyperion has facilities 
hyperion may not be able to successfully address each of these challenges 
additionally  hyperion conducts a significant portion of its business in currencies other than the united states dollar 
hyperion s operating results are  therefore  subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
hyperion s revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the united states dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the united states dollar weakens 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the euro  relative to the value of the united states dollar positively affected revenues and operating results in fiscal if the united states dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  our revenues and operating results will be adversely affected 
there are significant organizational and product integration risks related to business combinations 
in addition to its proposed acquisition of brio  hyperion has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  mergers with  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
there are risks involved in these activities  including but not limited to the possibility that hyperion pays more than the value it derives from the acquisition  the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  the possibility that all aspects of the integration are not completed or that all of the anticipated synergies of the acquisition are not realized  the potential product liability associated with selling the acquired company s products  and the potential disruption of hyperion s ongoing business and the distraction of management from hyperion s business 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations or financial position  especially in the case of a large acquisition 
hyperion is subject to the possibility of infringement claims 
hyperion expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in hyperion s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
both hyperion and brio have in the past been subjected to patent infringement claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and may require the payment of substantial amounts of money 
in the event of a successful product infringement claim against hyperion  and hyperion s failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  hyperion s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents enforcement of hyperion s intellectual property rights may be difficult 
hyperion relies primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect hyperion s proprietary rights 
hyperion s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate 
hyperion s stock price may be volatile 
the market price of hyperion s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations 
the market price of hyperion s common stock may be significantly affected by factors  including but not limited to the announcement of new products  product enhancements or technological innovation by hyperion or hyperion s competitors  announcements of acquisitions by hyperion  changes in hyperion s or hyperion s competitors results of operations  changes in revenue  revenue growth rates and revenue mix  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
technology stocks have experienced wide fluctuations in prices  which sometimes have been unrelated to their operating performance 
the market price of hyperion s common stock could be adversely affected by such fluctuations 
hyperion is dependent upon indirect channel partners 
in addition to its direct sales force  hyperion relies on indirect channel partners such as oems  vars and distributors for licensing and support of its products in the united states and internationally 
license revenue from channel partners comprised of hyperion s total license revenue for fiscal this channel involves a number of special risks  including hyperion s lack of control over the delivery of its products to end users  hyperion s resellers and distributors may terminate their relationship with hyperion on short notice  and hyperion s resellers and distributors may market and distribute competing products 
hyperion s current indirect channel partners may not elect  or be able  to market or support hyperion s products effectively or be able to release their products embedded with hyperion products in a timely manner 
hyperion may not be able to effectively manage channel conflicts  and economic conditions or industry demand may adversely affect these or other indirect channel partners or these indirect channel partners may devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
revenues derived from indirect channel partners may fluctuate significantly in subsequent periods 
hyperion is exposed to product liability claims 
hyperion s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit hyperion s exposure to potential product liability claims  and hyperion carries insurance to protect against such claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in hyperion s license agreements may not be effective as a result of us or foreign laws or ordinances enacted in the future or because of judicial decisions  and that liability insurance may not be available  or that coverage for specific claims may be denied 
although hyperion has not experienced any material product liability claims to date  the sale and support of business performance management products by hyperion may entail the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability claim brought against hyperion could have a material adverse effect upon hyperion s business  operating results and financial condition 
defects in hyperion s products could increase its costs  adversely affect its reputation  diminish demand for its products and hurt its operating results 
as a result of their complexity  hyperion s software products may contain undetected errors or viruses 
errors in new products or product enhancements might not be detected until after initiating commercial shipments  which could result in additional costs  delays  possible damage to hyperion s reputation and could cause diminished demand for hyperion sproducts 
this could lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduce the opportunity to renew maintenance or sell new licenses 
some provisions in hyperion s charter documents and its stockholder rights plan may prevent or deter an acquisition of hyperion 
some of the provisions in hyperion s charter documents may deter or prevent certain corporate actions  such as a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could affect the market value of hyperion s securities 
these provisions include 
table of contents hyperion s board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with any rights it may determine 
consequently  hyperion s board of directors may issue preferred stock  without shareholder approval  that has rights superior to the outstanding hyperion common stock  hyperion s board of directors is classified into three groups  with each group of directors to hold office for three years  which has the effect that two annual meetings  not one  are required to replace a majority of hyperion s board of directors  hyperion stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes for directors  and special meetings of hyperion stockholders may be called only by hyperion s president or by the president or secretary upon written request by a majority of the board of directors and may not be called by hyperion s stockholders 
hyperion has in place a stockholder rights plan that is designed to discourage coercive takeover offers 
in general  hyperion s stockholder rights plan makes it uneconomic for any person to acquire more than a interest in hyperion without the consent of the hyperion board of directors 
hyperion s board of directors could utilize the provisions of its charter documents and stockholder rights plan to resist an offer from a third party to acquire hyperion  including an offer to acquire hyperion common stock at a premium to its trading price or an offer that is otherwise considered favorable by hyperion stockholders 
risks related to the pending acquisition of brio hyperion may face challenges in integrating brio with hyperion and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition and the price of hyperion common stock may be adversely affected 
hyperion may not be successful in integrating brio s business 
achieving the benefits of the acquisition will depend on many factors  including the successful and timely integration of the products  technology and sales operations of the two companies following the completion of the acquisition  managing software development activities to define a combined product roadmap  ensure timely release of innovative products to market  and to ensure timely development of product roadmaps  release of products to market  and the development of efficient integration and migration processes and tools  combining product offerings  platforms and technologies quickly and effectively  demonstrating to our existing and potential customers that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business focus  retaining key alliances on attractive terms with partners and suppliers  coordinating and integrating sales and marketing efforts to effectively communicate the capabilities of the combined company  cross selling related products to each other s customers  and managing the combined sales force and distribution channels to avoid channel conflict  maintaining employee morale  assimilating key employees and managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances  creating and effectively implementing uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information systems  or retaining or recruiting key personnel 
the successful execution of these post acquisition events will involve considerable effort and time  especially considering the highly technical and complex nature of each company s products 
failure to achieve a successful and timely integration of hyperion s and brio s respective businesses could result in the impairment of relationships with employees  customers and business partners as a result of the integration of management and other key personnel and the potential disruption of the combined company s ongoing business and distraction of its management 
the combined company may not succeed in addressing integration issues or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition  which could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of hyperion and its subsidiaries  including brio  and on the price of shares of hyperion common stock 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined company s business 

table of contents charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of shares of hyperion common stock following the acquisition 
in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  the combined company will account for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  which will result in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of shares of hyperion common stock following completion of the acquisition 
under purchase accounting  hyperion will record the market value of its shares issued in connection with the acquisition  the fair market value of the options to purchase brio common stock that will be converted into options to purchase hyperion shares and the amount of direct transaction costs  as the cost of acquiring the business of brio 
the combined company will allocate these total costs to brio s net tangible assets  amortizable intangible assets  intangible assets with indefinite lives and in process research and development based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition  and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
the portion of the estimated purchase price allocated to in process research and development will be expensed by hyperion in the quarter in which the acquisition is completed 
hyperion will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition 
in addition  to the extent the value of these assets  including goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives  becomes impaired  hyperion may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 
these depreciation  amortization  in process research and development and potential impairment charges will decrease the net income of hyperion in the foreseeable future  which could have a material impact on hyperion s results of operations and the market value of shares of hyperion common stock following the acquisition 
the acquisition of brio may not occur or may be significantly delayed the acquisition is subject to review by the united states federal trade commission and the department of justice under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  or the hsr act 
under this statute  hyperion and brio are required to make pre acquisition notification filings and to await the expiration or early termination of statutory waiting periods prior to completing the acquisition 
in addition  the acquisition is subject to law n 
of june   as amended  of brazil  which requires hyperion and brio to make a filing with the brazilian administrative council for economic defense 
hyperion and brio have made these required filings and are seeking to obtain all such required regulatory clearances prior to the scheduled completion of the transaction 
the reviewing authorities may not permit the acquisition at all or may impose restrictions or conditions on the acquisition that may seriously harm hyperion if the acquisition is completed 
these conditions could include a complete or partial license  divestiture  spin off or the holding separate of assets or businesses 
hyperion may refuse to complete the acquisition if restrictions or conditions are required by governmental authorities that would require the divestiture of any assets of hyperion or brio or would limit hyperion s freedom of action with respect to  or its ability to retain  brio or any part of brio or any of hyperion s other assets or businesses 
in addition hyperion must distribute an offering document to brio stockholders  which is subject to review by the securities and exchange commission 
while the sec does not approve the offering document  the review process can involve considerable delay  and could result in a decision by hyperion to abandon the attempt to prepare and circulate the offering document 
also  the brio stockholders must vote to approve the transaction by a majority of the shares outstanding 
there is no assurance that such approval will be obtained 
there are a number of other conditions that must be satisfied in order for the acquisition to be completed 
there can be no assurance that all of these conditions will be met 
delay or prevention of the acquisition would diminish or eliminate the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or result in additional transaction costs  loss of revenue or other effects 
if the acquisition is not completed  hyperion must continue to rely on an oem agreement to access the query and reporting capabilities that brio s products contribute 
continued reliance on an oem source for query and reporting solutions may have an adverse effect on margins 
also  the failure of the acquisition to close could further distract management of hyperion  and have an adverse impact on the continued effort to drive operational efficiencies 
in order to complete the acquisition  even though hyperion and brio are not required to  they may agree to restrictions or conditions imposed by antitrust authorities in order to obtain regulatory approval  and these restrictions or conditions could harm hyperion s operations 
in addition  during or after the statutory waiting periods imposed by the hsr act  and even after completion of the acquisition  governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the acquisition as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest 
in addition  in some jurisdictions  a competitor  customer or other third party could initiate a private action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the acquisition  before or after it is completed 
hyperion  brio or the combined company may not prevail  or may incur significant costs  in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of high quality  liquid securities 
at june   our short term investments consisted of investment grade debt securities with a fair value of million 
the portfolio is invested in securities with relatively short maturities to minimize interest rate risk and for liquidity purposes in the event of immediate cash needs 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
as of june   our long term debt consists of convertible subordinated notes due march with a face value of million 
because our long term debt bears interest at a fixed interest rate  an immediate change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we transact business in various foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from non functional currency denominated trade accounts receivable and intercompany accounts receivable 
intercompany accounts receivable arise when software royalty fees and certain other costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary  which is typically their local currency 
from time to time  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of these trade receivables and certain intercompany receivables for which we anticipate settlement in the foreseeable future 
as a result  increases or decreases in these accounts due to foreign exchange rate changes are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to minimize foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in our consolidated statements of operations 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not material for fiscal  and as of june   we had net forward contracts to sell us dollar equivalent of million in foreign currency 
an immediate change in currency exchange rates affecting these contracts would not have a material impact on our results of operations
