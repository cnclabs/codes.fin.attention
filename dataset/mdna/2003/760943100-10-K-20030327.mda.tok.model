item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we receive revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  educational and support services to populations with special needs 
we have three reportable operating segments i disabilities services  ii youth services and iii training services 
management s discussion and analysis of each segment follows 
further information regarding each of these segments  including the disclosure of required segment financial information  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues for our disabilities services operations are derived primarily from state medicaid programs and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid program 
we also provide respite  therapeutic and other services on an as needed basis or hourly basis through our periodic in home services programs that are reimbursed on a unit of service basis 
reimbursement methods vary by state  and service type  and have historically been based on a flat rate system  cost based reimbursement system  on a per person per diem  or on a unit of service basis 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based upon historical costs experienced by us and by other service providers  or economic conditions and their impact on state budgets 
at facilities and programs where we are the provider of record  we are directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services we provide and such revenues are affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that we operate pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies with respect to medicaid contracts 
in  we began operating programs for at risk and troubled youths through our alternative youth services ays and youthtrack youthtrack subsidiaries 
most of the youth services programs are funded directly by federal  state and local government agencies including school systems 
under these contracts  we are typically reimbursed based on fixed contract amounts  flat rates or cost based rates 
we operate vocational training centers under the federal job corps program administered by the united states department of labor dol 
under job corps contracts  we are reimbursed for direct facility and program costs related to job corps center operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a fixed percentage of facility and program costs 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program costs 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
our contract at the earle c 
clements job corps center in morganfield  kentucky expires on april  and was opened to bid in accordance with job corps rules 
it is expected that the operation will be awarded to another contractor 
annual revenues from the clements center are approximately million 
because of the potential for loss of the contract  we did not include the clements center operations after april  in preparing our operating plan and guidance 
we do not believe the impact of the anticipated loss of the contract will have a material impact on the results of operations  financial condition or capital requirements for on march  we were awarded a new contract to operate the tulsa job corps center in tulsa  oklahoma effective june  revenue is expected to be million annually 
in january  we purchased the assets of the education and training division of arbor  inc arbor e t 
arbor e t operates job training and placement programs that assist disadvantaged job seekers in finding employment and improving their career prospects 
funded through more than performance based or fixed fee contracts from local and state governments  arbor e t employs more than staff  including counselors  trainers  career advisors  and job developers 
based in media  pennsylvania  arbor operates career centers in california  georgia  new jersey  new york  and pennsylvania 
expenses incurred under federal  state and local government agency contracts for disabilities services  job corps and other youth services  as well as management contracts with providers of record for such agencies  are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
our revenues and net income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  in part because annual medicaid rate adjustments may be announced by the various states inconsistently and are usually retroactive to the beginning of the particular state s fiscal reporting period 
we expect that future adjustments in reimbursement rates in most states will consist primarily of cost of living adjustments  adjustments based upon reported historical costs of operations  or other negotiated changes in rates 
however  in some cases states have revised their rate setting methodologies  which has resulted in rate decreases as well as rate increases 
additionally  many states in which we operate are experiencing budgetary pressures and certain of these states have initiated service reductions or rate freezes and or rate reductions 
current initiatives at the federal or 
table of contents state level may materially change the medicaid program as it now exists 
future revenues may be affected by changes in rate setting structures  methodologies or interpretations that may be proposed or are under consideration in states where we operate 
also  some states have considered initiating managed care plans for persons currently in medicaid programs 
at this time  we cannot determine the impact of such changes  or the effect of various federal initiatives that have been proposed 
our facility and program expenses may also fluctuate from period to period  due in large part to changes in labor costs and insurance costs 
labor costs are affected by a number of factors  including the availability of qualified personnel  effective management of our programs  changes in service models and state budgetary pressures 
our insurance costs and self insured retention limits have risen in recent years  due in large part to the insurance market 
we expect our insurance costs to rise approximately in critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicaid programs  other government agencies and commercial insurance companies 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including historical loss rates  age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors  general economic conditions and the status of state budgets 
complex rules and regulations regarding billing and timely filing requirements in various states are also a factor in our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change of estimate 
reserves for insurance risks we self insure a substantial portion of our professional and general liability  workers compensation and health benefit risks 
provisions for losses for these risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates 
the allowances for these risks include an amount determined from reported claims and an amount based on past experiences for losses incurred but not reported 
estimates of workers compensation claims reserves are discounted using an appropriate discount rate at december  
these liabilities are necessarily based on estimates and  while we believe that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the amounts recorded 
the liabilities are reviewed quarterly and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period known 

table of contents legal contingencies we are a party to numerous claims and lawsuits with respect to various matters 
we provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable 
we confer with outside counsel in estimating our potential liability for certain legal contingencies 
while we believe our provision for legal contingencies is adequate  the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict and we may settle legal claims or be subject to judgments for amounts that exceed our estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  loss of contracts  significant census declines  reductions in reimbursement levels and significant litigation 
our evaluation is based on cash flow  profitability and projections that incorporate current or projected operating results  as well as significant events or changes in the environment 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value based upon various techniques to estimate fair value 
we recorded no significant asset valuation losses during  or goodwill and intangible assets we review costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired goodwill  and intangible assets for impairment at least annually  unless changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred sooner 
we are required to test goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
a reporting unit is the operating segment unless  for businesses within that operating segment  discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management  in which case such a component business is the reporting unit 
we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment and recognize an impairment charge for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
fair values are established using comparative market multiples 
as appropriate  discounted cash flows are used to corroborate comparative market multiple results 
revenue recognition disabilities services revenues are derived primarily from state medicaid programs and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid programs 
revenues are recorded at rates established at or prior to the time services are rendered 
training services revenues include amounts reimbursable under cost reimbursement contracts with the dol for operating job corps centers 
the contracts provide reimbursement for all facility and program costs related to job corps center operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a fixed percentage of facility and program costs 
for certain of our current contracts and any contract renewals  the management fee is a combination of fixed and performance based 
final determination of amounts due under the contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol 
youth services juvenile treatment revenues are derived primarily from state awarded contracts from state agencies under various reimbursement systems 
reimbursement from state or locally awarded contracts varies per facility or program  and is typically paid under fixed contract amounts  flat rates  or cost based rates 
laws and regulations governing the government programs and contracts are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
for each operating segment  expenses are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for potential adjustments arising from such examinations

revenues grew in over resulting primarily from the expansion of existing programs 
we expect to add a similar number of new homes in which should result in revenue growth for the year  despite the absence of medicaid rate increases due to state budgetary constraints 
see certain risk factors  below 
operating income increased to million in from million in due primarily to charges that were present in but not in operating income for was positively impacted by a pretax gains of approximately million realized on the extinguishment of debt  an arbitration award of approximately  and a favorable adjustment of  resulting from changing our estimated useful lives of our accounts receivable and time and attendance systems 
operating income for included goodwill amortization of million  a charge of million for workers compensation losses and special charges of million  primarily related to the closure of certain operations  none of which were recorded in as a result of these charges  as well as a charge of million for doubtful accounts receivable  operating income decreased million from general and administrative expenses also increased significantly in over with the implementation of systems and management infrastructure 
our operating results for as compared to reflect continued cost pressures from a competitive labor market in certain regions 
we continued several initiatives to manage these labor cost pressures  including enhanced recruitment and retention programs in order to reduce the need for overtime and temporary staffing  evaluating and monitoring staff patterns and negotiating improved reimbursement rates from certain states 
additionally  we have substantially completed deployment of an automated time and attendance management system which will enable us to more efficiently staff our facilities and monitor staffing  resulting in reduced overtime and temporary staffing 
labor costs as a percentage 
table of contents of revenue increased in compared to as the effect of wage pass throughs and growth in periodic in home services increased that percentage 
as a percentage of total revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses were in  in and in the increase in over and was due primarily to expanding the management infrastructure during  and increased professional services costs and legal expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased significantly in as compared to and as we no longer amortize goodwill 
goodwill amortization was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the increase in compared to is due principally to a full year of interest on the senior notes issued in november the decrease in resulted primarily from lower levels of indebtedness under the previous credit facility during the year and lower interest rates  offset to some extent by indebtedness under the senior notes 
our effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in approximated the statutory rate considering the impact of state taxes and the benefit of jobs credits 
the lower rate in is attributable to a reported loss combined with a fixed level of nondeductible goodwill amortization 
reduced earnings combined with a fixed level of nondeductible goodwill amortization negatively impacted the rate for  offset to an extent by increased jobs tax credits 
in our discussion below of each of the operating segments  we make reference to segment profit before specified items 
we use segment profit before specified items as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally 
this is not a measure defined in gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of segment profit before specified items to segment profit determined in accordance with gaap  as well as a summary of the specified items follows the discussion of results of operations 
disabilities services disabilities services revenues increased by in over compared to a increase in over revenues increased in from the addition of new homes and growth in our periodic in home services 
revenues increased in over due primarily to rate adjustments and the expansion of existing programs  offset by the loss of revenues from the cessation of certain operations in tennessee in early segment profit margin for this division increased from in to in  due primarily to the effect of the workers compensation charge allocated to this division in  offset by income of million related to a bequest from an estate 
this charge was also primarily attributable to the decline in segment profit margin for the division from to before these specified items  segment profit margin was in  in and in the declines were principally due to higher insurance costs in in  the decline was due also to higher labor costs  offset by improved margins on periodic in home services 
youth services youth services revenues decreased by in over and in over  resulting primarily from reduced census at certain youthtrack operations 
segment profit margin for this division increased from in to in  due in part to the workers compensation charge allocated to this division in  as well as the closure of under performing programs during the workers compensation charge was also partially responsible for the decline in segment profit margin for the division from to before these specified items  segment profit margin was in  in and in segment profit margin before specified items declined significantly in from due to census issues throughout the division and labor cost pressures 
improved management and the closure of under performing programs during resulted in increased margins before specified items in compared to during 
table of contents  we experienced a decline in the number of persons served in our youth programs of approximately youths 
this was a result of the closure of certain underperforming programs and reduced placements from certain of the states in which we operate 
we believe the reductions reflect the funding priorities of these states in response to budgetary pressures 
training services training services revenues increased in over and in over segment profit margin for this division remained stable at in compared to in before the specified items discussed above  segment profit margin was in  in and in management uses segment profit before the specified items noted in the table below  among other standards  to measure operating performance 
we have added this information because we believe it assists in understanding our results of operations on a comparative basis 
this supplements  and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with disclosures required by gaap 
a reconciliation of segment profit before the specified items to segment profit as reported under gaap follows

we wrote off the amounts after consideration of the deterioration in various states budgets and the resulting impact on opportunities for collection 
the non core operation charge relates to costs associated with an investigation and closure of certain units of a non core operation which provides skills training to persons with severe mental illness in five texas counties 
the mental health operation is managed by its founders under a management contract and represents less than of the total revenues of the disabilities services division 
the charge includes amounts necessary to close the operations in two of the five counties and for legal fees incurred to respond to the inquiries discussed in the legal proceedings section 
during  we completed transactions to redeem million of the convertible notes resulting in gains on extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional provision for losses on accounts receivable of million as a result of information obtained during the implementation of the new accounts receivable information system 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional provision for insurance claims for workers compensation of million based on studies of its experience 
effective january   we adopted sfas and are no longer amortizing goodwill 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to the write off of assets and costs associated with the cessation of certain operations in tennessee 

table of contents during  we recorded a charge of million related to the write off of costs associated with the terminated management led buyout 
during  we recorded a charge of million related to our restructuring plan implemented in the third quarter of during  we recorded a charge of million related to the settlement of a lawsuit 
financial condition total assets increased in as compared to  with variances occurring in several accounts 
improved collections of accounts receivable contributed to increased cash 
the write off of accounts receivable resulted in a decrease in the net accounts receivable balances and an increase in refundable income taxes due to the tax benefit of these write offs 
goodwill increased from the prior years as a result of acquisitions and other assets decreased due to a combination of cash collections and certain write offs 
long term debt decreased as a result of the redemption of a portion of the convertible subordinated notes 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for and million for the increase in from was due primarily to higher profitability in  a greater increase in accrued expenses than  and less taxes paid in than additionally  accounts receivable before the non cash charge decreased year over year due to improved cash collections contributing to an increase in operating cash flow 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in from was due primarily to a growth in accounts receivable due to revenue growth 
days revenue in net accounts receivable were days at december   compared to days at december  and days at december  net accounts receivable at december  decreased to million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the improvement in over reflects the fourth quarter write off of million recorded in and improved collections 
the decrease in these amounts in over was primarily related to the additional reserve recorded in of the total net accounts receivable balance at december   approximately is greater than days 
during the years ended december   cash used in investing activities was million primarily for purchases of property and equipment  while in and  cash provided by investing activities was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities in resulted primarily from the sale and leaseback of certain of our owned properties with cash proceeds of million 
proceeds from these activities were being used primarily to pay down amounts owed under our previous credit facility 
financing activities for resulted in the use of cash amounting to million  primarily related to the redemption of debt during the year 
financing activities used cash of million in reflecting pay downs of the credit facility from the sale leaseback proceeds and used cash of million in to fund working capital needs 
our capital requirements relate primarily to the working capital needed for general corporate purposes and our plans to expand through the development of new facilities and programs 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments from our operating cash flow and utilization of our credit facility 
cash requirements for the acquisition of new business operations have generally been funded through a combination of these sources  as well as the issuance of long term obligations and common stock 

table of contents on november   we completed an amendment to our million credit facility with national city bank ncb facility 
the amendment revises the calculation of certain financial covenants 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our million credit facility with national city bank ncb facility and outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
as of december   in addition to cash and cash equivalents of million  we had approximately million available under the ncb facility 
the ncb facility expires in september the facility also contains various financial covenants relating to indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions and dividends and requires us to maintain specified ratios with respect to fixed charge coverage  leverage  cash flow from operations and net worth 
additionally  the agreement places limits on the allowable amount of judgments or orders for the payment of money by a court of law 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  our ability to achieve the thresholds provided for in the financial covenants largely depends upon the maintenance of continued profitability and or reductions of amounts borrowed under the facility  and continued cash collections 
we believe sources of funds described above  in addition to cash generated from operations and amounts remaining available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  planned capital expenditure and scheduled debt repayment requirements for the next twelve months 
our convertible notes are due in december we are currently evaluating various sources of funds and strategies to repay these notes 
contractual obligations and commitments information concerning our contractual obligations and commercial commitments follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations twelve months ending december  total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitments expiring per period twelve months ending december  other commercial total amounts commitments committed thereafter standby letters of credit certain risk factors we derive virtually all of our revenues from federal  state and local government agencies  including state medicaid programs 
our revenues therefore are determined by the size of the governmental appropriations for the services we provide 
budgetary pressures  as well as economic  industry  political and other factors  could influence governments not to increase and possibly to decrease appropriations for these services  which could reduce our margins materially 
future federal or state initiatives could institute managed care programs for persons we serve or otherwise make material changes to the medicaid program as it now exists 
federal  state and local government agencies generally condition their contracts with us upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation 
if a government agency does not receive an appropriation sufficient to cover their contractual obligations with us  they may terminate a contract or defer or reduce our reimbursement 
the loss of  or reduction of  reimbursement under our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
this is mitigated by the fact that we operate in states 
for  we anticipate an aggregate rate decrease of for our disabilities services division 
our historical growth in revenues has been directly related to increases in the number of individuals served in each of our operating segments 
this growth has depended largely upon development driven activities  including the acquisitions of other businesses or facilities  the acquisition of management contract rights to operate facilities  the award of contracts to open new facilities or start new operations or to assume management of facilities previously operated by governmental agencies or other organizations  and the extension or renewal of 
table of contents contracts previously awarded to us 
our future revenues will depend primarily upon our ability to maintain  expand and renew existing service contracts and existing leases  and to a lesser extent upon our ability to obtain additional contracts to provide services to the special needs populations we serve  whether through awards in response to requests for proposals for new programs  in connection with facilities being privatized by governmental agencies  or by selected acquisitions 
our job corps contracts are re bid  regardless of operating performance  every five years 
we may not be successful in bidding for contracts to operate  or to continue operating  job corps centers 
changes in the market for services and contracts  including increasing competition  transition costs or costs to implement awarded contracts  could adversely affect the timing and or viability of future development activities 
additionally  many of our contracts are subject to state or federal government procurement rules and procedures  changes in procurement policies that may be adopted by one or more of these agencies could also adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain these contracts 
our revenues and operating profitability depend on our ability to maintain our existing reimbursement levels  to obtain periodic increases in reimbursement rates to meet higher costs and demand for more services  and to receive timely payment from applicable government agencies 
if we do not receive or cannot negotiate increases in reimbursement rates at approximately the same time as our costs of providing services increase  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
changes in how federal and state government agencies operate reimbursement programs can also affect our operating results and financial condition 
government reimbursement  group home credentialing and mr dd client medicaid eligibility and service authorization procedures are often complicated and burdensome  and delays can result due to  among other reasons  documentation securing necessary eligibility paperwork between agencies 
these reimbursement and procedural issues occasionally cause us to have to resubmit claims several times before payment is remitted and are primarily responsible for our aged receivables 
changes in the manner in which state agencies interpret program policies and procedures  and review and audit billings and costs could also affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and our ability to meet obligations under our indebtedness 
our cost structure and ultimate operating profitability are directly related to our labor costs 
labor costs may be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including limited availability of qualified personnel in each geographic area  local competitive forces  the effective utilization of our labor force  changes in minimum wages or other direct personnel costs  strikes or work stoppages by employees represented by labor unions  and changes in client services models  such as the trends toward supported living and managed care 
the difficulty experienced in hiring direct service staff and nursing staff in certain markets from time to time has resulted in higher labor costs in some of our operating units 
these higher labor costs are associated with increased overtime  recruitment and retention  training programs  and use of temporary staffing personnel and outside clinical consultants 
additionally  the maintenance and expansion of our operations depend on the continuation of trends toward downsizing  privatization and consolidation and our ability to tailor our services to meet the specific needs of the populations we serve 
our success in a changing operational environment is subject to a variety of political  economic  social and legal pressures 
such pressures include a desire of governmental agencies to reduce costs and increase levels of services  federal  state and local budgetary constraints  and actions brought by advocacy groups and the courts to change existing service delivery systems 
material changes resulting from these trends and pressures could adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement of our services and our operating flexibility  and ultimately our revenues and profitability 
media coverage of the industry  including operators of facilities and programs for persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities  has from time to time included reports critical of the current trend toward privatization and of the operation of certain of these facilities and programs 
adverse media coverage about providers of these services in general and us  in particular  could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny in some areas  and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability by  among other things  adversely affecting our ability to obtain or retain contracts  discouraging government agencies from privatizing facilities and programs  increasing regulation and resulting compliance costs  or discouraging clients from using our services 

table of contents in recent years  changes in the market for insurance  particularly for professional and general liability coverage  have made it more difficult to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates 
as a result  our insurance program costs for and were higher than in previous years 
our self insured retentions have also increased 
we expect our insurance costs to rise approximately in the professional and general liability coverage provides for a  deductible per occurrence  and claims limits of million per occurrence up to a million annual aggregate limit 
our workers compensation coverage provides for a million deductible per occurrence  and claims up to statutory limits 
we utilize historical data to estimate our reserves for our insurance programs 
if losses on asserted claims exceed the current insurance coverage and accrued reserves  our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to meet obligations under our indebtedness could be adversely affected 
the collection of accounts receivable is a significant management challenge and requires continual focus 
until recently  many of our accounts receivable controls were managed through manual procedures 
we have expended significant effort and resources to implement a new accounts receivable system which was substantially in place at the end of the limitations of some state information systems and procedures  such as the inability to receive documentation or disperse funds electronically  may limit the benefits we derive from our new systems 
we must maintain or improve our controls and procedures for managing our accounts receivable billing and collection activities if we are to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis 
an inability to do so could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
our financial results depend on timely billing of payor agencies  effectively managing collections  and efficiently utilizing our personnel to manage labor costs 
we have substantially completed the new accounts receivable system and an interactive automated time and attendance management system that we believe will improve our management of these functions  improve our collections experience  and reduce our operating expenses 
our financial results and condition may be adversely affected if we do not realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in these new systems 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations and maintain compliance with various financial covenants contained in our debt arrangements will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations and maintain covenant compliance  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
we can provide no assurance that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  maintain covenant compliance or refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
we must comply with comprehensive government regulation of our business  including statutes  regulations and policies governing the licensing of our facilities  the quality of our service  the revenues we receive for our services  and reimbursement for the cost of our services 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we can lose contracts and revenues  thereby harming our financial results 
state and federal regulatory agencies have broad discretionary powers over the administration and enforcement of laws and regulations that govern our operations 
a material violation of a law or regulation could subject us to fines and penalties and in some circumstances could disqualify some or all of the facilities and programs under our control from future participation in medicaid or other government programs 
with the effectiveness of hipaa  the potential penalties could increase 
furthermore  future regulation or legislation affecting our programs may require us to change our operations significantly or incur increased costs 
our success in obtaining new contracts and renewals of our existing contracts depends upon maintaining our reputation as a quality service provider among governmental authorities  advocacy groups for persons with developmental disabilities and their families  and the public 
we 
table of contents also rely on government entities to refer clients to our facilities and programs 
negative publicity  changes in public perception  the actions of consumers under our care or investigations with respect to our industry  operations or policies could increase government scrutiny  increase compliance costs  hinder our ability to obtain or retain contracts  reduce referrals  discourage privatization of facilities and programs  and discourage clients from using our services 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition 
our management of residential  training  educational and support programs for our clients exposes us to potential claims or litigation by our clients or other persons for wrongful death  personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  personnel or other clients 
regulatory agencies may initiate administrative proceedings alleging violations of statutes and regulations arising from our programs and facilities and seeking to impose monetary penalties on us 
we could be required to pay substantial amounts of money in damages or penalties arising from these legal proceedings and some awards of damages or penalties may not be covered by any insurance 
if our third party insurance coverage and self insurance reserves are not adequate to cover these claims  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
expenses incurred under federal  state and local government agency contracts for disabilities services  job corps and other youth services  as well as management contracts with providers of record for such agencies  are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
our revenues and net income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  in part because annual medicaid rate adjustments may be announced by the various states inconsistently and are usually retroactive to the beginning of the particular state s fiscal reporting period 
we expect that future adjustments in reimbursement rates in most states will consist primarily of cost of living adjustments  adjustments based upon reported historical costs of operations  or other negotiated increases 
however  in some cases states have revised their rate setting methodologies  which has resulted in rate decreases as well as rate increases 
future revenues may be affected by changes in rate setting structures  methodologies or interpretations that may be proposed or are under consideration in states where we operate 
also  some states have considered initiating managed care plans for persons currently in medicaid programs 
at this time  we cannot determine the impact of such changes  or the effect of various federal initiatives that have been proposed 
impact of recently issued accounting standards see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements
