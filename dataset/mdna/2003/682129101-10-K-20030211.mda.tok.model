currently  substantially all of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore  the company s liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
significant accounting policies and management judgments the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements as of november   which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  warranty obligations  litigation and environmental reserves  pensions and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements a revenue recognition sales are recognized when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is upon shipment 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for sales returns and rebate programs 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for quantity rebates 
if the actual costs of sales returns and rebate programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
b allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to identify all specific customers that would be considered doubtful based upon the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other relevant factors  or those that have been turned over for collection and to reserve for the portion of those outstanding balances that 
table of contents collection does not appear to be likely 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million at november  c allowance for inventory obsolescence the company s policy is to maintain an inventory obsolescence reserve based upon specifically identified  discontinued or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with usage and sales levels over the last year to two years 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all years presented 
a sudden and unexpected change in design trends and or preferences for patterns  colors and or material could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million at november  d allowance for warranty claims on an on going basis  the company updates its building systems warranty reserve for specifically identified or new matters and a detailed study of the reserve is updated on a semi annual basis to reserve for estimated future costs associated with any open warranty year 
the reserve is a highly sensitive estimate based on historical costs and failure rates 
a change in these factors could result in a significant change in the reserve balance 
the warranty reserve at november  was approximately million 
e litigation and environmental reserves the company reserves for the probable costs associated with any legal claims and environmental remediation projects 
the company s legal department performs on going analyses of legal claims and remediation efforts 
reserves are based upon their analyses and established at the best estimate 
the company s reserves for legal claims and environmental remediation efforts at november  were million and million  respectively 
f pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
sfas no 
and the policies used by the company  notably the use of a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below  generally reduced the volatility of pension income expense from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be percent 
based on the company s existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of percent is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
the plan assets have earned a rate of return substantially less than percent in the last two years 
should this trend continue  future pension income would likely decline 
the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities at its measurement date  august the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings 
table of contents agency 
at august   the company determined this rate to be percent 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas no 
at november   the company s consolidated prepaid pension asset was million compared to million at the end of the increase was principally due to the recognition of pension income 
for the year ended november   the company recognized consolidated pretax pension income of million 
g tax valuation allowance the company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of recovery of such assets 
as of november   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets primarily related to domestic loss carryforwards that expire by  goodwill impairment losses created as a result of the cumulative effect of an accounting change and other temporary differences for which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
the company provided a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets after having considered its recent history of limited income since its spin off from gencorp  projections of future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
environmental matters the company s policy is to conduct its businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment 
the company devotes significant resources and management attention to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of november  reflects reserves for environmental remediation efforts of million 
capital expenditures for projects related to the environment were million in  million in and million in the company currently forecasts that capital expenditures for environmental projects will be approximately million in fiscal during  noncapital expenditures for environmental compliance and protection totaled million  all of which were for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution abatement in ongoing operations 
similar noncapital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
the company anticipates that noncapital environmental expenditures for the next several years will be consistent with historical expenditure levels 
management believes  on the basis of presently available information  that resolution of known environmental matters will not materially affect liquidity  capital resources or the consolidated financial condition of the company 
the effect of resolution of these matters on results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on both future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters 
however  there can be no assurance that future costs and liabilities will not exceed the company s reserves or be material
