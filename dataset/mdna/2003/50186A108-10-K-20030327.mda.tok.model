ls also produces replacement parts for various types of packaging and glass container making machines  which ls does not manufacture 
selected financial information for financial reporting purposes  lynch systems comprises the registrant s glass manufacturing equipment segment 
for information about this segment s net sales  profit or loss  and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years  please see note segment information to the registrant s consolidated financial statements 
lynch systems objectives ls intends to continue to build on its name recognition and reputation as one of the world s leading manufacturers of glass forming machinery 
ls is the only independent supplier in the crt cathode ray tube glass forming field and it is ls s intention to use this strength to form closer partnerships with its customers in their pursuit of innovative glass making machinery 
ls s long term intentions are to monitor the market direction and to be at the forefront of technology in order to respond to market demand for new and innovative types of machinery needed to produce glass 
ls intends to continue to research and develop state of the art machinery within its core competence  and also to seek new markets where its experience and proven success can be utilized to develop new products and increase its growth 
ls also intends to continue to expand on its expertise in the feeder and shear markets obtained from its former joint venture partner  lynch amav llc  and to reduce the cost of its raw materials by continuing to search for cheaper suppliers of materials  especially from foreign markets 
in addition  ls intends to continue its own in house cost cutting programs by eliminating redundant or superfluous operations  improving its factory quality and yield rates and better utilization of its current personnel 
by increasing its efficiency and shortening its delivery rate  ls hopes to increase the number of turns giving a positive effect to its financial performance 
there is no assurance that ls can attain these objectives 
products and manufacturing ls manufactures glass forming presses and electronic controls to provide high speed automated systems to form different sizes of face panels and crt display tubes for television screens and computer monitors including presses to build large screen televisions for the hdtv high definition television market 
ls also manufactures and installs forming equipment that sizes  cuts  and forms tableware such as glass tumblers  plates  cups  saucers and commercial optical glass 
additionally  ls manufactures and installs fire polishing  electronic controls and retrofit systems for crt display and consumer glass presses 
at year end  ls  through a subsidiary  entered into a joint venture  lynch amav llc  with amav gmbh of germany to develop and manufacture glass manufacturing equipment for the tableware industry 
ls had a interest in the joint venture until june  when ls acquired the remaining interests in the joint venture 
the joint venture designed and developed feeders  shears and presses  most of which were manufactured for the joint venture by ls 
ls believes that this joint venture expanded ls s glass tableware equipment business  particularly in europe 
the planned amav technology transfer was completed in and the joint venture was terminated upon final payment of  to the joint venture partner by ls on june  all international business is now directed from bainbridge  georgia and all equipment is produced in the united states 
the production of glassware entails the use of machines  which heat glass and  using great pressure  form an item by pressing it into a desired shape 
because of the high cost of bringing the machine and materials up to temperature  a machine for producing glassware must be capable of running hours a day  days a year 
in ls sold four additional large tv glass press machines that were delivered in these machines sold for an aggregate of million  of which million was recognized as income in using the percentage of completion method with the balance of million recognized in upon delivery and acceptance of these machines 
at december   the company had sold two machines for approximately million  of which million was recognized in using the percentage of completion accounting method with the balance expected to be recognized in upon delivery and acceptance of these machines 
ls s worldwide customers require capital equipment that produces a wide variety of tableware products to remain competitive 
in support of this market demand  lynch systems has invested in research development r d programs to manufacture new lines of capital equipment such as stretch machines for one piece stemware  firepolishers for high quality tableware and spinning machines for high speed  high quality dishware 
to further expand ls s tableware product lines  additional product lines have been acquired through royalty partnerships with leading industry concerns 
in  ls acquired the h press and blow machine from emhart glass sa 
this high production machine produces both round and geometric design tumblers and is now marketed by ls as the lh with numerous electronic control improvements 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  ls is obligated to pay emhart a royalty of on parts sales up to million a year  a royalty rate on all parts sales in excess of million  and on all machine sales through in  the eldred product line of burnoff machines  used to fire finish the rims of the h tumblers  and four color decorating machines were acquired by ls 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  ls is obligated to pay eldred a royalty of on sales up to  per year and royalty on sales over  per year until all tableware capital equipment requires moulds in the production of any article 
in  agreement was reached with merkad glassware mould  ltd  a producer of high quality moulds  to represent and distribute moulds throughout north and south america 
ls has no contractual obligations to merkad 
ls has the capabilities to take a glass product idea from a customer  have our engineering staff design a machine that will mass produce this glass product and then build the final machine for the customer 
ls is in negotiations to obtain other orders for large tv glass presses  however  there can be no assurance that ls will obtain any other orders 
international sales ls s revenues from international sales were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of ls s net sales for  and  respectively 
the profitability of international sales is approximately equivalent to that of domestic sales 
because many international orders require partial advance deposits  with the balance often secured by irrevocable letters of credit from banks in the foreign country  the registrant believes that some of the credit risks commonly associated with doing business in international markets are minimized 
the registrant avoids currency exchange risk by transacting substantially all international sales in united states dollars 
backlog ls had an order backlog of approximately million at december   compared to million at december  backlog declined due to the lack of orders from television and tableware manufactures 
all of ls s million backlog as of december  is scheduled to be delivered in see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events regarding additions to the backlog in early ls includes as backlog only those orders which are subject to written contract or written purchase orders 
in  ls received million in connection with the cancellation of a million order for large tv glass presses and parts  which amount can be used by the customer as a credit for future orders 
the million has been reduced to million as of december  as a result of sales to this customer 
any remaining unused credit will revert to ls at june  competition ls believes that in the worldwide pressware market it is the largest supplier to glass companies that do not manufacture their own pressware machines 
competitors include various companies in italy  japan  korea  germany and elsewhere 
while several of the largest domestic and international producers of glass pressware frequently build their own glass forming machines and produce spare parts in house  nearly all pressware producers have made purchases of machines and or spare parts from ls 
customers although one customer accounted for of lynch systems revenue  its customer mix is diverse and does not believe it is dependent upon a single customer 
raw materials raw materials are generally available to ls in adequate supply from a number of suppliers 
research and development research and development expense  mainly for stretch machines for stemware  was  in   in and zero in r d expense for is budgeted at  intellectual property lynch systems owns patents and proprietary know how which are important to its business and the maintenance of its competitive position 
its most important patent is for a rotary glass molding press with cushioned trunnion mounted hydraulic drive  expiring october  lynch system s investment in lynch amav  discussed above  has given lynch systems access to important proprietary know how and technology which has enabled lynch systems to expand its product offerings and customer base 
employees lynch systems employs employees at its bainbridge  georgia facility  and in germany  none of whom belong to a union

m tron industries  inc m tron overview m tron  a wholly owned subsidiary of lynch  is a designer  manufacturer and marketer of custom designed electronic components that are used primarily to control the frequency or timing of electronic signals in communications equipment 
its devices  which are commonly called frequency control devices  crystals or oscillators  support fixed and mobile wireless  copper wire  coaxial cable  wide area networks  local area networks and fiber optic systems 
it sells its products to original equipment manufacturers  contract manufacturers and to distributors 
m tron s products are quartz crystal based frequency control devices consisting of packaged quartz crystals and oscillators incorporating those crystals 
its products enable communications equipment manufacturers and network equipment manufacturers to meet the increasing demands of their customers because they produce an electrical signal that is accurate the frequency of the signal does not change significantly over a period of time  stable the frequency of the signal does not vary significantly when our product is subjected to a range of operating temperatures  and has low electronic noise the signal does not add interfering signals that can degrade the performance of the electronics system 
in addition  m tron sells crystals and oscillators which are used outside the communications industry 
these frequency control devices are used in microprocessor and computer applications  industrial controls  medical instrumentation  automotive products and military applications 
in october  m tron acquired certain assets  technology and customer orders backlog from champion technologies  inc champion 
champion s product line includes crystals  clock oscillators  specialized crystal oscillators  and timing solutions that will further broaden m tron s product offering and customer base 
see note acquisitions to the registrant s consolidated financial statements 
m tron has over years of experience designing  manufacturing and marketing crystal based frequency control products 
its customers rely on the skills of m tron s engineering and design team to help them solve frequency control problems during all phases of their product s life cycles  including product design  prototyping  manufacturing and subsequent product improvements 
selected financial information for financial reporting purposes  m tron comprises the registrant s frequency control devices segment 
for information about this segment s net sales  profit or loss  and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years  please see note segment information to the registrant s consolidated financial statements 
m tron objectives m tron s objective is to build on the strength of its core expertise in packaged quartz crystal and oscillator technologies to become the supplier of choice to original equipment manufacturers who supply infrastructure equipment to the communications and networking industries 
m tron intends to maintain its current investment in technical resources  including design and engineering personnel to enable it to provide a high level of design and engineering support to its customers 
it believes that technical participation with its original equipment manufacturers customers in the early stages of their design process will lead to m tron s frequency control devices being designed into their products more regularly 
m tron has increased the use of its offshore contract manufacturers who have added capacity on its behalf 
in addition  m tron s long term objective is to reduce the time it takes to manufacture its products which will result in better service to its customers 
to that end  it has dedicated additional resources to evaluating its manufacturing processes and to identifying and implementing process improvements 
m tron believes that it can significantly enhance its business opportunities by acquiring technology  product portfolios and or customer bases 
some of these may offer immediate sales opportunities while others may meet longer term objectives 
it plans to pursue these opportunities by making strategic acquisitions or by acquiring or licensing technology 
m tron intends to design  manufacture and sell devices that offer higher frequencies or greater precision than its current products 
these devices will serve applications within the communications and networking industries for which it does not currently provide products 
it intends to achieve this through a combination of focused research and development and strategic acquisitions  if they are appropriate 
in pursuit of these objectives  m tron completed its initial strategic acquisition by purchasing champion technologies  inc  who will immediately provide both new customers and a wider range of products  including entry to the timing module markets 
there is no assurance that m tron can achieve these objectives 
products m tron s products are high quality  reliable  technically advanced frequency control devices  including packaged quartz crystals and oscillators incorporating those crystals 
the acquisition of certain champion assets will also provide m tron an entry to the timing modules market 
m tron designs and produces a wide range of packaged quartz crystals and quartz crystal based oscillators 
there are a variety of features in its product family 
the packaged crystal is a single crystal in a hermetically sealed package and is used by electronic equipment manufacturers  along with their own electronic circuitry  to build oscillators for frequency control in their electronic devices 
the clock oscillator is the simplest of its oscillators 
it is a self contained package with a crystal and electronic circuitry that is used as a subsystem by electronic equipment manufacturers to provide frequency control for their devices 
the voltage controlled crystal oscillator vcxo is a variable frequency oscillator whose frequency can be changed by varying the control voltage to the oscillator 
the temperature compensated crystal oscillator tcxo is an oscillator designed for use over a range of temperatures 
the digitally compensated crystal oscillator dcxo is a temperature compensated oscillator in which the compensation electronics are digital and offer greater frequency stability than the tcxo over a range of temperatures 
this variety of features in m tron s product family offers the designers at electronic equipment manufacturers a range of options as they create the needed performance in their products 
currently  m tron s oscillator products operate at frequencies ranging from kilohertz to over gigahertz which constitute most of the oscillator frequencies that are now used in communications equipment 
however  many of its products  through amplification or other means  are ultimately incorporated into those products that operate at higher frequencies 
m tron s products are employed in numerous applications within the communications industry  including computer and telephone network switches  high speed gigabit ethernet  modems  wireless transmitters receivers  multiplexers  data recovery regeneration devices  fiber channel networks  repeaters  data transceivers  line interface devices and base station controllers 
its products are incorporated into end products that serve all elements of the communications industry 
the crystals and oscillators m tron sells for use in non communications applications are used in industrial applications such as security systems  metering systems  electronic test instruments and industrial control systems 
they are used in military and medical instrumentation applications as well as in various computer peripheral equipment such as printers  modems  monitors  video cards and sound cards 
these non communications applications may not require the quality and reliability demanded by manufacturers of communications equipment 
a timing module is an electronic subsystem 
it is a pre assembled circuit that integrates several different functions into a small single self contained module for control of timing in a circuit 
today  timing modules are frequently used for the synchronization of timing signals in digital circuits  particularly in wireless and optical carrier network systems 
research and development at december   m tron employed engineers and technicians in south dakota who devoted most of their time to research and development 
its research and development expense was approximately  in   in  and  in m tron expects to reduce its spending on research and development by up to during customers m tron markets and sells its frequency control devices primarily to original equipment manufacturers of communications and networking equipment  contract manufacturers for original equipment manufacturers  and distributors who sell to original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers 
in  one customer accounted for approximately of m tron s net sales  compared to less than in no other customer accounted for more than of its revenues 
sales to its ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales for  and respectively 
international sales m tron s revenues from international sales were million  million  and million for  and  respectively  representing approximately   and of its net sales for  and  respectively 
in  these revenues included approximately from customers in canada  from customers in asia  from customers in western europe and from customers in mexico 
m tron has increased its international sales efforts by adding distributors and manufacturers representatives in western europe and asia 
the champion products acquisition will further improve the company s market position in western europe 
see note acquisitions to the registrant s consolidated financial statements 
backlog m tron had backlog orders of approximately million at december   compared to million at december  the million improvement is mainly the result of manufactured oscillator bookings stemming from the champion acquisition 
m tron includes as backlog those orders which are subject to specific production release orders under written contracts  verbal and written orders from distributors with which it has had long standing relationships  as well as written purchase orders from sales representatives 
its customers may cancel or defer orders without significant penalty 
competition frequency control devices are sold in a highly competitive industry 
there are numerous domestic and international manufacturers who are capable of providing custom designed quartz crystals and oscillator modules comparable in quality and performance to its products 
competitors include vectron international a division of dover corporation  cts corporation and saronix 
m tron does not operate in the same markets as high volume manufacturers of standard products  rather it focuses on manufacturing lower volumes of custom designed frequency control devices 
many of its competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than it does 
m tron seeks to manufacture custom designed  high performance crystals and oscillators  which it believes it can sell competitively based upon performance  quality  order response time and a high level of engineering support 
manufacturing m tron has one manufacturing facility in yankton  south dakota  and has long term relationships with two contract manufacturers in asia  with one contract manufacturer currently enjoying almost all of m tron s business 
m tron maintains a rigorous quality control system and is an iso qualified manufacturer 
in  m tron established a working relationship with a contract manufacturer located in south korea  and in  it established a working relationship with a contract manufacturer located in the people s republic of china 
while it does not have written long term agreements with them  m tron believes that it is potentially their largest customer and  as such  believes that from time to time it received preferential treatment on production scheduling matters 
m tron attempts to utilize standard parts and components that are available from multiple vendors located in the united states or internationally  however  some components used in its products are available from only a limited number of sources 
m tron s manufacturing capacity and capabilities have been enhanced by the manufacturing and test equipment acquired as a result of its purchase of champion technologies  inc intellectual property m tron has no patents  trademarks or licenses which are considered to be important to m tron s business or operations 
rather  m tron believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineering and technical staff in areas of product design and manufacturing processes as well as proprietary know how and information 
employees as of december   m tron employed people 
it has also engaged two independent contractors 
none of its employees is represented by a labor union and it considers its employee relations to be good

spinnaker industries  inc spinnaker until september   lynch through its subsidiary ls owned  shares of the class a common stock and  shares of the common stock of spinnaker industries  inc spinnaker  representing and of the equity and voting power of spinnaker  respectively 
on september   the company sold its remaining interest in spinnaker to an independent  international brokerage firm in new york city 
the transfer was made for nominal consideration because lynch determined that the spinnaker shares had no value as a result of spinnaker s ongoing reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result of this transfer  lynch recorded a  non cash gain and consequently an increase in shareholders equity of  in the third quarter of this action increased lynch s total shareholders equity to  at september  from a deficit of  on june  deconsolidation prior to september   lynch owned and  respectively  of the equity and voting power of spinnaker 
as such  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  lynch consolidated the results of spinnaker and was required to record all of the losses of spinnaker  since the non lynch interests were not required to absorb their shares of losses after their investment was fully absorbed by losses 
on september   lynch caused ls to make a charitable disposition of  shares of spinnaker s class a common stock 
as a result of that transaction a lynch s equity interest and voting power in spinnaker were reduced to and  respectively  b lynch deconsolidated spinnaker for financial reporting purposes  effective september   c from september  until september   lynch accounted for its ownership of spinnaker using the equity method of accounting and d lynch did not record any additional losses from spinnaker  as lynch had no obligation to further fund such losses 
upon the disposition of its remaining spinnaker shares on september  as described above  lynch completed the deconsolidation of spinnaker and no longer has any economic interest in spinnaker or affiliation with spinnaker

the defendants filed a notice of removal  thereby creating united states district court civil action cv no 
the case was remanded to state court 
the spinnaker entities also filed a separate complaint challenging the constitutionality of the maine severance pay act  united states district court civil action no 
which later was dismissed by stipulation of the spinnaker entities 
pace also filed three separate motions for ex parte attachment against the spinnaker entities and lynch 
pace filed the first motion for attachment with its original complaint 
pace sought to attach  an amount large enough to cover the claims of all pace s members seeking severance 
the court denied that motion as being premature 
pace then filed a second motion against the spinnaker entities and lynch for an attachment large enough to cover the claims of eight individual employees seeking severance pay in the amount of 
on august   the court granted that motion in the amount of  on april   pace subsequently recorded this attachment through ucc filings with the maine secretary of state against lynch manufacturing and lynch corporation 
pace filed a third motion for ex parte attachment on august  this motion sought an attachment large enough to cover the severance pay claimed by the remaining pace members   the court denied this motion but permitted pace the opportunity to obtain an attachment after all defendants had an opportunity to respond and after hearing 
before any further action was taken with respect to pace s third motion for attachment  the spinnaker defendants filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code

qui tam lawsuit lynch corporation  lynch interactive corporation interactive  and several other parties have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought under the so called qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act in the united states district court for the district of columbia 
the complaint was filed under seal with the court on february   and the seal was lifted on january  the company was formally served with the complaint on july  the main allegation in the case is that the defendants participated in the creation of sham bidding entities that allegedly defrauded the federal treasury by improperly participating in federal communications commission spectrum auctions restricted to small businesses  as well as obtaining bidding credits in other spectrum auctions allocated to small and very small businesses 
the lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of damages  which would be subject to mandatory trebling under the statute 
on september   interactive  on behalf of itself and lynch  filed two motions with the court a motion to transfer the action to the southern district of new york and a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 
the relator filed an opposition reply to interactive s motion to dismiss and  on december   interactive filed a reply in support of its motion to dismiss 
as of the date of filing of this report  no hearing had been scheduled on interactive s motions 
the us department of justice has notified the court that it has declined to intervene in the case 
the defendants strongly believe that the lawsuit is completely without merit and intend to defend the suit vigorously 
furthermore  under the separation agreement between the company and interactive pursuant to which interactive was spun off to the company s shareholders on september   interactive would be obligated to indemnify the company for any losses or damages incurred by the company as a result of this lawsuit  and interactive has  in fact  agreed in writing to defend the case on lynch s behalf and to indemnify lynch for any losses it may incur as a result of the lawsuit 
interactive has retained legal counsel to defend the claim on behalf of lynch and interactive at the expense of interactive

compliance with listing standards on december  american stock exchange amex or the exchange advised lynch that it was initiating an informal review of lynch s eligibility for continued listing on amex because  based upon amex s review of lynch s form q for the period ended september  lynch had shareholders equity of less than million and losses from continuing operations in two of its three most recent fiscal years and lynch had shareholders equity of less than million and losses in three out of its four most recent fiscal years 
amex requested lynch to provide the exchange with lynch s specific plan for achieving compliance with the exchange s continued listing guidelines 
on january   lynch responded to the amex  explaining that lynch s failure to meet the continued listing guidelines was attributable to the fact that  until september   by virtue of its control position in spinnaker  lynch was required to consolidate of spinnaker s losses and that  in the absence of these losses from spinnaker  lynch would have reported positive equity and positive net income for the nine month period ending september  lynch further explained that its new management team had taken steps to deconsolidate spinnaker from lynch for financial reporting purposes effective from and after september  by reducing lynch s equity and voting interests in spinnaker below 
see item business c 
spinnaker industries  inc deconsolidation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  percentage of completion of long term contracts  and the provision for income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable accounts receivable on a consolidated basis consist principally of amounts due from both domestic and foreign customers 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and collateral is not generally required except at lynch systems 
the company considers concentrations of credit risk to be minimal due to the company s diverse customer base 
in relation to export sales  the company requires letters of credit supporting a significant portion of the sales price prior to production to limit exposure to credit risk 
certain subsidiaries and business segments have credit sales to industries that are subject to cyclical economic changes 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts at a level that management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and relationship of our accounts receivable and revenues 
in determining these estimates  we examine historical write offs of our receivables and review each client s account to identify any specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to estimate accurately the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
inventories valued using the last in  first out lifo method comprised approximately and of consolidated inventories at december  and  respectively 
the balance of inventories at december  and are valued using the first in first out fifo method 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by management  adjustments may be required 
revenue recognition and accounting for long term contracts revenues  with the exception of certain long term contracts discussed below  are recognized upon shipment when title passes 
shipping costs are included in manufacturing cost of sales 
lynch systems  a owned subsidiary of the company  is engaged in the manufacture and marketing of glass forming machines and specialized manufacturing machines 
certain sales contracts require an advance payment usually of the contract price which is accounted for as a customer advance 
the contractual sales prices are paid either i as the manufacturing process reaches specified levels of completion or ii based on the shipment date 
guarantees by letter of credit from a qualifying financial institution are required for most sales contracts 
because of the specialized nature of these machines and the period of time needed to complete production and shipping  lynch systems accounts for these contracts using the percentage of completion accounting method as costs are incurred compared to total estimated project costs cost to cost basis 
at december  and  unbilled accounts receivable included in accounts receivable were million and million  respectively 
the percentage of completion method is used since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
financial management maintains contact with project managers to discuss the status of the projects and  for fixed price engagements  financial management is updated on the budgeted costs and required resources to complete the project 
these budgets are then used to calculate revenue recognition and to estimate the anticipated income or loss on the project 
in the past  we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which have resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those contracts 
we may experience similar situations in the future 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probably and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
warranty expense lynch systems provides a full warranty to world wide customers who acquire machines 
the warranty covers both parts and labor and normally covers a period of one year or thirteen months 
based upon experience  the warranty accrual is based upon three to five percent of the selling price of the machine 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of the reserve and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
balance  beginning of the period warranties issued during the period settlements made during the period changes in liabilities for pre existing warranties during the period  including expirations balance  end of the period income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets whose realization is not likely 
as of december  and december   a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  was recorded 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  an adjustment may be required to the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation adjustment quarterly 
earnings per share and stock based compensation the company s basic and diluted earnings per share are equivalent as the company has no dilutive securities

under sfas  an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
severance pay would be recognized over time rather than up front if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period 
the liability for severance pay would be recognized as employees render service over the future service period  even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service

results of operations year compared to including results of spinnaker for the nine months ended september  effective september   the company s ownership and voting interest of spinnaker industries  inc was reduced to and respectively  due to the disposition of shares of spinnaker 
as a result  effective september   the company relinquished control of spinnaker and has deconsolidated spinnaker 
on september   lynch disposed of its remaining interest in spinnaker 
see note to the consolidated financial statements basis of presentation 
accordingly  spinnaker results of operations have only been included for nine months in net sales consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  a reduction of million from fiscal year  due mainly to the previously described deconsolidation of spinnaker 
spinnaker s net sales for the nine month period ending september  of million accounted for of the year over year unfavorable revenue variance 
lynch systems revenues declined by million  or  to million due to low order in flow 
in spite of a substantial increase in quotations  producers of television and computer monitor screens and other devices that incorporate electronic display did not order glass press machines 
sales of glass press machines and their related spare parts of million were million less than in addition  tableware machine sales of million were million less than last year  reflecting world wide weaknesses in the glass industry 
the remaining reduction of million was related to various businesses and due to general weakness in the economy 
due to these industry weaknesses  lynch systems backlog declined by million from december  to million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events relating to increases in the backlog in early m tron s served market  the infrastructure segment of the telecommunications industry  continued to be deeply depressed by the major correction of world wide overcapacity caused by the internet bubble 
m tron could not overcome the dramatic reduction in spending by its customers who use m tron s quartz crystals and oscillators in their communication and networking equipment 
as a result  m tron suffered a sales decline of million  or  from in to million in partly as a result of the company s acquisition of champion technologies  inc  described in note to the consolidated financial statements  m tron s december  backlog improved by million to million from the prior year end backlog of million 
operating profit consolidated operating profit was million in  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal operating profit includes a million gain on deconsolidation of spinnaker  while results included an operating loss of million at spinnaker  which included an asset impairment and restructuring charge of million  and a million gain on deconsolidation see note to the consolidated financial statements basis of presentation 
m tron s operating loss of million was equivalent to the loss of million despite a reduction in sales 
personnel reductions throughout personnel at december  versus personnel at december   and salary rate reductions helped to control costs 
lynch systems operating profit of million was less than by million due to million  or  less revenue that included the loss of higher margin repair parts business 
to help offset the decline in revenue  headcount at lynch systems was reduced to at december  from at december  other income expense investment income of  at december  represented a reduction of  from the previous year  of which  was attributable to spinnaker 
low interest rates on invested funds was also a factor in reducing investment income 
interest expense of  was million less than the prior year  primarily due to spinnaker  which represented million of s interest expense 
other expense of  was mainly the result of a  loss on disposing certain fixed assets at lynch systems  offset by foreign exchange gains and fees received from champion s lending bank for collecting accounts receivable on its behalf 
income tax benefit expense includes federal  state and local taxes 
because the gain on deconsolidation in the amount of million is non taxable  the company incurred a taxable loss of million 
as a result  the company recorded a tax benefit of million which includes a million tax benefit as a result of a capital loss carry back on the company s investment in spinnaker industries 
this investment was disposed of on september  in spite of a net loss for the year  there was a  tax expense as spinnaker s loss did not provide any tax benefits to lynch 
there was no minority interest income or losses in however  minority interests reduced fiscal losses by million as a result of losses at spinnaker that were allocable to the minority interests to the extent of their investment in spinnaker 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share  which compared to a net loss of million or per share for the same period of net income of million was due primarily to the million gain on the final deconsolidation of spinnaker industries

see note to the consolidated financial statements basis of presentation 
total backlog of manufactured products at december  was million  which represents a decrease of million from the comparable backlog of million at december  not included in this backlog is million and million at december  and respectively  representing a payment from a customer for a glass press order at lynch systems which was subsequently cancelled 
the customer can use this amount for future orders and  if not utilized  will be forfeited to lynch systems in the backlog at lynch systems declined sharply from million to million due to depressed demand from the crt and tableware industries see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events

m tron s served market  the infrastructure segment of the telecommunications industry  was deeply depressed by the major correction of overcapacity caused by the internet bubble 
m tron could not overcome the dramatic reduction in spending by its customers and suffered a sales decline from million in to million in operating loss operating loss for was million compared to an operating loss of million in spinnaker s nine month operating loss was million compared to an operating loss of million in spinnaker s operating results primarily reflect lower operating margins due to lower selling prices attributable to excess capacity and a weak general economy 
spinnaker recognized restructuring charges affiliated with its coating business  during the first nine months of of million compared to million in the restructuring charge was for the closing of the spinnaker coating facility in westbrook  maine 
non cash asset impairment charges of million goodwill million  fixed assets million accounted for the majority of the million restructuring cost

subsequent to the company s deconsolidation of spinnaker  spinnaker filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in november  m tron s operating profit declined by million from a profit of million to a loss of million 
in spite of a percent reduction in headcount and a further curtailment in hours worked  m tron could not compensate for the percent reduction in sales and lower selling prices 
m tron s and profits were also impacted by ipo rights offering costs of  and  respectively 
m tron s earnings were also reduced by a product issue with a long time contract manufacturer 
m tron provided reserves for this product issue totaling  at december  in addition  m tron wrote down its inventories by  due to the sudden drop in demand that started in march  lynch systems operating profit increased by million to million due to increased order volume and cost controls that enabled lynch systems to improve its return on sales by percentage points 
other income expense investment income decreased by million all attributable to spinnaker caused by lower investment earnings rates  the month versus month comparison  and less cash invested 
interest expense of million was million less than the prior year primarily due to reduced debt at lynch systems  the month versus month comparison at spinnaker  and lower borrowing rates 
income tax benefit expense includes federal  state and local taxes 
in spite of a net loss for the year  there was a  tax expense as spinnaker s loss does not provide any tax benefits to lynch 
factors resulting in this tax  and factors that reduced the year effective tax rate to include provisions for contingencies  state income taxes  goodwill amortization  a valuation allowance for deferred taxes  and our foreign sales corporation 
minority interests  reduced losses by million as a result of losses at spinnaker that were allocable to the minority interests to the extent of their investment in spinnaker  and profits of million for the minority interest in lynch amav 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  which compares to the net loss of million  or per share  for the same period of  and was due primarily to spinnaker s month loss of million that was partly offset by the million gain on deconsolidation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements basis of presentation 
total backlog of manufactured products at december  excluding spinnaker was million  which represents a decrease of million from the comparable backlog of million at december  not included in this backlog is million and million at december  and respectively  representing a payment from a customer for a glass press order at lynch systems which was subsequently cancelled 
the customer can use this amount for future orders and  if not utilized  will be forfeited to lynch systems 
the backlog at lynch systems declined slightly from million to million 
meanwhile  the backlog at m tron decreased to million from million due to the dramatic reduction in buying by oem suppliers to the telecommunications sector which started in march  liquidity and capital resources the discussion below excludes the impact of spinnaker  which was deconsolidated at september  and disposed of in september as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements basis of presentation 
thus  the discussion below reflects liquidity and capital resource matters for the company s remaining consolidated subsidiaries at december  and december  at december   the company had current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
working capital was therefore million as compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   as compared to to ratio at december   an improvement of to 
customer advances current liability declined million  essentially offsetting the million reduction in trade receivables current assets 
cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in compared to cash provided of approximately million in  primarily resulting from operating losses 
capital expenditures  on a comparable basis  were million in and million in the company anticipates that it will have sufficient cash flow from operations and borrowing availability under various credit facilities at the subsidiaries to fund near term capital expenditures 
at december   total debt of million was million more than total debt at december  of million 
the increase in debt is primarily due to a million increase in m tron s revolving credit loan that was used to finance operating losses and purchase certain champion technology  inc assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements acquisitions 
debt outstanding at december  included million of fixed rate debt at an interest rate  and million of variable rate debt year end average rate of 
on may   lynch systems entered into an agreement with a bank for a million line of credit to be used for the issuance of standby letters of credit and or up to million revolving credit 
this line of credit is secured by accounts receivable and inventories 
amounts available under this line of credit will be used to fund letters of credit securing customer advances  certain warranty coverages and working capital 
on august   m tron entered into an amended credit agreement with its bank to set its revolving loan credit line at million 
restrictions on dividends under the m tron loan with first national bank of omaha disallow distributions to the parent company without consent of the bank 
lynch systems  under its loan with sun trust bank  may pay a cash dividend to the parent company equal to of ls s net income for the prior fiscal year 
under the m tron loan agreement  advances to the parent company are disallowed without the prior written consent of the lending bank 
under its loan agreement  ls may pay an annual management fee to the parent company in an amount not to exceed  in addition  ls may reimburse the parent company for expenses and taxes paid by the parent on behalf of ls 
the m tron revolving credit agreement matures on april  the company and m tron are currently in negotiations with first national bank of omaha to renew the line of credit 
at december   the company s total cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities total million including million of restricted cash 
in addition  the company had a consolidated total million borrowing capacity under ls s revolving line of credit 
therefore  gross cash and securities and availability under the lynch systems loan total million and exceed the outstanding debt of million by million 
in the near term  the company expects to receive a million cash tax benefit through carry backs for prior periods operating losses 
the company presently does not guarantee m tron s bank debt 
the parent company has provided an unsecured guarantee of lynch systems debt to sun trust bank 
funding for the champion transaction was provided by the south dakota board of economic development funded on january   yankton area progressive growth  inc and the areawide business council in the amount of   and  respectively 
these loans  which total  are secured by m tron s real estate and have maturity dates of december   april   and november  respectively 
principal payments under three loans will total  in the average interest rate in for these fixed rate loans will be 
see note to the consolidated financial statements notes payable to bank and long term debt 
the board of directors has adopted a policy of not paying cash dividends  a policy which is reviewed annually 
this policy takes into account the long term growth objectives of the company  especially its acquisition program  shareholders desire for capital appreciation of their holdings and the current tax law disincentives for corporate dividend distributions 
accordingly  no cash dividends have been paid since january  and none are expected to be paid in see note to the consolidated financial statements notes payable to banks and long term debts for restrictions on the companies assets 
details of the company s contractual obligations for long term debt and losses are as follows see notes and to the consolidated financial statements payments due by period total revolving credit loan long term debt operating leases total market risk the company is exposed to market risk relating to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the amounts of interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments approximately million at december  
the company generally finances the debt portion of the acquisition of long term assets with fixed rate  long term debt 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk in the near future  although the strategies may be reevaluated as market conditions dictate 
there has been no significant change in market risk since december  since the company s international sales are in us dollars  there is no monetary risk 
at december   approximately million of the company s debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and cash flows are slightly affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings for variable rate debt  and assuming a two percentage point increase in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense would change by less than million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash  investments  and trade accounts receivable 
the company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short term investments with various financial institutions 
these financial institutions are located throughout the country and the company s policy is designed to limit exposure to any one institution 
the company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions that are considered in the company s investment strategy 
other than certain accounts receivable  the company does not require collateral on these financial instruments 
in relation to export sales  the company requires letters of credit supporting a significant portion of the sales price prior to production to limit exposure to credit risk 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts at a level that management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses 
risk factors certain subsidiaries and business segments of the company sell to industries that are subject to cyclical economic changes 
any downturns in the economic environment would have a financial impact on the company and its consolidated subsidiaries and may cause the reported financial information herein not to be indicative of future operating results  financial condition or cash flows 
future activities and operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuating demand for capital goods such as large glass presses  delay in the recovery of demand for components used by telecommunications infrastructure manufacturers  disruption of foreign economies and the inability to renew or obtain new financing for expiring loans
