item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of breakthrough medicines that regulate cell signaling with small molecules 
breakthrough medicines are products  created de novo  that may be used to treat diseases in innovative ways 
we are developing a comprehensive approach to the treatment of cancer and are primarily focused on a series of product candidates for targeted oncology indications 
we have an exclusive license to pioneering technology and patents related to the discovery  development  and use of drugs that regulate nf kb cell signaling activity  which has been implicated in many major diseases 
general since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products  and most of our revenue to date has been received in connection with our past relationship with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis 
except for the gain on the sale of our fifty percent interest in the hoechst ariad genomics center llc the genomics center to aventis in december  which resulted in net income for fiscal  we have not been profitable since inception 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  clinical trials  and product manufacturing 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our business strategy aims to balance near term revenues from product partnering and technology licensing with independent product development and commercialization 
with respect to the development and commercialization of our lead product candidates  our goals are to enter into a partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate  ap  to treat cancer  enter into partnerships with medical device companies to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate  ap  in drug delivery stents to decrease reblockage of arteries following angioplasty and stenting  independently develop as many of our product candidates as possible through at least phase before partnering them  establish the commercial infrastructure to market or co market our anti cancer product candidates in the united states  and enter into partnerships for our other product candidates outside the united states 
with respect to our core technologies and intellectual property  our goals are to license our nf kb technology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies conducting research on the discovery of 
table of contents drugs that modulate nf kb cell signaling and or marketing such drugs and to license our regtech cell signaling technologies to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to accelerate their drug discovery 
in addition  we may jointly develop product candidates incorporating our argent cell signaling regulation technology  especially with companies that have proprietary therapeutic genes  cellular systems or gene delivery vectors 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our strategies and generating future revenue streams 
critical accounting policies our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of stock based compensation to consultants  deferred compensation benefits for executives and key employees  and the carrying value of intangible assets 
in determining expense related to stock based compensation and deferred compensation  recorded balances are adjusted at each reporting period to reflect fair value utilizing the black scholes financial model that takes into account  among other things  the price and volatility of our common stock or other underlying securities  an interest free discount rate  and an estimate of the life of the option contract 
fluctuations in those factors result in uneven expense charges or credits to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the price and volatility of our common stock were greater as of december   we would have recognized an increase of  in stock based compensation to consultants in similarly  if the market price of the underlying securities in our executive deferred compensation plan was higher at december   we would have recognized an additional  in compensation expense in at december   we reported million of intangible assets consisting of costs related primarily to purchased patents  patent applications and licenses 
these costs are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying patents or licenses 
changes in these lives or a decision to discontinue using the technologies could result in material changes to our balance sheet and statements of operations 
for example  during  we expensed  of unamortized costs related to certain intangible assets which we are not actively developing any longer 
we recently announced that we are focusing our resources primarily on developing our three lead anti cancer  small molecule product candidates and have extended our development timelines on several other programs 
we have concluded that the carrying value of our intangible assets is not currently impaired because they are utilized in our anti cancer programs and or continue to be viable technologies for collaborations or licensing efforts which we continue to pursue 
if we were to abandon the underlying technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recognized research revenue of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in research revenue was due to license agreements into which we have entered related to our nf kb and argent cell signaling technologies 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this million increase in expenses as compared to those incurred in was primarily due to the costs of advancing our product candidates through preclinical and clinical phases of development 
as of december   we had seven development candidates of which one was in phase development 
preclinical costs include product development costs including pharmacology and toxicology studies and manufacturing costs to produce and scale up material for various studies and clinical trials 
our increase in development activity 
table of contents resulted in a higher level of spending on product development of million  product manufacturing and external activities in support of clinical development of  and increased personnel expenses of  in addition  we wrote off  of capitalized patent and license costs reflecting our evaluation of several technologies in our portfolio which we are not actively developing at this time 
such increases in costs were partially offset by decreased overhead expenses of  and decreased consulting costs of  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this million increase in expenses as compared to those incurred in was primarily due to increased professional expenses of  resulting principally from our litigation with eli lilly and company regarding infringement of certain claims of one of our patents  personnel expenses of  resulting from additions to our legal and business development personnel and other general expenses of in march  we announced that we are focusing our research and development efforts primarily on our anti cancer small molecule product candidates and reducing or deferring our research and development efforts in certain other programs 
as a result of this decision  we have reduced our workforce by and expect to reduce our overall expenses by approximately from those amounts incurred in actual expenses will be determined in part by our ability to realize revenue through partnerships  licensing  joint ventures or similar arrangements  progress in the development and testing of our product candidates  progress and status of our litigation with eli lilly and company  and our ability to raise additional funding through the sale of equity securities 
interest income expense interest income decreased to  in from million in primarily as a result of declining interest rates during the year and a lower level of funds invested 
interest expense increased to  in from  in this increase was primarily due to a higher level of long term debt outstanding in offset  in part  by lower interest rates for other income tax refund other income for the year ended december  consisted of a one time tax refund of  received in june  due to changes in the tax laws 
as a result of these changes  we were able to carry back a portion of the loss to offset the taxes resulting from the sale of our interest in the genomics center to aventis 
in december  we recognized a gain on the sale of million  net of  in alternative minimum tax  and reported the gain in other income 
operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million or 
we expect that our loss from operations will decrease in due to focusing our research and development efforts primarily on our three anti cancer small molecule product candidates 
losses may fluctuate depending on the extent to which  if at all  we enter into collaborations or partnerships for one or more of our product candidates or licenses for our technologies 
the extent of operating losses will also depend on our ability to raise funding from other sources  such as the capital markets  which will influence the amount we will spend on research and development and the development timelines for our product candidates 
we reported a net loss of million in or 
per share basic and diluted

table of contents years ended december  and revenue we recognized research revenue of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in research revenue was due to the termination of our services agreements with the genomics center as a result of the sale of our ownership interest in the genomics center to aventis on december  research revenue for the year ended december  was comprised principally of transitional research revenue for services provided to aventis following the december  sale of our interest in the genomics center 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this million increase in expenses as compared to those incurred in was primarily due to advancing our lead product candidates further through development resulting in a higher level of spending on product development of  product manufacturing and external activities in support of clinical trials of million  costs associated with the launch of our initiatives to promote the commercialization and licensing of our cell signaling regulation technologies by both corporate and academic researchers of  increased personnel expenses of  and overhead expenses of  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this million increase in expenses as compared to those incurred in was primarily due to increased professional expenses of  resulting from increased use of certain consultants  and personnel expenses of  interest income expense interest income decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of declining interest rates during the year

table of contents selected quarterly financial data summarized quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts quarters first second third fourth total research revenue net loss net loss per share basic and diluted quarters first second third fourth total research revenue net loss net loss per share basic and diluted liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments primarily through private placements and public offerings of our equity securities and research revenue and other transactions resulting from our collaboration with aventis from to  including the sale of our interest in the genomics center in december in addition  we have financed our operations through the issuance of long term debt  operating and capital lease transactions  certain licensing transactions  interest income  and government sponsored research grants 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and working capital of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million at december  the primary uses of cash during the year ended december  were million to finance our operations and working capital requirements  million to repay long term debt  million to invest in intellectual property and  to purchase equipment 
we expect that our working capital requirements for will be reduced from as a result of focusing our research and development efforts on our three lead anti cancer small molecule product candidates 
the primary sources of funds during the year ended december   were million from the sale of common stock   from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan   from the sales and maturities of marketable securities and  from additional borrowing to finance purchases of equipment 
on june   we filed a shelf registration statement with the united states securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance of up to million registered shares of our common stock  which was declared effective by the sec on august  the shelf registration statement 
at december   we had  registered shares remaining available for sale at our discretion under this shelf registration  following the sale of  shares of common stock on october  on november   we sold an additional  shares of our common stock registered under such shelf registration statement to existing and new institutional investors at a price of per share and received gross proceeds of million before commissions and expenses of  this net amount of million was included in the primary sources of funds mentioned in the preceding paragraph 
on january   we filed an additional shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of up to million registered shares of our common stock  
table of contents which was declared effective on february  the million registered shares  as well as the  shares remaining on the shelf registration statement  remain available for sale at our discretion  subject to certain limitations under federal securities laws and the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt instruments 
these contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payments due by period through through after contractual obligations total in long term debt operating leases other long term obligations total fixed contractual obligations other long term obligations are comprised primarily of employment agreements and license agreements 
the license agreements generally provide for payment by us of annual license fees  milestone payments and royalties upon successful commercialization of products 
all license agreements are cancelable by us 
the above table reflects remaining license fees for the lives of the agreements but excludes milestone and royalty payments  as such amounts are not probable or estimable at this time 
in march  we entered into a term loan agreement with a bank for million  the proceeds of which were used to repay existing long term debt  to pay off our obligations under certain operating leases for equipment and for general working capital purposes 
the term loan is payable in monthly installments of  beginning in april plus interest with a final payment due in march of million 
had this term loan been effective on december   our total fixed contractual obligations in the table above would have been million in  million in the period through   in the period through and  thereafter 
we will require substantial additional funding for our research and development programs for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether obtained through financial markets or other arrangements with collaborative partners  or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
based on our current operating plans and assuming no further funding or potential revenues that may be generated from product partnering or licensing initiatives we are currently pursuing  we believe that our current available funds will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operating requirements into the second quarter of however  there can be no assurance that changes in our research and development plans or other future events affecting our revenues or operating expenses will not result in the earlier depletion of our funds 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard  requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
in april  the eitf issued eitf  accounting for options granted to employees in unrestricted  publicly traded shares of an unrelated entity 
this consensus requires that companies account for such benefits as derivatives under sfas no 
we adopted the provisions of these pronouncements in connection with our executive compensation plan in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the eitf issued eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this consensus provides guidance in determining when a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units 
the provisions of eitf are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we will evaluate multiple element arrangements in accordance with this eitf conclusion upon its effective date for new arrangements into which it enters 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have determined that we will continue to account for stock based compensation to employees under the provisions of apb no 
and will make all required disclosures in our annual and interim financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement replaces eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and requires that a liability for costs associated with a disposal or exit activity be recognized only when an actual liability is incurred and not when management has committed to a plan as is the case under eitf the application of this statement is required for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  
table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements first in short term  highly liquid securities  with maturities of days or less  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government securities with maturities of one year or less  but generally less than six months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains and losses on marketable security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe  however  that the effect  if any  of reasonable possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows generally would not be material due to the short term nature of these investments 
in particular  at december   because our available funds are invested solely in cash equivalents and short term securities with maturities less than days  our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
we have an executive compensation plan which provides participants  in lieu of a cash bonus  an option to purchase certain designated mutual funds at a discount equal to the amount of the bonus 
these deferred compensation arrangements are accounted for as derivatives under sfas no 
the fair value of the derivatives are reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
as of december   in the event of a hypothetical increase decrease in the fair market value of the underlying mutual funds  we would incur approximately  of additional less compensation expense 
at december   we have a bank term note which bears interest at prime plus 
this note is sensitive to interest rate risk 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the prime rate basis points  we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year 
our refinancing in march would not affect this sensitivity analysis materially
