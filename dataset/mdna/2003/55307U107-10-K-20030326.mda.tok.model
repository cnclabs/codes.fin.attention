item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
on may   the partnership completed the purchase of the macadamia farming operations from four subsidiaries of c 
brewer and company  ltd 
the acquired assets consisted of acres of macadamia orchards  farming contracts  farming equipment  vehicles  a husking plant  irrigation well  office buildings  garages and warehouses  office furniture and equipment and material inventories related to macadamia farming 
all the assets and operations are located on the island of hawaii 
effective with the acquisition  the partnership began performing all the farming operations for its own  acres and for approximately  additional acres owned by other growers 
results of operations   owned orchard segment production and yields production and yield data for the eight orchards are summarized below expressed in wet in shell pounds at moisture average yield per acre orchard acquired acreage production keaau i june keaau ii oct

totals except yields which are averages production for the orchards purchased in and is net of unusable nuts  as stated in their respective nut purchase agreements 
production for the orchards purchased in and includes all nuts delivered 
the nut purchase contracts for the and orchards require the purchaser  mauna loa macadamia nut corporation mauna loa  to purchase all of the nuts delivered from these orchards 
the partnership reports on a calendar year basis  though the natural crop year generally begins in august and runs through april 
production in was lower than and higher than production in was higher than  but lower than the record harvest in significant factors affecting the crop were as follows the drought in the ka u orchards from june through december negated the increase in nut set which had resulted from the rainfall during the first five months of the year 
the above average rainfall in the keaau and mauna kea orchards negatively impacted the pollination and nut set for the fall harvest the ka u region was affected by a rainstorm and flood in november of that resulted in a net loss of approximately  wis pounds 
rainfall from the storm replenished the soil moisture and improved the yields in this region for production in the ka u region in was hindered by a third consecutive year of drought before the november rainstorm 
rainfall through october was only inches compared to the region s ten year average of inches of rain 
modest improvements in rainfall occurred throughout the record crop in was mainly the result of an exceptionally strong spring crop from the crop year and a heavy fall harvest from the crop in all regions 
the ka u green shoe i orchard and the mauna kea orchard are not yet fully mature 
as a result  the yields from these orchards are expected to be lower on average over the next few years than for the partnership s mature orchards 
at full maturity under favorable growing conditions  a macadamia orchard can produce between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at ka u and between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at keaau 
no trees have reached full maturity in the mauna kea area  but it is expected that production at maturity at the mauna kea orchard will approximate keaau levels 
owned orchard segment nut revenue macadamia nut revenues depend on the number of producing acres  yields per acre and the nut purchase price 
the impact of these factors is summarized in the following table over over trees acres harvested average yield wis lbs 
acre nuts harvested s wis lbs 
nut price wis lbs 
gross nut sales s litigation adjustment nut price settlement recorded nut sales s under four of the nut purchase contracts with mauna loa  the price for nuts delivered is based on the two year trailing average of usda published macadamia nut prices and on a netback component 
the netback component is determined by subtracting from mauna loa s gross revenues from the sale of macadamia products i allocable processing  packaging  marketing  selling and advertising costs and ii a capital charge on the difference between those aggregate gross revenues and aggregate allocable costs 
the following table sets forth the manner in which the nut purchase price per pound was determined for  and lb 
usda price two years prior a usda price one year prior a usda price two year trailing average gross revenues less allocable processing  packaging  marketing  sales and advertising costs less capital charge net back component usda price two year trailing average net back component average of usda two year trailing average price and net back component plus hawaii general excise tax net purchase price b c d e a mauna loa s own purchases comprise a substantial portion of nut purchases reported to the usda 
therefore  the usda price component of the purchase price is  to a substantial degree  the average price that mauna loa has paid to purchase macadamia nuts from the partnership and from third parties during the previous two years 
b the nut purchase price for the and orchards was the same for and all previous years 
with the change of ownership of mauna loa in  a quality conversion factor in the nut purchase contracts was initiated 
the effect was to cause a slightly different price of for the orchards in  in and in c the nut purchase contract covering nut production from the acre keaau lot orchard acquired in september defines the two year trailing average provision slightly differently from the and nut purchase contracts  and thus  results in a different nut price 
the nut price for this orchard was in  in  and in this orchard accounts for less than of the partnership s macadamia nut production 
d the nut purchase contract for the ka u o orchards purchased in may uses only the two year trailing usda average to determine its nut price  which was in  in and in e mauna loa has recently provided the final audited nut price to the partnership  which was not materially different from the estimate used in our financial statements 
the calculations have not yet been reviewed by the partnership 
the average nut price from all orchards declined from the average nut price from all orchards declined from the usda portion fell in and in  representing the lower prices paid by mauna loa after the sale of the company to the shansby group 
the netback was flat in compared to and declined in compared to the current netback price is the lowest in the history of the partnership and reflects the operating performance of mauna loa 
the usda published price for the crop year was per pound wis at moisture  which is higher than the price of and lower than the price of 
the usda two year trailing average  which affects the partnership s nut price  will be  a decrease over the two year average 
owned orchard segment cost of goods sold agricultural unit costs depend on the operating expenses required to maintain the orchards and to harvest the crop as well as on the quantity of nuts actually harvested 
the partnership s unit costs expressed in dollars per wet in shell pound at moisture are calculated by dividing all agricultural costs for each orchard including lease rent  property tax  tree insurance and depreciation by the number of pounds of macadamia nuts produced by that orchard and are summarized below lb

all orchards as a result of the farming operations acquisition  the partnership now farms its own orchards  and some costs previously charged as farming expenses by kaci and mkaci were eliminated 
these are the hawaii general excise tax  capital recovery costs and the farming fee 
the partnership saved approximately  in hawaii general excise taxes for   in and  for the last eight months of the capital recovery savings in were  in were  and in were  the elimination of the farming fee in saved the partnership  in   in and  in the general and administrative expense in was  and in was  in addition  the general and administrative expenses incurred in the farming operation  which were previously billed and expensed as farming costs  have been classified for the may to december period as general and administration expenses 
this amounted to  in   in and  in cost of goods sold was  lower in than in  and  higher in than in  but the cost per pound was higher in than and less in than the lower production costs in were the result of lower production  but the increase in the cost per pound was a result of increases in service costs such as insurance  and benefits 
the higher costs in were a result of the larger harvest 
lower production costs in were due to the savings mentioned above and to a much smaller harvest in farming segment farming service revenue in connection with the acquisition  the partnership acquired approximately farming contracts to farm macadamia orchards owned by other growers 
these contracts cover macadamia orchards in the same three locations on the island of hawaii where the partnership owns orchards 
the farming contracts provide the partnership to be reimbursed for all direct farming costs cultivation  irrigation and harvesting  collect a pro rata share of indirect costs and overheads  and charge a management fee 
the management fee is based on the number of acres farmed or on a percentage of total costs billed 
revenues from farming services were million in  million for and for may to december were million 
the farming service revenues were less than anticipated in part as a result of a controversy surrounding the sale by c 
brewer co  ltd 
cbcl of approximately tree acres to third parties 
cbcl reported to the partnership that the buyers of the orchards did not wish to assume the farming contracts  therefore  cbcl was terminating the contracts 
the partnership believes the contracts are not terminable at will and is currently negotiating a settlement with cbcl 
also  in one of the major farming contracts requested longer harvest intervals for their orchards 
the farming services revenue was less than anticipated due to the abandonment of acres by one of the growers and less repairs required 
the total in was less than expected by the partnership due to the november rainstorm and flood  which prohibited harvesting in some of the orchards under contract in the ka u region due to damage and debris in the orchards 
farming segment cost of services sold the cost of services sold relating to the farming contracts was million in  million for and million for the may to december period of these costs were all reimbursed to the partnership 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses are comprised of accounting and reporting costs  reimbursements to the managing partner for directors fees  office expenses and liability insurance  and the management fee 
in addition  general and administrative costs are also incurred in connection with the farming operations 
previous to the may acquisition  general and administration costs relating to the partnership s orchards were included in the partnership s farming expenses 
total general and administrative costs for were  less than  which is attributed to lower legal costs and higher service costs 
general and administrative costs for were  higher than in all of the increase was due to  in legal costs associated with the dispute related to the nut purchase contract with mauna loa 
with the acquisition  the partnership also provided certain accounting services to subsidiaries of cbcl 
these services generated income of  in the partnership did not expect to provide any accounting services after a management fee based on partnership cash flow is payable annually to the managing partner 
the amount paid was  in   for  and  for interest income and expense the partnership recorded interest expense of  in   in and  in this was due to the long term loan used to acquire the farming operations  the assumption of several capitalized equipment leases  and interest expense on a revolving line of credit 
the partnership funds its working capital needs through funds on hand and  when needed  from short term borrowings  generating interest expense in the process 
net interest income or expense  therefore  is partly a function of any balance carried over from the prior year  the amount and timing of cash generated and distributions paid to investors in the current year  as well as the current level of interest rates 
interest was earned in the amount of  in and  in primarily from charges to mauna loa for late payment in and the settlement in during interest income was earned in the amount of  other income of  was recorded in primarily from the early termination of a land and garage lease with cbcl 
other income of  was recorded in due mainly to the settlement agreement with mauna loa 
 was recorded in due to a claim received on a crop insurance policy for the crop 
production in some fields in the ka u region were lower than their ten year average by more than a deductible in due to the drought in that region 
inflation and taxes in general  prices paid to macadamia nut farmers fluctuate independently of inflation 
macadamia nut prices are influenced strongly by prices for finished macadamia products  which depend on competition and consumer acceptance 
farming costs  particularly labor and materials  and general and administrative costs do generally reflect inflationary trends 
the partnership is subject to a gross income tax as a result of its election to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than to be taxed as a corporation  as allowed by the taxpayer relief act of this tax is calculated at on partnership gross income net revenues less cost of goods sold beginning in the gross income tax was  in   in  and  in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in  which was the same as net cash provided by operations was million in compared with million in on december  the partnership s working capital was million and its current ratio was to  compared to million and to in and was million and to in in payment by mauna loa resulted in liabilities being paid without incurring short term debt 
the higher working capital for compared to is due to the settlement with mauna loa and cost controls 
the partnership is in compliance with the credit agreement covenants 
capital expenditures in were  and in were  in capital expenditures were million  all due to the orchards and farming operations acquisition 
capital expenditures planned for are less than  and are expected to be financed by way of new equipment leases 
macadamia nut farming is seasonal  with production peaking late in the fall 
however  farming operations continue year round 
as a result  additional working capital is required for much of the year 
the partnership meets its working capital needs with cash on hand  and when necessary  through short term borrowings under a million revolving line of credit 
the line of credit was obtained on may  and expires may  at december  the partnership had a cash balance of  and line of credit drawings outstanding of  at december  the partnership had a cash balance of  and line of credit drawings outstanding of  the cash balance was  at the end of  and the line of credit drawings were  at december  the partnership has reached agreement in principle to purchase approximately  acres of land currently under long term leases from cbcl for million 
a definite purchase agreement has not yet been signed and neither party is currently under a legal obligation to close the transaction 
if the transaction closes it will probably close in the second quarter of the partnership has received a tentative commitment to finance the acquisition under a new credit facility 
it is the opinion of management that the partnership has adequate cash on hand and borrowing capacity available to meet anticipated working capital needs for operations as presently conducted 
however  with the september sale of mauna loa  the managing partner no longer has control over the timing of nut payments to the partnership 
the nut purchase contracts require mauna loa to make nut payments days after the end of each quarter 
during certain parts of the year  if payments are not received  as the contracts require  available cash resources could be depleted 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the partnership s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the partnership s financial statements 
the preparation of the partnership s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the partnership s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates those estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance  compensation and related benefits  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies and litigation 
the partnership states these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to the partnership and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
the partnership believes that the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of it financial statements the partnership maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  or if a customer refuses to pay or disputes any such payment  additional allowances may be required 
the partnership maintains accruals for workers compensation self insurance  which are classified in other accrued liabilities in the balance sheet 
management determines the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating the historical experience and projected trends related to this accrual 
if such information indicates that the accrual is over or understated  the partnership will adjust the assumptions utilized in the methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accrual as appropriate 
retirement benefits the partnership sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan for union employees 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to this plan 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  withdrawal and mortality rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
the actuarial assumptions used by the partnership may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter mortality of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of retirement benefit expense recorded by the partnership in future periods 
the partnership reviews long lived assets held and used  or held for sale for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment charge is required 
all long lived assets for which management has committed to a plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
changes in projected cash flows generated by an asset based on new events or circumstances may indicate a change in fair value and require a new evaluation of recoverability of the asset 
legal proceedings mauna loa 
the partnership is a party to five macadamia nut purchase contracts with mauna loa 
three of these contracts  one written in and two in  require mauna loa to pay for all nuts delivered 
since the inception of these three contracts  mauna loa has always paid for all nuts delivered 
the other two nut purchase contracts were written in and and allow for the deduction of unusable nuts in calculating payment due 
on october   a dispute arose with mauna loa regarding the payment for nuts delivered by the partnership during the year 
in violation of the nut purchase contracts and past practice  mauna loa deducted  for certain substandard nuts related to the and contracts 
a demand letter was sent  litigation ensued and a motion for summary judgment was entered in may against mauna loa  awarding principal  and interest and attorneys fees to the partnership 
settlement discussions followed the judgment in order to avoid an appeal and further litigation 
the partnership agreed to accept principal  interest and a portion of its legal fees along with a complete release by both parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the partnership has market risk exposure on its credit agreement due to its variable rate pricing that is based on rates based on libor  the farm credit discount note rate and the farm credit medium term note rate 
as of december   a one percent increase or decrease in the applicable rate under the credit agreement will result in an interest expense fluctuation of approximately  item b 
controls and procedures a under the supervision and with the participation of management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures  as such term is defined under rule a c promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  within days of the filing date of this report 
based on their evaluation  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the partnership s disclosure procedures are effective 
b there have been no significant changes including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation referenced in paragraph a above
