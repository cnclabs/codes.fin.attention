item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview our operations consist of wholly owned casino resorts in las vegas and other locations in southern nevada  detroit  michigan  biloxi  mississippi  and darwin  australia  as well as investments in joint ventures with an operating resort on the las vegas strip and a project under development in atlantic city  new jersey 
while our resorts cater to various market segments  our general strategy is to offer a premium resort experience with high quality gaming and non gaming amenities 
we generate slightly over half of our net revenues from gaming activities 
our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts  which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 
key volume indicators are table games drop and slot handle gaming volume indicators  and hotel occupancy hotel volume indicators 
price for rooms is indicated by our average daily rate adr 
our revenues can also be affected by the percentage of gaming volume we retain  indicated by win or hold percentage  which is not fully controllable by us 
our table games hold percentage is typically in the range of to 
our revenues can be affected by economic and other factors 
domestic leisure travel is dependent on the national economy and the level of consumers disposable income 
our high end customers are largely foreign  primarily from the far east  and our revenues from these customers can be affected by economic conditions in their regions and the global economy as a whole 
several factors impacted our operating results for the years ended december  and  resulting primarily from the attacks of september  before the attacks  results were strong at our resorts  especially on the las vegas strip  despite the fact that the united states economy was in a recession for much of the attacks caused an immediate and profound impact on our operations 
our resorts on the las vegas strip experienced unprecedented low occupancy levels in the weeks following the attacks  approximately from september to september  at room rates substantially below those of comparable prior periods 
the effects on leisure and business travel continued through and into  though our resorts occupancy and room rates have recovered to levels more in line with prior periods 
we responded to the attacks with several operating changes that led to restructuring charges in the third and fourth quarters of and a lower operating cost structure in the periods since the attacks 
we laid off or terminated approximately  employees on a full time equivalent basis at our nevada operations and employees at beau rivage in biloxi  mississippi 
we also recorded asset write downs and impairment changes in the third quarter of  increased our reserves for doubtful accounts and health claims  and lowered the carrying value of certain retail inventories 
national economic factors have been moderate at best  and the stock market declines experienced in have impacted the level of consumer confidence and  potentially  consumer spending 
compared with net revenues for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of million  or  versus net revenues of billion 
net revenues through the first nine months of trailed net revenues  due to the continued impacts of the attacks of september  net revenues for the fourth quarter of were ahead of due to the relatively easy comparisons to the post september period in consolidated casino revenues for were billion  an increase of over billion of casino revenues in the prior year 
table games revenues were down 
volume decreased in  due to weakness in international high end play in early and weakness in national high end play in late  which we believe is the result of weak economic conditions in the united states and a continued pattern of declines in the stock market 
our overall table games hold percentage was within a normal range in both years 
slot revenues increased by  which includes strong performances at mgm grand detroit  where the market continued its growth throughout most of  and bellagio  which benefited from new slot department management 
consolidated room revenues of million in were roughly flat with occupancy at our resorts in was even with at  while our adr increased by to room trends throughout the year were consistent with overall net revenue trends 
consolidated food and beverage  entertainment  retail and other revenues were billion for  an increase of million  or  over the results for excluding revenues of million in received for the early termination of our management agreement covering four casinos in the republic of south africa  the increase was over prior year 
we have actively managed the mix of dining and entertainment amenities at several of our larger resorts during  including the addition of new nightclubs and restaurants  and the replacement of restaurants and shows with new concepts 
consolidated operating expenses decreased from billion in to billion in  due to expense reductions implemented after the events of september described earlier  and lower restructuring costs and write downs and impairments 
consolidated operating expenses before preopening and start up expenses  restructuring costs and write downs and impairments were billion for  compared to billion in the prior year 
expenses in included million of charges to bring bad debt  health claim and retail inventory reserves to appropriate levels in light of changes in our operations following the september attacks 
corporate expense was million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year  due to increased payroll  insurance and property tax costs 
during the third and fourth quarters of  management responded to a decline in business volumes caused by the september attacks by implementing cost containment strategies which included a significant reduction in payroll and a refocusing of several of our marketing programs 
approximately  employees on a full time equivalent basis were laid off or terminated  resulting in a million charge against earnings  primarily related to the accrual of severance pay  extended health care coverage and other related costs in connection with these personnel reductions 
as a result of improving business levels and our success at re hiring a substantial number of previously laid off or terminated employees  management determined in the second quarter of that a portion of the remaining accrual would now not be necessary 
this resulted in a restructuring credit of million 
in december  we recorded a restructuring credit of million related to a lease contract termination accrual originally recorded in june the contract termination provided for payments based on the results of a successor tenant  and in december we determined that payment under this obligation is not probable 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in december related to contract termination costs for a restaurant lease and the efx show at mgm grand las vegas 
in  we recorded write downs and impairments of million 
in september  tropical storm isidore caused property damage at beau rivage totaling million  including clean up costs 
the amount of the write down for damaged assets was determined based on the net book value of the assets and engineering estimates 
in connection with the revised development agreement in detroit see discussion in liquidity and capital resources  we wrote off million  which is the net book value of previously incurred development costs associated with the riverfront permanent casino site million  offset by previously accrued obligations no longer required under the revised development agreement million 
in december  we recorded million of write downs and impairments  which represented the net book value of assets abandoned or replaced with new construction 
in the third quarter of  we reassessed the carrying value of certain assets and recognized an impairment charge of million 
approximately million of this charge related to a write down of our land held for sale on the atlantic city boardwalk 
this write down resulted from a reassessment of the fair value of the land subsequent to the attacks  and was based on comparable sales data adjusted for the impact of recently enacted legislation authorizing large scale gaming in the state of new york 
management believes this legislation had a negative impact on real estate values on the atlantic city boardwalk 
the remaining charge relates to several assets abandoned during the quarter in response to the september attacks  primarily in progress construction projects which management terminated during the quarter 
income from unconsolidated affiliate of million represents our share of the operating results of monte carlo for our share of that entity s results was million in monte carlo s results were affected by many of the same trends as our wholly owned las vegas strip resorts 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  was million for versus million in the prior year 
total interest cost was million in versus million in this decrease reflected lower debt balances in and lower market interest rates  which affect the rate we pay on our credit facilities 
interest capitalized declined from million in to million in  due to the lower debt balances and interest rates described above  along with the cessation of capitalized interest on our wholly owned development project at renaissance pointe in atlantic city 
compared with net revenues for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of million  or  versus the billion recorded in the mirage properties bellagio  the mirage  treasure island  golden nugget las vegas  golden nugget laughlin  beau rivage and boardwalk generated net revenues of billion  an increase of billion versus their seven month results in net revenues at the mgm grand properties mgm grand las vegas  new york new york  the primm valley resorts  mgm grand detroit  mgm grand australia and mgm grand south africa declined by million  or  to billion 
the decrease in revenues at the mgm grand properties was concentrated in the casino area 
consolidated casino revenues for were billion  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the mirage properties generated casino revenues of billion in  an increase of million over their seven month results in  while casino revenues at the mgm grand properties decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was principally the result of declines of million  million and million at mgm grand las vegas  mgm grand detroit and the primm valley resorts  respectively 
these declines were all attributable primarily to reduced gaming volumes 
the volume decreases at mgm grand las vegas are attributable to the impact of the september attacks 
the primm valley resorts were faced with increased competition from native american casinos  as well as the impact of higher gasoline and utility costs in california  while volumes at mgm grand detroit were impacted by a competitor s opening of the third and final detroit casino in november the declines in detroit were offset in part by improved volumes in the fourth quarter of  as traffic delays caused by increased border security caused a shift in volume away from a competitor casino in windsor  ontario 
consolidated room revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
room revenues at the mirage properties totaled million  an increase of million over the seven month results from room revenues at the mgm grand properties declined by only despite the significant impact on business following the september attacks  reflecting the strength of our hotel business prior to september mgm grand las vegas benefited from having more available rooms during versus  as a room remodeling project had been ongoing in the prior year  and also achieved a small increase in average daily room rate 
consolidated food and beverage  entertainment  retail and other revenues were billion for  an increase of million  or  over the results for the mirage properties contributed a million increase  as revenues were million for versus million for the seven month period in food and beverage  entertainment  retail and other revenues at the mgm grand properties declined by only from the comparable levels  despite the impact on business of the september attacks 
consolidated operating expenses were billion in compared to billion in  due to the full year of mirage results offset by a decrease in expenses at the mgm grand properties and lower restructuring costs 
consolidated operating expenses before preopening expenses  restructuring costs  and write downs and impairments were billion for  an increase of million  or  over the billion reported in the prior year 
as noted above  operating revenues at the mgm grand properties declined by versus their results from  while increased energy costs and intensified competitive conditions  particularly with respect to the primm valley resorts  led to increased expenses 
additionally  expenses included the charges related to the september attacks referred to earlier 
the results include the restructuring costs and write downs and impairments previously discussed 
during the year ended december   management implemented comprehensive restructuring plans designed to reduce costs and improve efficiencies within the company 
the implementation of these plans resulted in a charge against earnings totaling million  primarily related to consolidation of certain general and administrative functions at new york new york and mgm grand las vegas  various contract terminations and staffing reductions  the buyout of various leases and other related items 
approximately people were affected by the reductions  primarily at our operating resorts excluding the mirage properties relating to duplicative functions within marketing  entertainment  retail  information systems and human resources 
during june  we recognized a charge against earnings of million for write downs and impairments 
approximately million of the charge related to projects previously under development which management  in june  determined not to pursue  driven by changes in strategy resulting from the acquisition of mirage 
significant elements of this charge were a write down to fair value based on recent comparable market sales of land on the atlantic city boardwalk million  which was reclassified as held for sale  a write down to fair value  based on solicited offers  of a golf course under development million that was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of  and a write off of costs previously incurred for the development of a hotel tower at mgm grand las vegas million 
approximately million of the june charge related to losses on the abandonment  disposal or divestiture of certain non strategic assets during the second quarter of  primarily in progress construction and information systems projects which management terminated during the quarter 
the remaining charge million resulted from the closure of the mgm grand las vegas theme park 
the equipment and related theme park assets were written down to salvage value  determined by reference to comparable assets  based on management s strategic decision not to operate a theme park and to sell the theme park assets 
corporate expense increased significantly in the first half of as a result of the mirage acquisition  then decreased significantly in the second half of the year  reflecting our progress in integrating corporate functions following the acquisition and our focus on cost containment after the september attacks 
for the year  corporate expense was million  an increase of over the amount recorded in income from unconsolidated affiliate of million represents our share of the operating results of monte carlo for our share of that entity s results was million for the seven months following the mirage acquisition in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  was million for versus million in the prior year 
total interest cost was million in versus million in this increase reflected higher average debt levels attributable to the financing of the mirage acquisition  offset in part by savings associated with interest rate swaps and a significant reduction in interest rates on borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
capitalized interest declined from million in to million in due to higher capitalized interest associated with our atlantic city development offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from the january suspension of interest capitalization on our las vegas strip development 
at that time  we announced that our near term development focus would be on the atlantic city market 
capitalized interest in atlantic city in represented a full year of interest capitalization on our atlantic city development projects versus seven months of capitalization in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows as of december  and december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared with million for and million for the increase in was due primarily to improved operating results 
investing cash flows cash used for investing activities was million in  compared to million in and billion in capital expenditures in were million  which includes general property improvements at our resorts  such as room remodel projects at the mirage and golden nugget las vegas  new restaurant and nightclub development at several of our resorts  and various other remodeling projects 
other capital expenditures included costs incurred to implement igt s ez pay system  players club and other slot technology  the costs of our players club system development  as well as pre construction activities  including capitalized interest  in atlantic city 
in  capital expenditures were million 
a large portion of the capital expenditures related to general property improvements at our resorts  such as the ongoing room refurbishment program at the mirage and restaurant and entertainment enhancements at mgm grand las vegas and new york new york 
other capital expenditures included the construction of the primm center at the primm valley resorts  the completion of the mirage events center  the acquisition of the building housing mgm grand detroit  the acquisition of a new corporate aircraft and pre construction activities  including capitalized interest  associated with ongoing development projects 
we spent million on capital expenditures in  including expenditures related to general property improvements at our resorts  including the room refurbishment program at mgm grand las vegas 
other capital expenditures included the acquisition of land by mgm grand detroit and other land acquisitions and pre construction activities  including capitalized interest  associated with ongoing development projects 
in  we contributed million to the monte carlo joint venture in connection with the joint venture s retirement of the final million of its outstanding debt 
also in  we made million of capital contributions to borgata  a limited liability company owned with boyd gaming corporation 
boyd is overseeing the construction of the  room hotel casino resort on a acre portion of the renaissance pointe site  and will operate the resort upon completion 
construction is expected to be completed in the summer of at a total estimated cost  including land  of approximately billion 
in december  we contributed the acres of land and boyd contributed million in cash to the venture  and the venture obtained a million secured bank credit facility  which is non recourse to mgm mirage  to fund the project costs 
we and boyd are each required to contribute up to an additional million in cash to the venture and boyd is required to contribute any additional cash necessary to fund project costs in excess of the agreed project budget 
as of december   each partner had made million of such additional cash contributions to the venture  including contributions made by mirage prior to the acquisition 
as required by our agreement with boyd  we have designed and are developing the common roads  landscaping and other master plan improvements for the entire renaissance pointe site 
as part of the agreement with the city  we are required to remediate environmental contamination at the site  which was a municipal landfill for many years 
a substantial portion of the remediation work has been completed 
on october   we announced the suspension of our development activities on our wholly owned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city 
in connection with that announcement  we stopped capitalizing interest associated with the project 
on may   we completed the mirage acquisition whereby mirage shareholders received per share in cash 
funds needed to complete the acquisition were approximately billion 
these funds were used for payments to mirage shareholders and holders of mirage stock options  refinancing of certain indebtedness of mirage and mgm grand  and payment of fees and expenses in connection with the mirage acquisition 
in order to fund the mirage acquisition  we borrowed billion under our senior credit facilities  completed the private placement of million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately billion  issued million of senior subordinated notes and used cash on hand to fund the remaining balance 
financing cash flows cash flows used in financing activities were million in  compared to million used in financing activities in and billion provided by financing activities in during  we repaid million of bank debt  compared to million of repayments in and billion of net borrowings in our credit facilities at the beginning of consisted of a million  day revolving credit facility and a billion credit facility maturing in may on april   we entered into an amendment to our million revolving credit facility whereby the maturity date was extended to april  and the lending commitment was reduced to million 
on september   we entered into a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank  which line of credit expires on april  as of december   we had approximately million of available liquidity under our bank credit facilities 
we intend to renew the million revolving credit facility at or before its maturity  with total availability at or near the existing availability 
in january  moody s investment services lowered its rating on our senior notes to one level below investment grade bal 
as a result  substantially all of our assets other than assets of our foreign subsidiaries and certain assets in use at mgm grand detroit were pledged as collateral for our senior notes  excluding subordinated notes and the million line of credit  and our billion and million subsequently reduced to million revolving credit facilities 
we do not believe the downgrade has had  or will have  a significant effect on our liquidity or our ability to secure short term or long term financing 
subsequent to the downgrade  we successfully extended the maturity date of our million revolving credit facility to april  and voluntarily reduced the commitment to million 
the amendment was entered into with the same pricing and other terms as our previous facility 
on may   our shelf registration statement  which allows us to issue up to a total of billion of debt and equity securities from time to time in public offerings  was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
we issued million of senior subordinated notes in may to partially fund the mirage acquisition 
we also issued million of senior notes in september and million of senior subordinated notes in january  the proceeds of which were used to partially repay the billion term loan component of the senior facilities 
after giving effect to these issuances  the shelf registration statement has million in remaining capacity at december  for the issuance of future debt or equity securities 
any future public offering of securities under the shelf registration statement will only be made by means of a prospectus supplement 
we repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of million in the year ended december   under a million share stock repurchase program authorized in august we had purchased million shares at a cost of million under this authorization in in january  the company repurchased the remaining million shares allowed under this authorization at a cost of million 
in february  the board of directors approved a new million share repurchase program 
we repurchased million shares at a cost of million in under a program approved in and suspended in february in  and  million  million and million  respectively  stock options were exercised pursuant to our stock option plans  resulting in proceeds to us of million  million and million  respectively 
future development mgm grand detroit  llc  in which we hold a controlling interest  has operated an interim casino facility in detroit  michigan since july   and has been planning a permanent casino facility under a development agreement with the city of detroit 
on august  the detroit city council approved revised development agreements with us and two other developers 
the revised development agreement released us and the city from certain of the obligations under the original agreement and significantly changed other provisions of the original agreement 
the revised development agreement contemplates that our permanent casino facility will open by january we are currently in the process of obtaining land and developing plans for the permanent facility  and currently expect the project to cost approximately million including land  capitalized interest and preopening expenses  but excluding approximately million of payments to the city under the revised development agreement 
the design  budget and schedule of the permanent facility are at an early stage  and the ultimate timing  cost and scope of the facility is subject to risks attendant to large scale projects 
the ability to construct the permanent casino facility is currently subject to resolution of certain litigation 
in january  the th circuit court of appeals ruled that the ordinance governing the casino developer selection process in detroit violated the first amendment to the united states constitution  because of preference given to certain bidders 
our operating subsidiary did not receive preference in the selection process 
the thcircuit court remanded the case to the federal district court  which rejected the plaintiff s request for a re bidding process and determined that the only suitable remedy to the plaintiff was declaring the ordinance unconstitutional 
the plaintiff has appealed  and the th circuit court has issued an injunction  pending appeal  prohibiting the city and the developers from commencing construction pending further action of the th circuit court 
see item iii  legal proceedings  for further information 
in october  we announced an agreement with international game technology igt to install igt s ez pay cashless gaming system in approximately  of our slot machines across our resorts 
the project has an estimated cost of million  including the cost of new machines and the cost of modifying existing machines  and will be completed by mid management believes the project will enhance both the customer experience and the revenue potential of our slot machines 
we announced in july our intention to expand our bellagio resort 
as presently contemplated  the expansion will consist of a room spa tower  new restaurant and retail amenities  expansion of the existing spa and salon facilities  and additional meeting room space 
estimated cost of the expansion is million  including preopening and start up expenses and capitalized interest  and we expect to complete the project in late we expect to finance operations  capital expenditures and existing debt obligations through cash flow from operations  cash on hand  bank credit facilities and  depending on market conditions  public offerings of securities under the shelf registration statement 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of joint venture arrangements and other investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which currently consist of our investments in monte carlo and borgata 
we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps 
our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the benefits of owning a full scale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment 
we have not guaranteed financing obtained by the ventures  nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks we would not be subjected to if we had full ownership of the resort 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  of which million support the bonds issued by the economic development corporation of the city of detroit for which we are obligated  and which are included in the detroit development obligations 
this obligation was undertaken to secure our right to develop a permanent casino in detroit 
a million letter of credit supports our requirement to make additional equity contributions to borgata 
the remaining letters of credit support our payment obligations for normal trade activities  such as the purchase of goods and services 
our contractual obligations consist of long term debt  capital leases  operating leases  obligations under the revised development agreement in detroit  obligations for joint venture contributions  and purchase obligations 
the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  thereafter in millions long term debt   capital leases operating leases detroit development obligations joint venture contributions in addition to the detroit development obligations above  we have indemnified the city of detroit up to million as it relates to the lac vieux litigation and inverse condemnation claims arising from the city of detroit s efforts to locate the three casino projects along the detroit river 
this guarantee obligation has been accrued as part of the total amount to be paid to the city of detroit for our right to develop a permanent casino  but the timing of payment under the indemnification is uncertain 
we enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of business  for which commitments are recorded and recognized as liabilities when services are performed 
for major construction projects  we typically commit to contracts for major project elements before construction begins 
at december   we were committed for a total of approximately million on construction projects  including the bellagio spa tower expansion and theatre remodel projects at new york new york 
we are also committed for approximately million under a contract with igt for the ez pay project 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources md a is based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio  mgm grand las vegas and the mirage 
our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent  although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well  with the exception of mgm grand australia  where northern territory legislation prohibits marker play 
we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely 
these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts  including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices  personal contacts  the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation 
markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states 
markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries  but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states 
a significant portion of our casino accounts receivable is owed by casino customers from the far east 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our casino accounts receivable was owed by such customers 
we maintain an allowance  or reserve  for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts 
the provision for doubtful accounts  an operating expense  increases the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts 
at resorts where marker play is not significant  the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances 
at resorts where marker play is significant  we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount  based on the customer s financial condition  collection history and any other known information 
we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 
the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors  including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customer s home countries 
because individual customer account balances can be significant  the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods  as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region s economy occur 
the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables at december  and at december  in thousands casino accounts receivable   allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable   allowance for doubtful casino accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable median age of casino accounts receivable days days percentage of casino accounts receivable outstanding over days the allowance percentage increased after the attacks of september  due to the effect of the attacks on our customers traveling patterns and global economic conditions 
we experienced better than anticipated receivable collections on certain customer accounts during  which resulted in a reversal of previously recorded bad debt provision in the third quarter of even after this reversal  our percentage of accounts estimated to be uncollectible remains consistent with levels we consider appropriate given current global economic conditions 
at december   a basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by million  or per share 
fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we account for construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
when we construct assets  we capitalize direct costs of the project  including fees paid to architects and contractors  property taxes  rent and the cost of our design and construction subsidiary  mgm mirage design group 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest cost sfas  interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project 
capitalization of interest starts when construction activities  as defined in sfas  begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also may be a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets  engineering studies  and our estimate of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we change that life prospectively 
whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on management s actions 
in january  we announced that our near term development focus would be on the atlantic city market 
as a result  we suspended the capitalization of interest on our las vegas strip project until the development process for that project is further advanced 
interest capitalized on this project was million for the seven months ended december  and million in until we stopped capitalizing interest 
in october  we announced the suspension of development activities on our wholly owned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city 
in connection with that announcement  we stopped capitalizing interest associated with the project 
interest capitalized on this project for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model 
if an asset is still under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
all recognized impairment losses  whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used  are recorded as operating expenses 
there are several estimates  assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of fixed assets 
first  management must determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold  it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
this means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
on a quarterly basis  we review our major fixed assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment 
we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets 
when appropriate  we discount future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital  developed using a standard capital asset pricing model 
whenever an impairment loss is recorded  or a test for impairment is made  we discuss the facts and circumstances with the audit committee 
see results of operations for discussion of write downs and impairments recorded in  and in october  we announced that we are temporarily suspending our development activities on our wholly owned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city 
in connection therewith  we reviewed the land for potential impairment  and determined no impairment was indicated 
other than these items  we are not aware of events or circumstances that would cause us to review any material long lived assets for impairment 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states  and in several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets and billion of deferred tax liabilities 
except for certain new jersey state net operating losses and certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
the valuation allowance at december  related to the new jersey deferred tax assets was million 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent on our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
in december  we settled the irs audit of the company s and tax returns  which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
the tax returns for years after are still under examination or are subject to possible future examination 
the company acquired mirage on may  the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities of mirage resorts have been consolidated with the mgm mirage deferred balances 
the tax returns of mirage resorts for the years through the date of the acquisition are currently under examination by the irs 
any future adjustments to mirage s acquired tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill recognized in the acquisition 
accounting principles adopted in accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was issued in june and adopted by us on january  the statement provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized effective january   but are instead reviewed for impairment within six months of adoption of the statement and at least annually thereafter 
we completed the necessary impairment reviews in the second and fourth quarters of and  as a result of our reviews  did not record any impairment charges 
the adoption of this statement has lowered our depreciation and amortization expense  and increased operating income and net income 
amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets sfas discussed above in critical accounting policies was issued in august and adopted by us on january  the statement requires one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the statement essentially carried forward existing guidance on determining whether an impairment has occurred and calculating any impairment loss 
therefore  the adoption of this statement has not had  nor do we expect it to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
recently issued accounting standards classification of gains and losses as extraordinary items in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements   and  amendment of fasb statement  and technical corrections as of april sfas 
the key provision of sfas that affects us rescinds the existing rule that all gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items 
instead  such gains and losses must be analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria for extraordinary item classification based on the event being both unusual and infrequent 
we will adopt sfas beginning january  prior period losses must be analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria to be classified as extraordinary items 
if they fail the criteria  prior period losses must be reclassified 
we anticipate that our prior period losses will be reclassified as an element of income from continuing operations 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan  as previously required under eitf issue examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we will adopt sfas beginning january  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
the time between our commitment to an exit or disposal plan and when costs are actually incurred is typically short 
guarantee obligations in november  the financial accounting standards board issued its interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that future guarantee obligations be recognized as liabilities at inception of the guarantee contract 
it also increases the disclosures required for current and future guarantee obligations 
we have included the disclosures required by fin in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt the initial recognition provisions of fin to guarantees entered into after december  we do not believe the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas increases the disclosure requirements for companies which do not voluntarily adopt the fair value based accounting for employee stock compensation prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas on a retroactive basis 
sfas also requires companies to present the pro forma disclosures in interim financial statements 
we have included the annual disclosures required by sfas in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  and will present the required interim disclosures commencing with our financial statements for the quarter ending march  market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and commercial paper program 
at december   long term fixed rate borrowings represented approximately of our total borrowings 
assuming a basis point change in libor  the primary index on which our floating rate debt is based  our annual interest cost would change by approximately million 
in  we entered into several interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  which effectively converted a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
in the second quarter of  we terminated all remaining interest rate swaps  which at the time covered million of our fixed rate debt 
we received net payments totaling million during and upon the termination of interest rate swaps agreements 
these amounts have been added to the carrying value of the related debt obligations and are being amortized and recorded as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of that debt
