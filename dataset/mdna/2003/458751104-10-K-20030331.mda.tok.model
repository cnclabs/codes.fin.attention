item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the need for intuitive interface devices we believe traditional remote control devices are not well suited for evolving user requirements 
in the home environment  entertainment systems are increasing in complexity  more applications and content can be accessed on each system  and multiple components of a system are often used simultaneously 
business presentation devices are also offering more sophisticated control options 
however  the remote control devices that are typically used to control applications and systems in the home and business environment are not intuitive and are often difficult to use 
they contain many buttons  which require users to memorize or look up each function of each button 
users often need several control devices  such as a remote and a wireless keyboard  to access multiple applications  such as digital tv content  internet based communication and commerce  and the telephone 
the multiplicity of individual devices or buttons or sequences of buttons on a single device required to control the related system also requires the user to look directly at the interface device in order to select the correct button or button sequence 
this is distracting in the case of business presentations and may be undesirable in the home entertainment environment if the user is in a darkened room or does not want to miss something in the visual presentation 
the typical remote control device operates on infrared  or ir  technology  which does not work well over long distances or if there are intervening objects  such as furniture 
although  some remote communication functions are best addressed using ir technology and the majority of current systems are set to up receive ir signals  by itself ir technology has significant limitations 
ir signals also interfere with each other  which prevents the use of multiple ir signals in a single room  significantly limiting 
table of contents interactivity between the remote and the multiple devices it controls and making bi directional communication impossible 
finally  traditional ir technology is slow and narrows bandwidth  limiting the complexity of data that can be transmitted 
in the e transactions market  businesses seeking to automate workflow or conduct e commerce transactions need a hardware and software solution that can be used to capture signatures  bind them to documents  and authenticate and verify them 
there are few cost effective turnkey solutions commercially available that can be deployed  requiring businesses to develop proprietary software and hardware solutions 
the interlink solution we use our suite of proprietary intuitive interface technologies to create devices that enable users to operate and control computers  televisions  projectors and other complex electronic systems 
by enabling interactivity between interface devices and the systems they control  we allow users to interact directly with menu driven application programs resident in the controlled system through an on screen display 
our devices enable the use of high bandwidth applications such as telephony and provide an intuitive interface for applications encompassing the functions typically associated with computers  such as browsing the internet and sending and receiving e mail 
for instance  our new interface device for next generation digital set top boxes integrates cursorless navigation  text entry  freehand writing and drawing and voice transmission capabilities within a single lightweight  hand held platform 
the device enables total control of various home entertainment options available yet retain a highly intuitive user interface and a sleek ergonomic design 
our interface devices offer a number of benefits not available using traditional technologies easy to use sensor technology 
the vast majority of our products include our patented fsr technology 
the fsr  or force sensing resistor  combined with other interlink electronics technologies  creates a pointing device that responds to pressure and can accept input from a finger or a pen 
it also consumes minimal power  making it ideal for use in a battery powered interface device 
in conjunction with patent pending pad to screen mapping and gestures technology  our fsr touchpads provide an intuitive means of communicating with a wide array of applications and systems 
the fsr is also ideally suited for capturing high resolution electronic signatures 
innovative software applications 
our pad to screen  or pts mapping technology  for which we have a patent  allows a user to touch a point on an fsr touchpad to activate a button or menu item in a corresponding on screen location 
this capability eliminates the need to click or cursor through various intervening menu items 
using pts mapping  a user can easily and quickly perform a number of complex functions without looking at the remote device  including the operation of a virtual keyboard activated through the touchpad but appearing on the monitor 
our gesture technology  for which we have issued and pending patents  allows the user to input or write commands on a screen by touching and moving a finger or pen on a touchpad 
for example  a channel can be changed by tracing the channel number on the touchpad or  if a higher or lower channel is desired  by swiping to the right or left  as applicable  and continuing to touch the touchpad to scroll through the channel numbers 
other commands  such as play  record or pause are accomplished by making gestures that mimic the standard symbols for those functions appearing on vcrs  dvd players and other playback and recording devices 

table of contents enhanced wireless communications technology 
in addition to our patented wireless protocol  remotelink  we have developed expertise in industry wireless protocol standards  such as ir  radio frequency rf and bluetooth 
our patented remotelink wireless communications technology retains the ir technology necessary to communicate with most of today s information and entertainment systems and combines it with rf technology to overcome most of the shortcomings of traditional ir technology 
widely accepted functional and ergonomic designs 
our intuitive interface devices reflect our strong focus on functionality and ergonomics 
we maintain an active product design effort and devote considerable attention to issues related to ease of use of our products 
an example of the results of these efforts is our patented clicktrigger button incorporated in a number of our products  which enables the user to click on an icon on a monitor by squeezing a button with his or her index finger in a motion similar to pulling a trigger 
the interlink strategy we intend to use our suite of technologies to become the leading provider of intuitive interface devices for the home and business markets through the implementation of the following strategies we will work with home entertainment industry innovators to develop intuitive interface devices for interactive applications 
we will foster adoption of our intuitive interface devices for the home entertainment market by building technology partnerships with a variety of technology providers  such as manufacturers of digital set top boxes  front and rear projectors and plasma displays and developers of software applications 
because many of our oem customers in the business communications market are also participants in the market for home entertainment systems  we expect to use our relationships with them to facilitate the widespread adoption of our intuitive interface devices in the home entertainment market 
additionally  we will continue to support the usage of our fsr technology in the microsoft xbox program and any related products 
we will aggressively market our epad product line to the e transactions market 
we will foster adoption of our epad product line in the e transactions market by expanding distribution channels and building strategic relationships with key software and systems integrators to develop turnkey solutions for deployment in large corporate settings 
to foster adoption of the epad in the electronic document management market  we are working with electronic signature software companies like silanis technology  inc  valyd  inc 
and communication intelligence corporation 
we will maintain our leadership position in the business communications market 
we will seek to maintain our leadership position in the business communications market by continuing to provide our oem and reseller customers with innovative products that are responsive to consumer needs 
we also expect to introduce products for related ancillary markets  such as conference room and video conferencing controllers and conferencing automation products 
we will develop proprietary applications to expand our penetration into new markets 
we will develop either for ourselves or in partnership with other companies  software applications that enhance the functionality of our intuitive interface devices and will seek to license such applications where possible 
we intend to work with our customers and development partners to identify and develop applications that will meet customer needs and  where appropriate  to license these applications 

table of contents we will enhance our current technology and develop or acquire new technology and applications 
we will maintain an active technology development program that will enable us to enhance our current touchpad and wireless communication technologies and develop new technologies and applications for them 
we believe this continuing development will allow us to increase our market share in the markets in which we compete and identify new markets where our technologies can provide us with a competitive advantage 
where appropriate  we may acquire technologies from others or acquire companies that own or are developing technologies that we believe would allow us to enhance our product offerings 
products we have four principal product lines targeted at the business communications  home entertainment  e transactions and specialty components markets 
business communication products 
our remote interface devices are used by the business communications market to control presentation systems such as projectors 
our traditional interface devices incorporate a pointing button to control the cursor and one or more function selection buttons 
these products range from a simple interface device with only a pointing device and a single click button to devices with function keys 
most of these products incorporate our patented clicktrigger button 
we sell interface devices in the business communication market principally to oems and as branded products through a variety of distributors and value added resellers 
our current oem customers include some of the largest presentation system manufacturers  including  infocus corporation  nec corporation  sony corporation and toshiba corporation 
although most business presentation devices are made by japanese companies  the united states represents the largest market for these products 
accordingly  our oem sales are concentrated in japan and managed by our japanese subsidiary while our branded sales are primarily us based 
in  our business communication products accounted for of our sales 
our dominant market share of the oem market causes our sales of business communication products to mirror trends in the presentation industry 
this was the case in  when inventory adjustments and generally poor economic conditions resulted in reduced demand for new business presentation systems 
however  our relationships with our principal customers in these markets remains strong and  in some cases  is strengthening 
in  our business communication revenues began to recover as we added new oem customers and expanded our interlink branded product business 
home entertainment products 
the intuitouch product  our prototype intuitive interface device for home entertainment systems such as digital set top boxes  is based on a technological platform similar to our most advanced business communications devices 
the pad centric remote device integrates mouse pointing  text entry  freehand writing and drawing and voice transmission capabilities 
the device enables total control of the variety of home entertainment options available yet retains a highly intuitive user interface and an ergonomic design 
economic conditions in and resulted in substantial reductions in the rate of deployment of new broadband systems 
accordingly  our home entertainment development efforts have been focused on the design of interface devices that will be needed to support the advanced viewing devices that will be offered to consumers over the next few years  such as front and rear projectors  hdtv and plasma displays 
we are working both directly with the manufacturers of these devices and  at the chip level  
table of contents with innovators of new projection and television technologies in an effort to integrate our interactive communication devices with their products and technologies 
a number of the companies expected to have significant offerings in the digital home entertainment market are our customers in our business communications segment 
we believe that our strong relationship with these customers affords us an opportunity to work with them as they expand into this new market and we are actively pursuing these opportunities 
we also make an important component of microsoft s xbox game controller 
this sensor is based on our patented fsr technology and is included in our home entertainment segment because of its application 
in  the majority of our revenue from home entertainment came from sales of the xbox component 
e transactions products 
our standard epad product consists of an fsr touchpad mounted in a plastic case and connected by a serial or usb cable to a computer 
like all of our touchpads  it is actuated using a finger  electronic pen or any other device capable of exerting pressure at a given point on the sensor 
in  we introduced epad ink  an lcd based signature capture product 
the epad products capture and bind signatures to electronic documents 
we work with major electronic signature software application developers to provide turnkey solutions to end users 
depending on the software used with it  the epad device can perform a variety of document authentication functions  such as alerting a reader if any change has been made to a document since it was transmitted by the sender or verifying the authenticity of the signature 
since our introduction of the epad product  we have devoted considerable resources to marketing to the financial services and insurance industries  where we believe there is an obvious opportunity based on cost savings and efficiency 
the sales cycle for larger customers is to months  usually involving an extensive trial and evaluation period 
the poor economic climate for information technology spending in and has severely impacted the industry s ability to gain momentum 
specialty components 
our specialty components business consists primarily of two product lines 
we sell integrated pointing solutions to manufacturers of notebook computers and industrial computers 
we also sell a diverse assortment of custom designed sensors for non computer applications  such as for use in medical devices as safety switches 
this business has been relatively stable for several years  varying only with general economic conditions 
in and the first three quarters of  we received significant royalty revenue from the license of some of our technology to a former affiliate 
the payments ended in the third quarter of and we do not anticipate significant licensing revenue in the future 
technologies force sensing resistors 
our products incorporate one or more fsrs 
a basic fsr sensor can detect and accurately measure a force applied to it  thereby enabling precise control of the process applying the force 
a more complex sensor  known as a four zone sensor  has four sensors arranged in a two by two square with an actuator placed directly where the four sensors touch 
by toggling the actuator in any direction  an operator can control the direction and speed of a cursor on a computer screen 
an fsr sensor can also serve as a touchpad by incorporating a two dimensional grid capable of measuring the location and intensity of pressure applied at any set of coordinates on the grid 
in contrast to most standard touchpads  fsr touchpads can also measure the amount of pressure applied at any point on the grid  thereby creating a three dimensional characterization of input along x  y  and p axes 
this type of device 
table of contents is useful for functions such as handwriting input  where not only the outline of the signature but the pressure applied in writing it can be measured  or computer cursor control  where variable cursor speed is desirable 
our fsr sensors can be as thin as one hundredth of an inch  making them particularly well suited for use where space is a critical issue  as in notebook and sub notebook keyboards 
in touchpad applications  they consume significantly less power than do capacitive touchpads  the principal competing technology 
fsrs are therefore an appropriate choice for wireless applications 
also  unlike capacitive touchpads which react to the electrical capacitance in a human finger  fsrs react to pressure from any object and therefore support pen input 
fsr sensors have no moving parts and can be packaged in a sealed environment 
they are therefore highly reliable  retaining their performance through tens of millions of actuations  even in adverse environments involving heat  moisture  and chemical contamination 
fsr sensors are manufactured using screen printing techniques 
all proprietary aspects of the manufacturing process are conducted in house at interlink to maintain quality and protect the force sensing technology 
while electronic screen printing is a common process in various technology industries  the quality and precision of printing required to make high quality fsr sensors greatly exceeds the standards applicable in most other industries 
we have developed significant expertise in the manufacture of fsr sensors  and believe this experience would be difficult to replicate over the short term 
in the fsr manufacturing process  printed sheets of fsr semiconductor material and the corresponding conductor patterns are laminated to form the fsr sandwich structure using inexpensive sheet adhesives 
the assembled sheets are die cut and suitable connectors are attached 
remotelink 
our remotelink technology uses a proprietary optical carrier design to provide a relatively high speed  multi channel  digital or analog  optical communications link that does not interfere with  or become contaminated by  signals from ir remote controls 
remotelink can be configured to support multiple users and simultaneous channels operating over a number of carrier frequency spectrums  including the to megahertz range 
remotelink s bandwidth supports wireless data transmissions of up to kilobits per second and a kilohertz bandwidth analog transmission at distances of up to meters 
remotelink technology can simultaneously transmit data  voice and legacy ir codes 
remotelink technology s ability to transmit legacy ir codes makes it compatible with existing remote controls 
applications 
we have created a number of applications that allow our hardware technologies to support specific functions 
these applications  for example  enable our fsr based touchpads to support pts mapping and gesture control 
we expect to develop  or work with others to develop  new applications that will allow our intuitive interface devices to control an ever increasing number of interactive functions 
sales and marketing we employ a direct sales team of six people in the us and three in japan 
each sales team is supported by inside sales personnel  product managers and application engineers 
for our branded products  we also use value added resellers  system integrators and distributors throughout the us and europe 
for oem sales  we use public relations activity  direct advertising and trade show participation to 
table of contents generate product awareness 
promising sales leads and known industry targets are followed up with sales visits 
depending on forecast volume and required lead times  we may sell component solutions  ready to integrate modules  complete solutions or totally custom products 
as necessary  application engineers support and visit customers to promote ease of integration 
a successful oem sale will generally take from to months from the initial visit to the first shipment 
however  once obtained  an oem customer usually offers us a more predictable revenue stream 
for branded products  we use public relations  third party product reviews  trade shows and direct advertising to generate customer awareness 
direct sales calls are made to potential distributors and specialty resellers 
once a customer relationship is established  we support these customers with co op advertising  sales spiffs  end user rebates and other promotions 
current distribution channels for our branded products consist of distributors such as ingram micro  catalogs and specialty resellers targeting corporate accounts 
we market to these channels with direct sales through our employees 
in europe we use distributors and specialty resellers 
we use these distribution channels not only to increase branded product sales but also to establish customer demand for new products that generate oem sales 
we anticipate using our relationships with our existing business communication oem customers to facilitate the introduction of our products in the home entertainment market 
we also are forming relationships with software and graphic display microcontroller developers to enhance that market s acceptance of our products and technologies 
we anticipate using similar sales and marketing techniques as those described above once we become established in this market 
for e transactions sales  we use public relations activity  direct advertising and trade show participation to generate product awareness 
promising sales leads and known industry targets are followed up with sales visits 
to a lesser extent  we leverage the sales and marketing resources of our software partners 
manufacturing we manufacture all fsr sensors at our facility in camarillo  california 
this facility is capable of operating on a single  double  or triple shift basis  as volume dictates 
we acquire raw materials and components from a number of sources  mostly within the united states 
we have worked closely with a small group of manufacturers to create new materials optimized for fsr usage  most of which are supplied to us on an exclusive basis 
the raw materials are processed into their final form using proprietary material and methods 
we contract with several manufacturers in china to conduct most of our high volume  non fsr manufacturing operations 
in late  we formed interlink electronics asia pacific ieap  to coordinate our non us manufacturing activities 
based in hong kong  this wholly owned subsidiary purchases components  assembles them into kits and distributes the kits to various contract manufacturers for assembly 
ieap began shipping its first products in february competition we face competition from larger  more established companies that can produce lower cost products using more mature technologies 
many of these companies have greater financial  engineering 
table of contents and manufacturing resources than we do and have long standing customer relationships with key potential customers 
while we believe our technologies are superior  these competitors may develop or acquire enhanced technologies sufficient to maintain or improve their market share 
moreover  competitive pricing pressures on our oem customers products may force them to choose lower cost  less sophisticated solutions from our competitors 
in the business communications market  our competitors include hoshiden corporation and smk corporation 
in the home entertainment and e transactions markets  we face competition from koninklijke philips electronics nv  wacom technology co 
and other smaller companies 
we believe we can continue to compete effectively by continuing to develop patented technologies that increase the functionality of the products of our oem customers 
to maintain our patented technology advantage  we will continue to invest heavily in product and advanced technology development 
by manufacturing most of our non fsr components in countries with lower labor costs  we can continue to offer high volume  low cost solutions 
research and development the business communications  home entertainment and e transactions markets are characterized by rapid and continuous technological development of the systems with which our products interface 
for example  in the business communications market  the computerized projector has rapidly become a powerful  lightweight machine that is easily portable by its user 
to maintain our competitive position  we believe we must develop  in a timely manner  new interface technologies and products and enhance our existing technologies and products 
accordingly  we allocate a significant amount of our financial resources to engineering  product and advanced technology development 
we also maintain close relationships with our customers  which helps us anticipate their product needs 
we employ people in our product design  engineering support and advanced technology departments in the us and in japan 
as appropriate  we engage outside software development firms to facilitate the integration of our products into our customers products 
most of our current research and development efforts are focused on further development of our intellectual property surrounding pad centric input devices and technologies and the wireless communication protocols 
ongoing efforts are directed at enhancing the ergonomics of our interface designs  such as touchpad input and our clicktrigger control 
patents and intellectual property we regularly file patent applications and continuations to cover both new and improved methods of manufacturing fsr sensors and non fsr based technologies 
aspects of our technology are protected by more than patents issued or pending in the united states and abroad  as well as by trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
products incorporating our force sensing technologies are sold under trademarks issued or pending in the united states and various other countries 
us patents covering various materials and processes used in our current generation of products  as well as new devices for angle and displacement sensing  were granted during and our clicktrigger design was afforded patent protection in we have also received us patents and continue to prosecute filed us and foreign patent applications regarding the design  and 
table of contents several key operating features  of our remotelink technology 
the first of the our patents for fsr  which cover certain aspects of the use of an uneven surface to produce variable resistance  expired on september  we have continued our efforts to improve the design  formulation  and manufacture of our sensors 
some of these improvements are maintained as trade secrets  while us and foreign patents have been applied for with respect to others 
the other us and foreign patents we hold at this time  covering various apparatus  processes and methods related to force sensing technology  began expiring last year and the remainder will expire between now and we have also developed certain manufacturing processes and other methods of applying our patented technology that we protect as trade secrets 
we believe these trade secrets are important for the effective and efficient use of the patented technology and that a competitor with a right to use the patented technology would be required to develop comparable manufacturing and other processes to compete effectively 
we require our employees to sign nondisclosure agreements and seek to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent 
we actively enforce our patents 
when a potential infringing company is identified  we first seek to notify the company of our patent rights 
historically  we have been successful in negotiating license arrangements 
if an agreement cannot be reached  we will pursue legal remedies 
while we believe our patents afford some competitive advantage  such protection is limited by the resources available to us to identify potential infringements and to defend our rights against infringement 
the extent of the protection offered by any patent is subject to determinations as to its scope and validity that would be made only in litigation 
we cannot be sure that our patents will afford meaningful protection from competition

table of contents we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
payment of any cash dividends will depend on the results of our operations  our financial condition and our capital expenditure plans  as well as other factors our board of directors may consider relevant 
we presently intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and  therefore  do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a and no 
b 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and require management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
to satisfy the criteria  we input orders based upon receipt of a customer purchase order  record revenue upon shipment of goods or otherwise complying with the terms of the purchase order  confirm pricing through the customer purchase order  and validate creditworthiness through past payment history  credit agency reports and other financial data 
other than through warranty rights  our customers do not have explicit or implicit rights of return 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine the revenue recognition criteria are not met for certain future transactions  such as a determination that an outstanding account receivable has become uncollectible  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable are unsecured  and we are at risk to the extent such amounts become uncollectible 
we continually monitor individual account receivable balances  and provide for an allowance of doubtful accounts at the time collection may become questionable based on payment performance or age of the receivable and other factors related to the customer s ability to pay 
inventory reserve 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of forecast sales levels by product and historical demand 
we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our cost or market value and result in a new cost basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write down may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
provision for income tax 
we first achieved profitable operations in because of net operating loss nol carryforwards available both for our us based and japan based operations  we did not accrue income tax expense until in that year  due to the expiration or full utilization of nol carryforwards in california and japan  we began to record a provision for income tax expense in those jurisdictions 
by the end of  we also began to accrue an income tax benefit related to our federal nol carryforwards to be used in future periods 
however  in mid  we began to record quarterly tax losses and suspended any further recognition of nol carryforward tax benefits 
in fourth quarter   we recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balance as it appears more likely than not that we would be unable to realize it in future periods 

table of contents foreign exchange exposure 
we have established relationships with most of the major oems in the business communications market 
many of these oems are based in japan and approximately and of our and revenues  respectively  came from japanese customers 
revenues from these customers are denominated in japanese yen and as a result we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge this exposure 
the gain or loss from these contracts is recorded in business communications revenue 
in addition  because our japanese subsidiary s functional currency is the yen  the translation of the net assets of that subsidiary into the consolidated results will fluctuate with the yen dollar exchange rate 
the following table illustrates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our yen denominated revenues and the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activity in thousands effect of foreign currency fluctuation on revenues hedging gains net revenue impact historical factors affecting financial performance we were incorporated in california in february and reincorporated in delaware in july our stock was first listed on the nasdaq national market in june  from the inception of the company  we developed and refined our force sensing resistor  or fsr  technology and sold it to customers for electronic  musical  medical  industrial and other applications  which we now refer to as the specialty components market 
this business segment is characterized by customers who have long design cycles and  once a technology is designed  retain that technology for a relatively long period of time 
we expect this segment to experience only limited growth due to the limited resources we can allocate to it 
in  we introduced our first interlink branded computer pointing device  portapoint  and in  we introduced our first wireless pointing device 
the device  called remotepoint  established interlink as a leading supplier of branded and oem remote controls and other products for the computerized presentation system market 
this business segment has been a greatest growth driver over the last five years and  in  constituted of our overall sales 
within the oem element of this segment  we have key customers both in the us and in japan and thus we have been affected by the performance of each of these economies 
despite our dominant oem market share  no one customer constitutes or more of our consolidated sales 
beginning in  we began a renewed effort to expand our branded products product line and our branded products distribution channel 
in  we introduced the electronic signature capture product  epad  for our e transactions market 
since then  we introduced epad point of sale and epad ink 
to date  much of the success in this segment has occurred with large corporate accounts in financial services  insurance and medical industries 
typically these accounts buy  to  units and purchase them all at the initial deployment  consequently revenues in this segment have been relatively variable from quarter to quarter

 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provided guidance on the accounting for business combinations  require all future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method  discontinue amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets  define when and how intangible assets are amortized  and require an annual impairment test for goodwill 
the adoption of these statements in did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on august   the fasb issued no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s results from operations 
the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
and certain sections of apb opinion no 
specific to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
classifies long lived assets as either to be held and used  to be disposed of by other than sale  or to be disposed of by sale 
this standard introduces a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
the company has adopted this statement  which has not had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that an entity review its long lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
interlink does not believe that any such changes have taken place

table of contents incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework

in the fourth quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk our japanese subsidiary  interlink electronics kk  generally makes sales and collects its accounts receivable in japanese yen 
to hedge these revenues against future movements in exchange rates  we purchase foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains or losses on the forward contracts are then offset by gains or losses on the underlying revenue exposure and consequently a sudden or significant change of foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on net income or cash flows to the extent future revenues are protected by forward currency contracts 
these contracts  however  typically have a six month duration 
thus  yen dollar fluctuations lasting more than six months will have an impact on our revenues 
during  we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts in the normal course of business to manage our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on revenues denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and costs associated with financial and global operating activities 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is estimated by obtaining quotes from bankers 
at december   the company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of million 
during fiscal  we recognized  of gains on foreign currency exchange contracts which is reflected in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
based on the company s overall exposure for foreign currency at december   a 
table of contents hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would have no material impact on earnings or cash flows  over a one year period 
interest rate exposure based on our overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical change in interest rates applied to our outstanding debt as of december   would have no material impact on earnings or cash flows  over a one year period
