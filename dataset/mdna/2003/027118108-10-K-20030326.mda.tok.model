item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note b to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
impairment of long lived assets real estate and other long lived assets are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation  unless considered impaired 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired  we will make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows  excluding interest charges  of the property 
in the event the property is under development  the estimate of future cash flows includes all future expenditures necessary to develop the property 
if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate future cash flows  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property 

table of contents real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments 
these factors include changes in the national  regional and local economic climates  local conditions  such as an oversupply of residential land lease properties or a reduction in the demand for our residential land lease properties  and competition from other housing sources including single and multifamily properties  plus changes in market rental rates 
additional factors that may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our development properties include regulatory changes that impact the number of home sites that can be built on our undeveloped land  changes in projected costs to construct new subdivisions in our communities and regulatory changes made by local  regional  state or national authorities 
any adverse changes in these factors could cause impairment in our real estate 
capitalized costs we capitalize direct and indirect costs including interest  real estate taxes  and other costs in connection with the redevelopment  initial capital expenditures  capital enhancements and replacement needs of our owned or controlled properties 
indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities  including general and administrative expenses  are charged to expense as incurred 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of certain development and redevelopment activities and the costs associated with such activities 
as a result  changes in costs and activity may have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
rental property depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for land improvements  to years for buildings and years for furniture and other equipment  all of which are judgmental determinations 
these determinations may prove to be different than the actual life of any individual asset 
inventory carrying amounts for inventory are determined on a specific identification basis and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  if customer preferences change  or if material improvements are made by suppliers that are preferred by our customers over inventory we own  inventory write downs may be required that may have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
our adjustments to write down inventory to its estimated market value totaled  during the year ended december  legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions and the effectiveness of strategies  related to these proceedings 
the amount of loss contingencies involving litigation  for which a loss is probable and which can be reasonably estimated  is determined through consultation with legal counsel representing the company 
our evaluation of loss contingencies arising from litigation  claims and assessments  considers unasserted claims and associated estimates of loss  if any  are provided to the extent probable and reasonably estimable 
see item  legal proceedings 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including their notes in item of this report on form k 
inflation we do not believe that changes in inflation rates would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that since our lease rates are determined annually for a majority of our leased sites  we would be able to recover increases in product and service costs caused by inflation through changes in lease rates 
comparison of to net income we recognized net income of  for the year ended december   compared to net income of  for the year ended december  the following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail 
rental property operations rental and other property revenues from our owned properties totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the total increase consisted of in thousands disposals same store properties total we refer to properties that we owned throughout all of and as same store properties 
this increase in property revenues was a result of  increase in base rental income driven by increases in rental rates and the addition of new leased sites during offset by the sale of a property in december and the sale of three properties in  increase in billings to tenants for metered utility services and property tax expenses   increase in income from the operation of a mini storage facility  all offset by a  decrease in other property income 
property operating expenses from our owned properties totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the increase consisted of in thousands disposals same store properties total 
table of contents the increase in property operating expenses was a result of  increase in salaries and wages   increase in utilities  repairs and maintenance  property taxes and other operating costs   increase in the cost of operating the golf courses at certain properties  offset by  decrease in property management operating overhead 
depreciation expense was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
the reduction was a result of a  decrease associated with the sale of one of our properties in  a  decrease associated with the sale of three properties in  and the change in estimate for useful lives made in the fourth quarter of which resulted in a decrease of  offset by increases of  in depreciable property attributable to the continued development of previously undeveloped home sites 
in  we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation including a property by property analysis accounting for of our capitalized real estate costs 
as a result of this review  we have changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our land improvements and buildings 
prior to october   we computed depreciation using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years for land improvements and buildings and five years for furniture and other equipment 
effective october   we computed depreciation using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for land improvements  to years for buildings and five years for furniture and other equipment 
the effect of this change increased net income after minority interest in the operating partnership for the year ended december   by  or per basic share and per diluted share and for the year ended december   by  per basic and diluted share 
home sales business we reported income from the home sales business of  for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  revenues for the home sales business totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december   with the increase driven by higher unit volumes and a increase in average new home selling prices

table of contents change change revenues cost of sales gross margin gross margin fee income brokerage activities expenses brokerage activities margin on brokerage activities selling marketing costs of revenue new homes sold used homes sold brokered sales average new home sales price average used home sales price the increase in gross margin is attributable to product mix  increased demand at one of our developing communities  reduced sales discounts driven by lower average age of homes sold  and increased supplier rebates due to increased purchasing volume 
selling and marketing expenses in the period increased  from the period primarily as a result of increased commissions associated with increased unit volume of home sales  increased marketing costs for newly constructed subdivisions within existing communities  increased staff levels and an expanded home sales operation serving one community in advance of contracts closing for a new subdivision within the community 
we evaluate our home sales business on the same return on investment basis that we use for acquiring stabilized communities 
for purposes of preparing this analysis  we have excluded the profits of our used home sales and brokerage activities because we would continue to operate the used home sales and brokerage activities independent of our new home sales business 
these are activities that would continue in filled  stabilized communities 
we believe that excluding the benefit of these activities provides a better measure of the income losses attributable to the new home sales business on a proforma basis 
for the years ended december  and  we have made the following analysis year ended december  year ended december  reported income loss used home sales and brokerage business income adjusted income loss for proforma analysis

since our new lease originations are within communities that have stabilized operations  the lower expense ratio is a result of achieving better operating leverage against fixed costs such as common area maintenance including clubhouses and community management personnel 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were  in and  in the  increase in expense was a result of  increase in costs associated with our corporate structure   increase in dividends paid on non vested restricted stock awards that are recorded as compensation expense   increase in cost of umbrella liability coverage   increase in amortization of deferred compensation relating to restricted stock awards   increase in other general administrative expenses   increase in rental expense for office space  all offset by a  reduction in salaries  wages  and benefits and  reduction in franchise tax expense

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled  for the year ended december   compared with equity in income of unconsolidated real estate partnerships of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  during the fourth quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for our investment in unconsolidated real estate partnerships from the cost method to the equity method in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
under the equity method  our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of the unconsolidated real estate partnership for the periods being presented is included in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
the previous method of accounting did not have a materially different result from generally accepted accounting principles 
however  due to increased operating losses  our proportionate share of the net loss has become more material and we have now recorded our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

table of contents general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the  decrease in expense is primarily as a result of the replacement of the cash portion of directors fees with payment in options  reduction in franchise tax expenses due to a lower share base in the period  and elimination of certain duplicate reporting costs 
interest and other income interest and other income was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase in income is primarily a result of the additional income producing financial assets acquired from commercial assets in august  including an interest in commercial mortgage backed securities

during  we did not incur a tax liability 
nol carryover at december   our net operating loss nol carryover was approximately  for the parent reit entity and  for our consolidated taxable reit subsidiaries 
subject to certain limitations  the reit s nol carryover may be used to offset all or a portion of our reit taxable income and to reduce the amount that we are required to distribute to stockholders to maintain our status as a reit 
it does not  however  affect the tax treatment to shareholders of any distributions that we make 
the reit s and the consolidated taxable reit subsidiaries nol carryovers are scheduled to expire between and  and and  respectively 
in the event that relative ownership of the company changes prior to the expiration of the nol  the amount of nol available to the company in any year may be limited 

table of contents dividends and distributions during the year ended december   we distributed  per share to holders of common stock and op units compared to the year ended december  distributions of  per share to holders of common stock and op units and the year ended december  distributions of  per share to holders of common stock and op units 
the tax treatment to shareholders of the dividends paid  if any  is generally determined based upon the character and amount of our taxable income for the relevant year 
for income tax purposes  dividends to common stockholders consist of ordinary income  capital gains including unrecaptured section gain  which is taxable to shareholders who are individuals at a maximum federal rate of  return of capital or a combination thereof 
for the years ended december   and  dividends paid per share were taxable as follows amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage return of capital ordinary income capital gains unrecaptured section gain total our dividend is set quarterly by our board of directors and is subject to change or elimination at any time 
our primary financial objective is to maximize long term  risk adjusted returns on investment for shareholders 
while dividend policy is considered within the context of this objective  maintenance of past dividend levels is not our primary investment objective and is subject to numerous factors including our profitability  capital expenditure plans  obligations related to principal payments and capitalized interest  and the availability of debt and equity capital at terms deemed attractive by us to finance these expenditures 
our nol may be used to offset all or a portion of our reit taxable income  which may allow us to reduce or eliminate our dividends paid and still maintain our reit status 
historically  the combination of dividend payments  capital expenditures  capitalized interest and debt repayment has exceeded funds provided from operating activities and we have funded a portion of these expenditures from debt financings 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so on terms deemed acceptable in the future 
in the event that we are unable to do so or decide not to pursue such financing source  we will be required to reduce or eliminate the dividend  reduce or eliminate capital expenditures  or both 
we initiated a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the plan on may  which allows shareholders to acquire additional shares of common stock by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends paid on our outstanding common stock 
in addition  under the plan  monthly optional cash investments  which are subject to a minimum purchase amount of and a maximum quarterly purchase limit of  per shareholder  are permitted without approval from the board of directors 
optional cash investments in excess of  per shareholder are subject to approval by the board of directors and no such investments were approved during the year ended december  shares may be acquired pursuant to the plan directly from us at a price equal to the average of the daily high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange during the ten trading days prior to the date of the investment  less a possible discount determined by us of up to  generally without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge by the investor

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  our principal activities that demand liquidity include our normal operating activities  payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt  acquisitions of  and additional investments in  properties  and payments of dividends to stockholders and op unitholders 
we expect to utilize cash provided by operating activities and short term borrowings to meet short term liquidity demands 
the available credit under our line of credit totaled  however  the continued availability of these funds is subject to certain borrowing base restrictions and other customary restrictions  including continuing compliance with financial and other covenants 
based upon the application of these covenants as of december   the entire undrawn commitment of  was available 
at december   the availability under our floor plan totaled  that can be used to acquire additional amounts of qualified inventory 
in the event that cash provided by operating activities is reduced or if access to short term borrowing sources becomes restricted  we will be required to reduce or eliminate expenditures for the continued development of our communities and or reduce our dividend 
we expect to meet our liquidity requirements in excess of months through a variety of sources including cash generated by operations  long term and short term secured and unsecured borrowings  and the issuance of equity securities 
our ability to access secured and unsecured borrowings as a source of liquidity is dependent upon factors outside of our control including economic trends that impact the availability of credit from lending sources we currently utilize 
our ability to issue additional equity securities including the issuance by the operating partnership of op units and other units in the operating partnership is dependent upon factors outside of our control including returns available on alternative investments and other economic factors 
the extent of cash generated by our operations is dependent upon our ability to operate the existing portfolio of revenue earning sites at margins comparable to past results and to originate new earning sites through new lease originations generated by our home sales business 
our ability to generate cash through the operation of the current portfolio is dependent upon our ability to acquire the goods and services required to operate the portfolio at costs that increase no faster than increases realized in revenues  the continued absence of natural disasters  such as hurricanes  that would disrupt the flow of rental income for an undeterminable time period  and other factors 
our ability to generate cash through the origination of new earning sites is dependent upon our ability to market effectively to our target customers  to originate contracts for sale of homes at our properties  thereby generating income producing leases and to develop the undeveloped land within our portfolio in a timely fashion  on a cost effective basis  and as warranted by home sales 
operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the million increase was primarily the result of million increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities  million increase in earnings before depreciation  amortization  minority interest  equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships  and loss gain on sale of discontinued operations 

table of contents investing activities in  the net cash used in investing activities was million  compared with net cash provided of million in the million decrease in net cash was due to million decrease in proceeds related to the sale of real estate in as compared to  million in additional expenditures for capital replacements  improvements and capitalized interest in as compared to  primarily related to the continued development of unleased sites  million in decreased collections on cmbs bonds for as compared to  million decrease in proceeds from notes receivable  offset by million increase as the result of the acquisition of a minority interest in consolidated real estate in  million increase as the result of real estate purchased in  which did not recur in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared with in which million was used by financing activities

we have a revolving line of credit with a bank with a total commitment of  that bears interest at the bank s reference rate at december  
the line of credit is secured by real property and improvements located in st 
lucie county  florida and maricopa county  arizona with a net book value of  the revolving line of credit matures in may at december    was outstanding and  was not drawn under the revolving line of credit 
the availability of funds to us under the line of credit is subject to certain borrowing base restrictions and other customary restrictions  including compliance with financial and other covenants there under 
based upon the application of these covenants as of december   the entire undrawn commitment of  was available 
we have a floor plan line of credit with a floor plan lender providing a credit facility of  with a variable interest rate linked to the prime rate and spreads varying from to  depending on the 
table of contents manufacturer and age of the inventory 
individual advances mature as early as days or have no stated maturity  based upon the manufacturer 
amounts outstanding are nonrecourse to us for the period of time the financed home is subject to a repurchase agreement with the manufacturer of the home 
this floor plan line of credit is secured by inventory located in our residential land lease communities with a carrying value of approximately  at december    was outstanding and  was available under the floor plan credit facility to acquire additional amounts of qualified inventory 
on march   our former floor plan lender notified us of its election to exit the floor plan lending business nationwide 
this recourse floor plan line of credit bears interest at the lender s prime rate plus amounts ranging from to based upon the manufacturer and age of the inventory 
our obligations existing as of december  will mature the earlier of the date of sale of a home financed pursuant to the floor plan or april this floor plan line of credit is secured by inventory located in our residential land lease communities with a carrying value of approximately  at december    was outstanding under this floor plan credit facility 
as of december   of the carrying value of our real estate and of the carrying value of our total assets were encumbered by debt 
we had total outstanding indebtedness of million  all of which was secured by various residential land lease communities or inventory situated therein 
of our indebtedness  million  or  was secured long term notes payable and million  or  was secured short term financing 
the weighted average effective interest rate on our secured long term notes payable was at december  the weighted average interest rate on our secured short term financing was at december  our secured long term notes payable had a weighted average maturity of years at december  funds from operations we measure our economic profitability based on funds from operations  or ffo  less annual capital replacement spending for developed homesites 
for the year ended december   our capital replacement spending averaged per developed homesite 
we believe that the presentation of ffo  when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  provides a useful measure of our performance 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our basis for computing ffo is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts also known as nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains and losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciable real estate property  net of related income taxes  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo beginning with the nareit definition as further adjusted for the minority interest in the operating partnership owned by persons other than us and amortization of intangibles such as management contracts 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides investors with measurements that help facilitate an understanding of our ability to make required dividend payments  capital expenditures and principal payments on our debt 
since ffo excludes depreciation and other real estate related expenses  ffo may be materially different from net income 
therefore  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net 
table of contents income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indication of our operating performance or liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions  since ffo does not consider recurring capital expenditures  principal maturities or other capital expenditure commitments of the company 
we use ffo in measuring our operating performance because we believe that the items that result in a difference between ffo and net income do not impact the ongoing operating performance of a real estate company 
also  we believe other real estate companies  analysts and investors utilize ffo in analyzing the results of real estate companies 
our basis of computing ffo is not necessarily comparable with that of other reits 
for   and  our ffo was as follows in thousands net income minority interest in operating partnership real estate depreciation amortization of management contracts federal income tax attributed to constructive sale of properties equity in commercial assets adjustments for ffo nonrecurring income  net discontinued operations real estate depreciation minority interest in operating partnership attributed to discontinued operations loss gain on sale of property  net of minority interest in operating partnership depreciation from unconsolidated real estate partnerships funds from operations ffo weighted average common shares and op units outstanding for   and  our net cash flows were as follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities off balance sheet arrangements we own general partnership interests in two unconsolidated real estate partnerships  which interests were acquired through acquisitions and direct interests 
our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships range from to 
however  based on the provisions of the related partnership agreements  which grant varying degrees of control  we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes 
there are no undisclosed lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees  or any other financial instruments
