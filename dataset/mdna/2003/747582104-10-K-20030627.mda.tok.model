on an on going basis  the company evaluates estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivable  and intangible assets  for reasonableness 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources

the company believes that significant accounting policies  as described in note of its consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
the company s revenues are primarily generated from the sale of software licenses  maintenance fees  and edi services 
revenue recognition is governed by statement of position sop as amended by sop inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management estimates and judgments  which influence the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
in accordance with the governing revenue recognition guidelines  if the arrangement between vendor and purchaser does not require significant production  modification  or customization of software  revenue should be recognized when all of the following criteria are met o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  o delivery has occurred  o the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable  and o collectibility is probable 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the recognition of software license revenues is based on the company s assessment that the above criteria have been met 
in general  the first two criteria are met with a signed contract and evidence that the company has shipped its software to the customer 
the company determines that its fee is fixed and determinable based on the contract terms  which specify payment terms tied to specific dates and not to any future deliverables 
probability of collection is based on a credit review of customers 
the timing or amount of revenue recognition can differ if different assessments of the above listed criteria had been made at the time transactions were recorded in revenue 
sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of each of those elements 
the fair value of each element must be based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
when evidence of fair value exists for the delivered and undelivered elements of a transaction  then discounts for individual elements are aggregated and the total discount is allocated to the individual elements in proportion to the element s fair value relative to the total contract fair value 
when evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements only  the residual method  provided for under sop  is used 
under the residual method  the company defers revenue related to the undelivered elements in a system sale based on vendor specific objective evidence of each element s fair value and allocates the remainder of the contract price  net of all discounts  to revenue recognized from the delivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is determined by the average sales price of the element when sold separately 
management estimates used in the calculation of vendor specific objective evidence include the average renewal rates for support services and the average price of implementation and training services and interfaces sold on a stand alone basis 
valuation allowances 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the valuation allowance is based on interpretation of client specific credit information and payment history as well as an aggregated review of the company s accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill impairment 
the company s long lived assets include goodwill of million as of march  and  respectively 
the company adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas effective april  the new statement applies to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has ceased amortizing amounts related to goodwill starting april  the balance of goodwill is related to the company s nextgen division 
the company has compared the fair value of the nextgen division with the carrying amount of assets associated with the division and determined that none of the goodwill recorded as of june  was impaired 
the fair value of the nextgen division was determined using a reasonable estimate of future cash flows of the division and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the company s business segments 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about the company s strategic plans with regard to operations 
to the extent additional information arises or the strategies of the company change  it is possible that the company s conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on its financial position or results of operations
