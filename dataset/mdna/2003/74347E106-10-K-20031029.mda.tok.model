additional factors that may affect results of operations and market price of stock this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than historical or current facts  including  without limitation  statements about our business strategy  plans and objectives of management and our future prospects  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that these statements are reasonable in view of the facts available to us  no assurance can be given that all of these statements will prove to be accurate 
numerous factors could have a material effect upon whether these projections could be realized or whether these trends will continue 
among these factors are those set forth in the following section  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
factors affecting liquidity we are operating with limited cash resources 
based on our current activity and expectations we have sufficient cash resources for at least the next twelve months of operations 
though we are profitable currently  a moderate change to our revenue generating capability or our expense structure could result in operating losses 
losses  if any  would erode our liquidity by further reducing cash resources 
should we need to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain them on terms satisfactory to us 
if we could not raise additional funds on terms satisfactory to us  we would be forced to raise funds on terms that we would not otherwise accept or seek funds through other means such as the sale of some or all of our assets or operations 
the company s board of directors engaged an investment banker in july to explore strategic options for the company  including a sale of some or all of its assets and operations 
we were involved in a number of discussions as the result of this engagement  none of which led to a material transaction 
should we need to raise capital for liquidity purposes through the sale of some or all of our assets or operation  there can be no assurances that any future discussions would result in an acceptable transaction 
potential delisting from the nasdaq stock market on october   the trading of our common stock was transferred from the nasdaq national market system to the nasdaq smallcap market as a result of our failure to satisfy the minimum bid price per share requirement set forth in the nasdaq market place rules 
however  in order to remain on the nasdaq smallcap market  the company must satisfy the bid price requirement by having a closing bid price of our common stock of at least for a minimum of ten consecutive days  which we have not done to date 
on 
table of contents 
index to financial statements november   nasdaq notified us that we had until may  to regain compliance with the bid price requirement 
on march   the sec declared effective nasdaq s rule which extended compliance periods by an additional days for issuers meeting certain more stringent financial criteria 
on may   nasdaq notified us that we had qualified for the additional grace period and therefore had until august  to regain compliance 
on august   nasdaq notified us that as a result of our failure to satisfy the bid price requirement at the expiration of the grace period  the company s securities were immediately subject to delisting 
on august  the company requested a hearing  which stayed the delisting 
on october   nasdaq notified the company that it had granted the company an exception to the bid price requirement through december   to allow for further developments in the sec rule making process regarding nasdaq s proposal to the sec for modifications to its bid price rules 
under the nasdaq proposal to the sec  the company could be eligible for an additional compliance period through no later than may  if we do not comply by december  and the sec does not approve nasdaq s proposal  nasdaq has indicated it will provide us with written notification that our securities will be delisted 
if nasdaq delists our common stock  then our common stock may be traded on the otc bulletin board or the pink sheets 
many institutional and other investors refuse to invest in stocks that are traded at levels below the nasdaq markets  which could reduce the trading liquidity in our common stock or make our effort to raise capital more difficult 
otc bulletin board and pink sheets stocks are often lightly traded or not traded at all on any given day 
any reduction in trading liquidity or active interest on the part of the investors in our common stock could have adverse consequences on our stockholders  either because of reduced market prices or lack of a regular  active trading market for our common stock 
possibility of future losses the company has incurred net losses of approximately million from inception through july  though our operations are currently profitable  our ability to generate revenue growth in the future is subject to uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues  manage expenses  or maintain profitability 
should revenue decrease in the future  we may not be able to stem losses thereafter through expense reductions  given the magnitude of the reductions already implemented 
intense competition in training market we face substantial competition in the education and training market 
competition in the ict training market is intense and is affected by the rapidly evolving nature of the information technology industry 
a number of other companies offer products and services similar to ours  and additional new competitors may emerge in the future 
many of our existing competitors have substantially greater capital resources  technical expertise  marketing experience  research and development status  established customers and facilities than do we 
as a result  there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully compete with existing and future competitors  which would adversely affect our financial performance 
need to respond to rapid technological changes in our industry  technology advances rapidly and industry standards change frequently 
to remain competitive and improve profitability  we must continually enhance our existing products and promptly introduce new products  services  and technologies to meet the changing demands of our customers 
our failure to respond to technological changes quickly would adversely affect our financial performance 
volatility of stock price our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  which may continue in the future 
additionally  the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition to such broad market fluctuations  factors 
table of contents 
index to financial statements such as  but not limited to  the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market fluctuations in our operating results the perception by others of our ability to obtain any necessary new financing a limited trading market for our common stock announcements of new ventures or products and services by us or our competitors item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
a portion of our cash flows is expected to be received in non us currencies 
in addition  a portion of our assets is held in foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar 
such exposure is not significant relative to our overall operations and we believe that the risk associated with our exposure will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations
