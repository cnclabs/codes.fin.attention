item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting disclosure amounts inthousands  except per share data the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
management has made estimates in the past that we believed to be appropriate but were subsequently revised to reflect actual experience 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if o it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and o changes in the estimate or different estimated amounts that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
policy reserves and policy and contract claim liabilities our policies are accounted for as long duration policies 
as a result there are two components to the liabilities associated with our policies 
the first is a liability for future policyholder benefits  represented by the present value of future benefits less future premium collections 
in calculating these reserves we utilize assumptions  including estimates for persistency  morbidity claims expectations  mortality  interest rates  and premium rate increases 
these assumptions are estimated in the year a policy is issued 
once the assumptions are established we continue to utilize those assumptions unless our assessment of deferred acquisition costs indicates that the present value of anticipated future premiums less future costs plus current reserves is less than current unamortized dac 
any variance from the assumptions established in the year a policy is issued could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the second reserve we establish is for incurred  either reported or not yet reported  policy and contract claims 
this amount represents the benefits for our current claims 
the significant assumptions utilized in establishing the policy and contract claims are expectations about the duration and incidence of claims and the interest rate utilized to discount the claim reserves 
these assumptions are based on our past experience  industry experience and current trends 
as part of our monitoring of policy and contract claims we compare actual results to our expectations 
any deviations from our expectations are recorded in the year in which the deviation occurs 
during we increased our policy and contract claim reserves by  based on new assumptions that have been applied to both claims incurred during and to claims incurred prior to any changes in our estimates in the future may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
dac recoverability we regularly assess the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of anticipated future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than the current unamortized dac then the dac is deemed recoverable 
the dac recoverability analysis includes assumptions for persistency  morbidity claims expectations  interest rates  and premium rate increases 
the recoverability of our dac is dependent upon the assumption of future rate increases 
long term care insurance has fixed annual premiums that can be adjusted only upon approval of the insurance departments of the states where the premiums were written 
the adjustment of these fixed annual premium rates is referred to as rate increases 
the process for filing for rate increases requires the company to demonstrate to the insurance department that expected claims experience is anticipated to exceed original assumptions 
the approval of rate increases is at the discretion of the insurance department 
over the past two years  we have had success in obtaining rate increases for a majority of our products 
however  we have a continuing need to obtain rate increases on the remaining products that have not yet received rate increases and  in certain cases  additional rate increases on products where we have already received rate increases 
there has been increased public and regulatory scrutiny over the practice of obtaining rate increases on long term care insurance 
we base our rate increase assumptions on our past experience and our expectations of the amounts of actual rate increases that we will be able to achieve 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the assumed level of rate increases  we could recognize an impairment in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
litigation and contingencies we are involved in lawsuits relating to our operations 
these lawsuits include  but are not limited to  allegations as to improper sales practices in connection with the recent rate increases on our long term care policies 
we are also involved in a dispute with one of our reinsurers over an alleged breach of contract by the company as a result of the company entering into the centre reinsurance agreement without obtaining prior written approval of the reinsurer 
we recognize an estimated loss for contingencies when we believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation and contingency matters 
as time passes and additional facts and circumstances become known  our estimation of the probability of loss as well as our ability to reasonably estimate a loss will change 
the ultimate outcome of litigation and other contingencies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position in the future 
deposit accounting for centre reinsurance agreement the centre reinsurance agreement is being accounted for utilizing deposit accounting for reinsurance contracts 
we are using deposit accounting because we believe the reinsurance contract does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer will suffer a significant loss 
we assessed this long duration reinsurance contract using the reasonable possibility of significant loss criteria due to certain contract provisions that limit the risk to the reinsurer  including an aggregate limit of liability for the reinsurer  experience refund provisions  and expense and risk charges provided to the reinsurer 
we also entered into the reinsurance agreement with the intent of commuting the agreement at december   which further supports the use of deposit accounting 
we have established the accounting model for this reinsurance agreement assuming that we will commute the contract on december   the first available commutation date 
we intend  but are not required  to commute the agreement on december  we have significant incentive to commute the agreement on december  as the expense and risk charges applied to the experience account for the benefit of the reinsurer begin to escalate after december  and the reinsurer may exercise warrants at a common stock equivalent price of per share  representing approximately of the then outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
our current actuarial modeling and projections indicate that it is likely that we will be able to commute the agreement  as planned  on december  in order to commute the agreement  ptna s and anic s our pennsylvania insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus following commutation must be sufficient to support the reacquired business in accordance with statutory capital requirements 
upon commutation  we will receive cash or other liquid assets equalling the value of the experience account 
for statutory reporting purposes  we will also record the statutory basis policy reserves and policy and contract claim liabilities in our statutory financial statements 
accordingly  the company s ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the value of the experience account exceeding the level of required statutory basis policy reserves on december  as of december   the statutory basis policy reserves and policy and contract claim liabilities of  exceed the value of the experience account of  we expect that the growth in the experience account will exceed the growth in the policy reserve and policy and contract claim liabilities  such that the experience account value will exceed the policy and contract claim liabilities at december  our ability to commute is dependent upon our assumptions regarding the future performance of the underlying insurance policies from now until december  additionally  the experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the value of the experience account by approximately  and jeopardize the company s ability to commute as planned 
we cannot anticipate future increases or decreases in market interest rates 
as a result of our intention to commute on december   we assessed only estimated expense and risk charges prior to december  in our most recent dac recoverability analyses 
we have not included any of the escalating expense and risk charges beyond december  in addition  as part of the consideration for the agreement  we provided the reinsurer with warrants valued at approximately  this consideration is being recognized over the anticipated life of the contract 
in the event we determine that commutation of the reinsurance contract is unlikely on december   but likely at some future date  we would include the additional annual expense and risk charges in our dac recoverability analysis 
this would most likely result in an additional impairment of our dac 
the amount of the impairment would be dependent on the number of additional years beyond december  until commutation as well as our best estimate of the other assumptions utilized in the dac impairment calculation morbidity  mortality  interest rates  premium rate increases  and withdrawls at the date the analysis is performed 
experience account our centre reinsurance agreement includes a provision for the maintenance of an experience account for our benefit in the event we elect to  and are able to  commute the reinsurance agreement in the future 
the experience account balances was  as of december  we receive a return on the experience account that is based on a series on benchmark indices and derivative hedges 
the benchmark indices are comprised on us treasury strips  agencies  and investment grade corporate bonds with weightings of approximately  and  respectively and a duration of approximately years 
we believe the return on the notional experience account represents a hybrid instrument  containing both a fixed debt host and an embedded derivative  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we are accounting for the investment return on the experience account as follows o the fixed debt host yields a fixed return based on the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices 
the fixed debt host is reported as investment income in the statement of operations 
o the change in fair value of the embedded derivative  represented by the percentage change in the underlying indices applied to the notional experience account  is similar to that of an unrealized gain or loss on a bond 
the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative is reported as a market gain or loss on experience account in the statement of operations 
our conclusion that the return on the notional experience account represents a hybrid instrument with an embedded derivative is based on our belief that the economic characteristics and risk of the fixed debt host contract are not clearly and closely related to those of the embedded derivative 
when we determine the yield on the fixed debt host and the value of the embedded derivate  we reconcile these amounts to the amount credited to the experience account by the reinsurer  as we believe the actual return credited by the reinsurer should equal the sum of the amounts recognized in our statement of operations 
goodwill at december   the balance of our goodwill was  effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of sfas resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization  the allocation of the goodwill to reporting units  and the establishment of an annual impairment test based on the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill has been allocated 
different valuation methods and assumptions can produce significantly different results  which could affect the amount of any goodwill impairment charge 
we have identified two reporting units agency operations and insurance operations as defined in sfas the goodwill was allocated between the two reporting units as follows agency operations and insurance operations our impairment analysis involved an assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
upon completion of the analysis  we determined that the goodwill associated with the agency operations was fully recoverable and that the goodwill allocated to the insurance operations was impaired 
as a result  we recognized an impairment loss of approximately which has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the agency valuation assumed  among other things  future growth in our agency business that is consistent with our growth in the past 
in the event that our actual growth and profitability does not meet our expectations  we may realize a goodwill impairment in the future 
overview amounts in thousands  except per share data our principal products are individual  defined benefit accident and health insurance policies that consist of nursing home care  home health care  medicare supplement  life and long term disability insurance 
we experienced significant reductions in new premium sales during and due to the cessation of new business generation in all states and as a result of market concerns regarding our insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus 
under our corrective action plan the plan  which was approved by the pennsylvania insurance department the department in february  we recommenced sales in certain states  but intend to limit new business growth to levels that will allow us to maintain sufficient statutory surplus 
our underwriting practices rely upon the base of experience that we have developed in over years of providing nursing home care insurance  as well as upon available industry and actuarial information 
as the home health care market has developed  we have encouraged our customers to purchase both nursing home and home health care coverage  thus providing our policyholders with enhanced protection and broadening our policy base 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the states in which they are licensed to write insurance 
these laws and regulations govern matters such as payment of dividends  settlement of claims  and loss ratios 
state regulatory authorities must approve premiums charged for insurance products 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are required to establish and maintain reserves with respect to reported and incurred but not reported claims  as well as estimated future benefits payable under our insurance policies 
these reserves must  at a minimum  comply with mandated standards 
our reserves are certified annually by our consulting actuary as to standards required by the insurance departments for our domiciliary state and for the other states in which we conduct business 
we believe we maintained adequate reserves as mandated by each state in which we are currently writing business at december  our results of operations are affected significantly by the following other factors level of required reserves for policies in force 
our insurance policies are accounted for as sfas long duration contracts 
as a result  there are two components of policyholder liabilities 
the first is a policy reserve liability as required by sfas for future policyholder benefits  represented by the present value of future benefits less future premium collection 
these reserves are calculated based on assumptions that include estimates for mortality  morbidity  interest rates  premium rate increases and policy persistency 
the assumptions are consistent with industry experience and historical results  as modified for our own experience 
the second is a reserve for incurred  either reported or not yet reported  policy and contract claims  which represents the benefits for current claims 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating statistical information with respect to the number and nature of historical claims 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust our reserves on the basis of such comparisons to the extent that our analysis suggests that adverse development is likely to continue in future periods 
additions to  or reductions in  reserves are recognized in our current consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as expense or income  respectively  through benefits to policyholders and are a material component of our net income or loss 
a portion of premium collected in each period is set aside to establish reserves for future policy benefits 
establishing reserves is based upon current assumptions and we cannot assure you that actual claims expense will not differ materially from the claims expense anticipated by the assumptions used in the establishment of reserves 
any variance from these assumptions could affect our profitability in future periods 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
in connection with the sale of our insurance policies  we defer and amortize a portion of the policy acquisition costs over the related premium paying periods of the life of the policy 
these costs include all expenses that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of the policy  including commissions  underwriting and other policy issue expenses 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac is determined using the same projected actuarial assumptions used in computing policy reserves 
dac can be affected by unanticipated terminations of policies because  upon such terminations  we are required to expense fully the dac associated with the terminated policies 
in addition  the assumptions underlying dac and our policy benefit reserves are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect current assumptions 
whenever we determine that our dac is not fully recoverable  we impair the carrying value of our dac through an expense to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
policy premium levels 
we attempt to set premium levels to maximize profitability 
premium levels on new products  as well as rate increases on existing products  are subject to government review and regulation 
investment income and experience account 
our investment portfolio  excluding our notional experience account  consists primarily of investment grade fixed income securities 
income generated from this portfolio is largely dependent upon prevailing levels of interest rates 
due to the duration of our investments approximately years  investment income does not immediately reflect changes in market interest rates 
in connection with our reinsurance agreement with centre  we transferred substantially all of our investment portfolio to the reinsurer as the initial premium payment 
the initial and future premium for the reinsured policies  less claims payments  ceding commissions and risk charges is credited to a notional experience account  the balance of which also receives an investment credit 
the notional experience account balance represents an amount to be paid to us in the event of commutation of the agreement 
based on our analysis of sfas  we believe that the experience account represents a hybrid instrument  containing both a fixed debt host contract and an embedded derivative 
the fixed debt host yields a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices 
the return on the fixed debt host is reported as investment income in the statement of operations 
the change in fair value of the embedded derivative represents the percentage change in the underlying indices applied to the notional experience account  similar to that of an unrealized gain loss on a bond 
the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative is reported as market gain on experience account in the statement of operations 
as a result  our results of operations are subject to significant volatility 
recorded market value gains or losses  although recognized in current earnings  are expected to be offset in future periods from the receipt of the most recent market rates for all subsequent periods 
the benchmark indices are comprised of us treasury strips  agencies and investment grade corporate bonds  with weightings of approximately  and  respectively  and have a duration of approximately years 
lapsation and persistency 
factors that affect our results of operations include lapsation and persistency  both of which relate to the renewal of insurance policies 
lapsation is the termination of a policy by non renewal 
lapsation is automatic if and when premiums become more than days overdue although  in some cases  a lapsed policy may be reinstated within six months 
persistency represents the percentage of premiums renewed  which we calculate by dividing the total annual premiums at the end of each year less first year premiums for that year by the total annual premiums in force for the prior year 
for purposes of this calculation  a decrease in total annual premiums in force at the end of any year would be the result of non renewal of policies  including policies that have terminated by reason of death  lapsed due to nonpayment of premiums and or been converted to other policies we offered 
first year premiums are premiums covering the first twelve months a policy is in force 
renewal premiums are premiums covering all subsequent periods 
policies renew or lapse for a variety of reasons 
we believe that our efforts to address policyholder concerns or questions help to ensure policy renewals 
we work closely with our licensed agents  who play an integral role in policy persistency and policyholder communication 
economic cycles can influence a policyholder s ability to continue the payment of insurance premiums when due 
we believe that publicity regarding newly enacted federal and state tax legislation allowing medical deductions for certain long term care insurance premiums has raised public awareness of the escalating costs of long term care and the value provided to the consumer of long term care insurance 
the ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries by independent rating agencies also influence consumer decisions 
lapsation and persistency can both positively and adversely affect future earnings 
reduced lapsation and higher persistency generally result in higher renewal premiums and lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs  but may lead to increased claims in future periods 
higher lapsation can result in reduced premium collection  a greater percentage of higher risk policyholders  and accelerated expensing of deferred acquisition costs 
however  higher lapsation may also lead to decreased claims in future periods 
results of operations twelve months ended december  and amounts in thousands premiums 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve months ended december  the period  including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  decreased to  compared to  in the same period in the period 
total first year premiums earned in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
first year long term care premiums earned in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
we experienced significant reductions in new premium sales due to the cessation of new business generation in all states and due to continued market concerns regarding our insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus 
under our plan  which was approved by the department in the first quarter  we recommenced sales in certain states  but intend to limit new business growth to levels that will allow us to maintain sufficient statutory surplus 
see liquidity and capital resources 
effective september   we determined to discontinue the sale nationally of all new long term care insurance policies until the plan was completed and approved by the department 
this decision resulted from our concern about further depletion of statutory surplus from new policy sales prior to the completion and approval of the plan and from increasing concern with respect to the status of the plan expressed by many states in which the company is licensed to conduct business 
upon the department s approval of the plan in february  we recommenced new policy sales in states  including pennsylvania 
we have now recommenced new policy sales in additional states  including florida  virginia and texas  which have historically represented approximately  and of our new policy sales  respectively 
we are actively working with the remaining states to recommence new policy sales in all jurisdictions 
we have recently agreed upon terms for the recommencement of sales in california  which is pending subject to certain conditions 
california has historically represented approximately of our new policy sales 
total renewal premiums earned in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
renewal long term care premiums earned in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
the majority of this increase resulted from the receipt of increased revenue following the implementation of premium rate increases averaging approximately on of our policies in force 
we may experience reduced renewal premiums if policies lapse  especially given our recent premium rate increases 
persistency decreased from in the period to in the period 
current declines in first year premiums  as discussed above  will negatively impact future renewal premium growth as well 
net investment income 
net investment income earned for the period increased to  from  for the period 
as a result of our new reinsurance agreement  substantially all of our investable assets from business written prior to december   were transferred to the reinsurer 
the reinsurer maintains a notional experience account on our behalf in the event that the reinsurance agreement is later commuted 
as discussed above in overview  the notional experience account is credited with an investment credit equal to the most recent yield to maturity of a series of benchmark indices and hedges  which are designed to closely match the duration of our liabilities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was and  respectively  in the and periods 
although market rates have declined  the higher yield in the period resulted from a significant change in our portfolio 
in  primarily all of our investment income is derived from the investment credit attributable to the fixed debt host component of our experience account return  which has a duration of approximately years and correspondingly  a higher yield 
in  we held a portfolio of bonds with a duration of approximately years and common stocks 
the investment income component of our experience account investment credit generated  in the period  with an average yield of 
the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was and for and  respectively 
the total return on our experience account  which comprises the majority of our investible assets was in the period and the total return of our fixed income portfolio in was 
management attributes the favorable return achieved from its experience account in to a longer duration of the underlying benchmark indices  which were positively impacted by declining market interest rates during the performance of our portfolio in  which did not include an experience account  was similar to the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index 
net realized capital gains and trading account activity 
during the period  we recognized capital gains of  compared to capital losses of  in the period 
we accounted for the transfer of the securities portion of the initial premium payment for our new reinsurance agreement as a sale of these assets 
substantially all of the recognized capital gains in the period resulted from the transfer of the initial premium of approximately  to the reinsurer 
the results in the period were recorded primarily due to the impairment of all unrealized losses in our investment portfolio as other than temporary declines 
this determination resulted from our decision to transfer substantially all of our investable assets to the reinsurer  which would prevent the future recovery of these unrealized losses 
during the period  we classified our convertible bond portfolio as trading account investments 
changes in trading account investment market values were recorded in our statement of operations during the period in which the change occurred  rather than as an unrealized gain or loss recorded directly through equity 
as a result  we recorded a trading account loss in the period of  which reflected the unrealized and realized loss of our convertible portfolio that arose during that period 
no investments were classified as trading during the period 
market gain loss on experience account 
we recorded a market gain on our experience account balance of  in the period 
as discussed in overview and net investment income above  the reinsurer maintains a notional experience account for our benefit in the event of future recapture 
the notional experience account receives an investment credit based upon the total return of a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges  which are designed to closely match the duration of our reserve liabilities 
periodic changes in the market values of the benchmark indices and derivative hedges are recorded in our financial statements as a realized gain or loss in the period in which they occur 
as a result  our future financial statements are subject to significant volatility see item a disclosures about market risk 
other income 
we recorded  in other income during the period  up from  in the period 
the increase is attributable primarily to the recognition of a deferred gain from the sale of our disability business in the period 
the sale was done as a quota share agreement  in contemplation of a subsequent assumption of the business  where actual ownership of the policies would change 
in the period  approximately of the policies were assumed and we recorded approximately  as other income 
benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in the period increased to  compared to  in the period 
our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in the period  compared to in the period 
as discussed in overview above  we establish reserves for current claims based upon current and historical experience of our policyholder benefits  including an expectation of claims incidence and duration  as well as the establishment of a reserve for claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported ibnr 
we continuously monitor our experience to determine the best estimate of reserves to be held for future payments of these claims 
as a result  we periodically refine our process to incorporate the most recent known information in establishing these reserves 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
this amount of  and  in and  respectively  from prior year end reserve balances plus adjustments to reflect actual versus estimated claims experience 
these adjustments particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
the adjustments to reserves for claims incurred in prior periods are primarily attributable to claims incurred from our long term care insurance policies  which represent approximately of our premium in force 
to estimate reserves for future claims payments more precisely  we have refined our assumptions and processes for developing these reserves 
during the third quarter  we completed an analysis of the adverse deviation recognized in the past development of our reserves for current claims 
as a result of this analysis  our actuarial modeling suggested that future claim payments would likely exceed our past assumptions  which  if unaddressed  could continue to cause future adverse deviation 
as a result  we have made two modifications to our process for developing claims reserves a redefinition of claims over the past years  our percentage of policies in force offering benefits for both nursing facility and in home health care coverage has increased 
we have recorded claims that begin in one type of care and later move to another type of care as two separate claims 
defining claims in this manner has projected a greater number of expected claims from certain types of policies  as well as a shorter expected length of individual claims 
we have now determined to define this as one claim  using the earliest date of service as the incurral date 
this redefinition of claims results in fewer expected future claims  but anticipates that each claim will last longer 
b continuance assumptions once a claim occurs  we develop claim reserves by using continuance tables  which measure the likelihood of a claim continuing in the future 
historically  we have applied every claim to a set of uniform continuance tables 
our actuarial modeling suggests that this assumption and process no longer reflects the increasing number of claims from policies with longer benefit periods or increased benefit amounts 
we have refined our assumptions and processes by creating separate continuance patterns for facility  home health and comprehensive care  as well as for tax qualified and non qualified plans 
in addition  we have established separate continuance tables for claims caused by cognitive impairment 
as a result  we believe that the duration of existing claims will be longer than was previously expected and have adopted this assumption and process change 
by redefining these multiple claims as a single claim and by employing new assumptions and processes for predicting the continuance of claims  we are confident that we can predict future claims development with a much higher degree of precision 
by identifying trends earlier  we would have seen substantially less adverse deviation from expected results in the development of claims reserves 
we believe that the new assumptions will serve to reduce future reserve volatility by more closely predicting future claims development 
as a result of this redefinition of claims and employment of new continuance tables for separate types of claims  we increased our policy and contract claims by  in the third quarter of  which is primarily attributable to claims incurred prior to january  the new continuance tables have been applied to all claims in the determination of our claims reserves at december  we expect to continue the evaluation of these continuance tables in the future  making adjustments to our expectations as further experience develops and is analyzed 
our process to determine new continuance tables included the evaluation of historical claims payments and duration 
during our review  we recognized that our claims experience had deteriorated in and  and was improving during the latter part of and further examination in the fourth quarter of indicated that several changes that we employed in our claims management process have impacted the recent results of our claims and are expected to improve our results in the future 
these changes include new underwriting protocols  further development of our internal care management staff  which enables all new claims to be screened by nurses that are able to assist the claimant in the development of a proper plan of care  more experienced claim staff that are better able to adjudicate new and exisiting claims  and the use of hospital and home health care provider networks that offer discounted pricing for claimants using their services 
in addition  we have recently implemented a fraud prevention and quality assurance unit  that while not yet fully developed  is expected to identify and terminate fraudulent claims 
we believe that these and other changes currently contemplated could reduce future claims below the levels anticipated as a result of our third quarter analysis 
in our year end claim reserve analysis  we continued to see positive trends 
accordingly  we have considered these trends in evaluating our claims reserves 
we estimate that the impact of the reflection of these trends results in a reduction of our claims reserves approximately or  this  has increased earnings in the fourth quarter of further  by employing a lower discount rate of in the period  rather than the that had been used in prior periods  we increased our claims reserves by approximately  we believe that  as a result of lower market interest rates  the lower discount rate more closely matches our currently anticipated return from the investment of assets supporting these reserves 
in  two factors affected the reserves we held for claims incurred in prior years 
excluding  from the effect of imputed interest  we added  to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals 
prior to  we based our expectations on claim continuance patterns determined from our historical claims payments 
in  we engaged a new consulting actuary that provided us with additional industry data to incorporate in our revised continuance expectations the probability that a claim in one duration will continue to another 
our analysis of this supplemental data suggested that we would recognize higher future payments on currently incurred claims than was previously anticipated 
as a result  we lengthened our continuance tables for claim durations beyond the third year  and increased our reserves held for claims incurred to record this liability 
we believe that our experience for claims in the first  second and third duration was consistent with industry data and  therefore  did not alter this portion of our continuance tables 
in  we reduced the discount rate used in the establishment of reserves to appropriately reflect the current investment rate earned on assets supporting this liability 
as a result  reserves for claims incurred in prior years was increased  in  we recognized a premium deficiency and unlocked our prior reserve assumptions 
these assumptions include interest rates  premium rates  shock lapses and anti selection of policyholder persistence 
in  we again recognized a premium deficiency due to anticipated investment earnings rate reductions and expected acceleration and amount of future claims payments  primarily offset by increased expectations of premium rate increases 
as a result  we unlocked our prior reserve assumptions and employed new expectations in the establishment of future reserves 
reserves were not reduced as a result of this change in assumptions see net policy acquisition costs amortized deferred 
when we experience deviation from our estimates  we typically seek premium rate increases that are sufficient to offset future deviation 
during the third quarter  we filed for premium rate increases on the majority of our policy forms 
these rate increases were sought as a result of increased loss ratios resulting from higher claims expectations than existed at the time of the original form filings 
the assumptions used in requesting and supporting the premium rate increase filings are consistent with those incorporated in our newest policy form offerings 
we have currently received approval for more than of the rate increases requested 
we have been generally successful in the past in obtaining state insurance department approvals for increases 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining future rate increases when deemed necessary  or if we do not pursue rate increases when actual claims experience exceeds our expectations  we would suffer a financial loss 
we may also be susceptible to adverse selection in our claims experience resulting from the lapse of healthier policyholders that do not elect to renew their policies at the higher premium rates 
commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in the period  compared to  in the period 
first year commissions on accident and health business in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period  due to the decrease in first year accident and health premiums 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in the period and in the period 
we believe that the decrease in the first year commission ratio is primarily attributable to the increased sale of our secured risk and medicare supplement policies as a percentage of total sales 
these policies pay a lower commission 
our secured risk policy provides limited benefits to higher risk policyholders at a substantially increased premium rate 
we believe that we are likely to experience an increase in the sale of these policies as a percentage of new sales when we recommence sales in many states as a result of our lower financial ratings with am best and standard and poor s rating services 
renewal commissions on accident and health business in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in the period and in the period 
we began the implementation of premium rate increases averaging approximately on of our policies in force at the end of the period  for which we do not pay commissions 
as a result  commission ratios are reduced 
in addition  during  we experienced the sale of a greater portion of higher risk policies that generally have a higher premium and reduced or no renewal commission structure 
the reduced commission ratio in the period is  in part  due to the impact of these policies being renewed 
during the period  we reduced commission expense by netting  as an intercompany elimination   from override commissions affiliated insurers paid to our agency subsidiaries 
during the period  we reduced commissions by  net policy acquisition costs amortized deferred 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs in the period increased to a net amortization of costs of  compared to  in the period 
deferred costs are typically all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of new premiums 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commission rate less ultimate renewal commission rates  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy underwriting 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event that a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premium generation 
lower new premium sales during the period produced significantly less expense deferral to offset amortized costs 
we regularly assess the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than current unamortized deferred acquisition costs  the unamortized amount is deemed recoverable 
in the event recoverability is not demonstrated  we reassess the calculation using justifiable premium rate increases 
if rate increases are not received or are deemed unjustified  we will expense  as impaired  the attributed portion of the deferred asset in the current period 
if we conclude that the deferred acquisition costs are impaired  we will record an impairment loss and a reduction in the deferred acquisition cost asset 
in the event of an impairment  we will also evaluate our historical assumptions utilized in establishing the policy reserves and deferred acquisition costs and may update those assumptions to reflect current experience referred to as unlocking 
the primary assumptions include persistency  claims expectations  interest rates and rate increases 
during  we recognized an impairment of our deferred acquisition costs of approximately  due to our anticipation of reduced future investment earnings rates and accelerated claims and higher ultimate claim payments  substantially offset by increased premium rate expectations 
in the event planned premium rate increases are not achieved  we could recognize an additional impairment of our deferred acquisition costs in the future  which could have a material adverse affect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
during  we recognized an impairment of our deferred acquisition costs of approximately  effective december   we entered into a reinsurance agreement covering substantially all of our long term care policies 
the reinsurance agreement includes an annual expense and risk charge  which the reinsurer credits against our experience account 
since we anticipate that we will commute the reinsurance agreement  we include these expenses in our future profit analysis 
the reduction in the anticipated future gross profits resulting from the expense and risk charges was the primary factor causing the impairment of the deferred acquisition costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in the period decreased to  compared to  in the period 
the and periods include  and  respectively  of general and administrative expenses related to united insurance group expense 
the ratio of total general and administrative expenses to premium revenues  excluding united insurance group  was in the period  compared to in the period 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
see new accounting principles  expenses were reduced by  due to the cessation of goodwill amortization 
certain expenses have declined as a result of reduced new premium sales  related underwriting and policy issuance expenses and management initiatives to reduce operating expenses 
however  we believe that if we remain unable to write new business in certain states where we have ceased new production  or if we are unable to utilize our existing staff and infrastructure capacity to generate additional premiums  we will need to decrease production expenses further 
expense and risk charges on reinsurance and excise tax expense 
our reinsurance agreement provides the reinsurer with annual expense and risk charges  which are credited against our experience account in the event of future commutation of the agreement 
the annual charge consists of a fixed cost and a variable component based upon reserve and capital levels needed to support the reinsured business 
in the period  we incurred a charge of  for this charge 
in addition  we are subject to an excise tax for premium payments made to a foreign reinsurer 
we recorded  for excise tax expenses in the period and recorded  in the period in connection with the effective date of the agreement 
provision for federal income taxes 
as a result of current losses  our provision for federal income taxes for the period decreased to an income tax benefit of  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the period 
the effective tax rate of in the and periods is below the normal federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the tax exempt nature of income from our investments in corporate owned life insurance 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
we recognized an impairment loss of  in the period as a result of our transitional impairment test of goodwill 
see new accounting principles 
comprehensive income loss 
during the period  our investment portfolio generated pre tax unrealized gains of  compared to unrealized gains of  in the period 
the reduced unrealized gain at december  is primarily attributable to the sale of the majority of our investment portfolio in conjunction with the initial premium payment for our reinsurance agreement 
after accounting for deferred taxes from these gains  shareholders equity decreased by  from comprehensive losses during the period  compared to comprehensive losses of  in the period 
twelve months ended december  and amounts in thousands premiums 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve month period ended december   including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  decreased to  compared to  in the twelve month period ended december  total premium in the period was reduced by  as a result of premium ceded for the reinsurance of our disability product line 
total first year premiums earned in decreased to  compared to  in first year long term care premiums earned in decreased to  compared to  in we experienced significant reductions in new premium sales due to the cessation of new business generation in all states during the third and fourth quarters and as a result of the market s concerns regarding our insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus 
effective september   we discontinued the sale  nationally  of all new long term care insurance policies until our corrective action plan was completed and approved by the department 
this decision resulted from our concern about further depletion of statutory surplus from new sales prior to the completion and approval of the corrective action plan and from increasing concern regarding our financial status expressed by many states in which we are licensed to conduct business 
under our corrective action plan  we intend to limit future new business growth to levels that will allow us to maintain sufficient statutory surplus 
see liquidity and capital resources 
since the approval of our corrective action plan on february   we have recommenced sales in states and are continuing efforts to recommence new policy sales in all states upon individual state approvals 
total renewal premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in renewal long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in this increase reflects renewals of a larger base of in force policies  as well as a continued increase in policyholder persistency 
net investment income 
net investment income earned during increased to  from  for management attributes this growth to an increase in invested assets  which resulted from premium receipts and from the investment of additional funds generated from the exercise of rights to purchase shares of our common stock distributed to our shareholders and holders of our subordinated notes 
our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was in  compared to in the average yield is lower due to reduced market rates for reinvesting of maturing investments and due to higher cash balances held during the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was and for and  respectively 
including the effect of realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and trading account results arising during the period  the total return of our fixed income portfolio was and in the and periods  respectively 
while the performance in the was similar to the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index  our performance was below the benchmark index due primarily to significant declines in the market value of three bonds during the year  totaling approximately  net realized capital gains and trading account activity 
during  we recognized capital losses of  compared to capital gains of in the results of both years were recorded due to realized gains and losses from our normal investment management operations and from impairment losses of approximately  in and  in on equity and debt securities  which we deemed to be other than temporary 
at december   we entered a reinsurance agreement for which a substantial portion of our investment portfolio was later ceded as the initial premium for this agreement 
as a result of this intended transfer or sale of assets  we determined that all gross unrealized losses on our debt and equities securities would not be recovered and therefore were deemed other than temporary impairments 
we recognized a loss of  from this determination 
we classified our convertible bond portfolio as trading account investments as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

changes in trading account investment market values are recorded in our statement of operations during the period in which the change occurs  rather than as an unrealized gain or loss recorded directly through equity 
therefore  we recorded a trading account loss in of  which reflects the unrealized and realized loss of our convertible portfolio that arose during the year ended december  we sold all of our convertible bond investments during other income 
we recorded  in other income during  up from  in the increase is attributable to an increase of commissions earned by united insurance group on sales of insurance products underwritten by unaffiliated insurers and to income generated from corporate owned life insurance policies 
benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in decreased to  compared to  in our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in  compared to in we review the adequacy of our deferred acquisition costs on an annual basis  utilizing assumptions for future expected claims and interest rates 
if we determine that the future gross profits of our in force policies are not sufficient to recover our deferred acquisition costs  we recognize a premium deficiency and unlock or change our original assumptions and reset our reserves to appropriate levels using new assumptions 
during the second quarter of  we performed a dac recoverability analysis on our existing business  utilizing our most current assumptions 
upon the completion of the analysis  we determined to record an impairment charge of approximately and utilized the new assumptions in the establishment of our current dac and policy benefit reserves  in accordance with sfas this reset of dac and reserves resulted in a decrease of approximately  to reserves and a decrease to dac of approximately  representing and of the respective balances 
the resultant net gaap liability reserves less dac is higher than before the impairment charge 
we believe that the new levels of dac and reserves more appropriately represent the future anticipated development of both accounts 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
when we experience adverse deviation from our estimates  we typically seek premium rate increases that are sufficient to offset future deviation 
during  we filed premium rate increases on the majority of our policy forms in a majority of states 
these rate increases were sought as a result of higher claims expectations and policyholder persistency than existed at the time of the original form filings 
the assumptions used in requesting and supporting the premium rate increase filings are consistent with those incorporated in our newest policy form offerings 
we have been generally successful in the past in obtaining state insurance department approvals for increases 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining rate increases when deemed necessary  or if we do not pursue rate increases when actual claims experience exceeds our expectations  we could suffer a financial loss 
due to the utilization of assumptions in establishing reserves  it has been necessary in the past for us to increase the estimated liabilities reflected in our reserves for claims and policy expenses 
in the year in which a claim is first incurred  we establish policy and contract claims reserves that are actuarially determined to be the present value of all future payments required for that claim 
we assume that our current reserve amount and interest income earned on invested assets will be sufficient to make all future payments 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
this amount of  and  in and  respectively  includes imputed interest from prior year end reserve balances plus adjustments to reflect actual versus estimated claims experience 
these adjustments particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
the adjustments to reserves for claims incurred in prior periods are primarily attributable to claims incurred from our long term care insurance policies  which represent approximately of our premium in force 
we evaluate the assumptions utilized at the time the claim is incurred compared to our most current assumptions 
in  two factors affected the reserves we held for claims incurred in prior years 
excluding  from the effect of imputed interest  we added  to our claim reserves for and prior claim incurrals 
prior to  we based our expectations on claim continuance patterns determined from our historical claims payments 
in  we engaged a new consulting actuary that provided us with additional industry data to incorporate in our revised continuance expectations the probability that a claim in one duration will continue to another 
our analysis of this supplemental data suggested that we would recognize higher future payments on currently incurred claims than was previously anticipated 
as a result  we lengthened our continuance tables for claim durations beyond the third year  and increased our reserves held for claims incurred to record this liability 
we believe that our experience for claims in the first  second and third duration was consistent with industry data and  therefore  did not alter this portion of our continuance tables 
in  we reduced the discount rate used in the establishment of reserves to appropriately reflect the current investment rate earned on assets supporting this liability 
as a result  reserves for claims incurred in prior years was increased  in  excluding the effect of  from imputed interest  we added  for claims incurred in prior years 
while this increase in reserves for prior year incurred claims of does not reflect a material variance from our expectations  we believe that the increases were attributable to the method we employed for determining incurred but not reported claims ibnr 
this method sought to project a ratio of incurred claims to earned premium based upon historic experience and current trends 
the actual number and type of claims that were ultimately reported to us exceeded the amount of ibnr that we had recorded at the original estimated date 
the establishment of reserves for claims liabilities incorporates assumptions regarding the duration of claims  lag in reporting of claims  and interest discount rates 
we periodically reevaluate these assumptions based upon actual results 
although we believe that our current reserves accurately reflect our most recent assumptions  continued adverse claims experience could result in additional future increases 
adverse development of our claim reserves  however  will not generally be known until future payments occur or other evidence exists to cause us to change our assumptions 
as a result  we could experience positive or negative deviation from the established reserves  which would impact our results of operations 
commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in  compared to  in first year commissions on accident and health business in decreased to  compared to  in  due to the decrease in first year accident and health premiums 
the mix of policyholder issue ages for new business affects the percentage of commissions paid for new business due to our age scaled commission rates 
generally  sales to younger policyholders result in a higher commission percentage 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in renewal commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  consistent with the increase in renewal premiums discussed above 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in  which varies as a result of the weighting of policies written by agents with differing contracts 
during and  we reduced commission expense  as an intercompany elimination  by netting  and  respectively  from override commissions that affiliated insurers paid to our subsidiary agencies 
the reduction in commission overrides earned by these agencies in resulted from our suspension of new sales in all states at varying times throughout net policy acquisition costs amortized deferred and impairment of dac 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs in decreased to a net amortization of  compared to net deferrals of  in deferred costs typically include all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of policies 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commission rate less ultimate renewal commission rates  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy underwriting 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premiums generation 
lower new premium sales during produced significantly less expense deferral to offset amortized costs 
during  with the assistance of our consulting actuary  we completed an analysis to determine if existing policy reserves and policy and contract claim reserves  together with the present value of future gross premiums  would be sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and settlement and maintenance costs and recover unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs  referred to as recoverability analysis 
we determined that we would require premium rate increases on certain of our existing products in order to fully recover our present deferred acquisition cost asset from future profits 
we perform the recoverability analysis each quarter 
during the second quarter we recognized an impairment charge of as a result of this analysis 
effective december   we entered a reinsurance agreement for substantially all of our long term care insurance policies 
the reinsurance agreement includes an annual expense and risk charges 
these additional expense and risk charges reduced our anticipated future gross profits and resulted in a further impairment of our deferred policy acquisition cost asset of  we also amortized approximately  more of deferred acquisition cost asset during due to changing our future assumptions 
see premiums 
when an impairment occurs  the historical assumptions utilized in the establishment of the reserves and dac are unlocked and based on current assumptions 
changes in policy reserves and unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs will be based on these revised assumptions in future periods 
in determining the impairment  we evaluated future claims expectations  premium rates and our ability to obtain future rate increases  persistency and expense projections 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in decreased to  compared to  in the amounts for the years ended and  respectively  include  and  related to united insurance group 
the ratio of total general and administrative expenses  excluding united insurance group expense  to premium revenues was in  compared to in general and administrative expenses were increased during as a result of supplemental accounting and actuarial fees  legal fees  depreciation expenses and the recognition of of compensation expense related to the variable treatment of options granted to employees 
the compensation expense represents the december  market value of our common stock in excess of the grant price of the options 
throughout we took certain actions to reduce costs  including staff eliminations  marketing reductions and overhead eliminations 
we believe that if we remain unable to write new policies in states where we have ceased new production  we will need to decrease production expenses further 
as a result of our december  reinsurance agreement with a foreign reinsurer  we must pay federal excise tax of on all ceded premium 
at december   we accrued  of excise tax  which represents the total amount due for the transfer of premium at the inception of the agreement 
this amount was paid in the first quarter reserve for claim litigation 
in the second quarter  a jury awarded compensatory damages of and punitive damages of  in favor of the plaintiff in a disputed claim case against one of our subsidiaries 
we subsequently appealed the decision 
during the second quarter  we agreed to settle the claim for rather than pursuing the appeal process 
provision for federal income taxes 
our provision for federal income taxes for decreased to a tax benefit of  compared to a tax provision of  for as a result of net losses in during  we determined that the net operating loss carryforward attributable to our non life parent may be impaired due to the life subsidiary s inability to utilize these losses within the allowed future periods 
as a result  we recognized a valuation allowance of  to our deferred tax asset in comprehensive income 
during  our investment portfolio generated pre tax  unrealized gains of  compared to  in after accounting for deferred taxes from these gains  shareholders equity decreased by  from comprehensive losses during  compared to comprehensive income of  in liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands our consolidated liquidity requirements have historically been met from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  from our agency subsidiaries and from funds raised in the capital markets 
our primary sources of cash are premiums  investment income and maturities of investments 
we have obtained  and may in the future obtain  cash through public and private offerings of our common stock  the exercise of stock options and warrants  other capital markets activities including the sale or exchange of debt instruments  payments to policyholders  investment purchases and general and administrative expenses 
our report of independent accountants contained a going concern opinion resulting from uncertainty regarding penn treaty liquidity and insurance subsidiary statutory surplus 
our and reports of independent accountants do not contain a going concern opinion because of the steps that we have taken to improve parent company liquidity and insurance subsidiary statutory surplus  including the approval of our corrective action plan by the pennsylvania insurance department  our reinsurance agreement with centre solutions bermuda limited for policies issued prior to december  see subsidiary operations  the public and private placement of additional shares of our common stock and the exchange of some of our convertible debt securities and the issuance of new convertible debt securities see penn treaty operations 
however  we cannot make assurances that parent company liquidity and insurance subsidiary statutory surplus will not cause uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern without additional resources in the future

penn treaty operations penn treaty is a non insurer that directly controls of the voting stock of our insurance subsidiaries 
if we are unable to meet our financial obligations  become insolvent or discontinue operations  the financial condition and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries could be materially affected 
we have successfully engaged in capital markets activities  including issuance of both debt and equity capital  over the past two years to fund our liquidity and subsidiary capital needs 
these equity activities have included on april   we distributed rights to our shareholders and holders of our convertible subordinated notes due rights offering for the purpose of raising new equity capital 
pursuant to the rights offering  holders of our common stock and holders of our convertible subordinated notes received rights to purchase  newly issued shares of common stock at a set price of per share 
the rights offering was completed on may  and generated net proceeds of  in additional equity capital 
we contributed  of the net proceeds to the statutory capital of our subsidiaries 
in march  we completed a private placement of shares of common stock for net proceeds of  the common stock was sold to several current and new institutional investors  at per share 
the offering price was a percent discount to the day average price of our common stock prior to the issuance of the new shares 
we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on june  to register these shares for resale 
in june  we completed a private placement of shares of common stock as compensation to our financial advisor 
we filed a registration statement for of these additional shares with the securities and exchange commission on june  in november  we completed an additional private placement of shares of common stock to the same financial advisor 
at december   our debt primarily consisted of  of convertible subordinated notes due the notes and  of convertible subordinated notes due the exchange notes  which are described in more detail as follows o the notes  issued in november  are convertible into common stock at per share until maturity in december at maturity  to the extent that any portion has not been converted into common stock  we will have to repay their entire principal amount in cash 
the notes carry a fixed interest coupon of  payable semi annually 
o in september  we commenced an offer of up to  in aggregate principal amount of exchange notes in exchange for up to all of our then outstanding notes 
under the terms of the exchange offer  the new notes would have terms similar to the former notes but mature in october and would be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 
prior to the termination of the exchange offer  we reduced the conversion price to  then  and ultimately in february o in addition  beginning in october  the exchange notes are mandatorily convertible if  at any time  the day average closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price 
o we exchanged approximately  of the notes for exchange notes prior to december  during the first quarter of  we exchanged an additional  of notes for exchange notes 
we expect to retire any outstanding amount of the notes on or before their contractual maturity in december at december   our total debt and financing obligations through were as follows lease debt obligations total total   debt obligations in include a  mortgage obligation of our subsidiary 
other amounts due after are immaterial 
in december  we commenced the sale of up to  in convertible subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes were originally offered  and were later modified  with identical terms to the exchange notes 
in february  we completed the sale of notes and received proceeds of  we used  of the proceeds to satisfy the premium to surplus requirements of our voluntary consent order with the florida insurance department 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds to supplement parent liquidity  retire our remaining notes  and for general working capital purposes 
in march  we issued an additional  of notes  issued under a new prospectus supplement 
after adjusting for the further exchange of notes for exchange notes in march  and the issuance of notes in february and march   our total debt and financing obligations through will be as follows lease debt obligations total total   cash flow needs of penn treaty primarily include interest payments on outstanding debt and operating expenses 
the funding is primarily derived from the operating cash flow of our agency subsidiary operations and dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
however  as noted above  the dividend capabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are limited and we may need to rely upon the dividend capabilities of our agency subsidiaries to meet current liquidity needs 
our current cash on hand and these sources of funds are expected to be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs through september  but may be insufficient to meet our interest payments on and after october we will need to raise additional capital to satisfy any parent company liquidity needs  including debt service payments  beyond october our anticipated cash needs for are as follows retirement of notes  debt interest payments  other parent expenses  net of subsidiary reimbursement our anticipated cash provided for is as follows proceeds from debt offering  agency subsidiary dividends  subsidiary operations our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by various state insurance departments 
in its ongoing effort to improve solvency regulation  the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks  such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that an insurer must maintain 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which may require specific corrective action depending upon the insurer s state of domicile 
our insurance subsidiaries  penn treaty network america insurance company  american network insurance company  and american independent network insurance company of new york representing approximately  and of our in force premium  respectively are required to hold statutory surplus that is above a certain required level 
if the statutory surplus of either of our subsidiaries falls below such level  the pennsylvania or new york insurance department would be required to place such subsidiary under regulatory control  leading to rehabilitation or liquidation 
at december   penn treaty had total adjusted capital at the regulatory action level 
as a result  it was required to file a corrective action plan the plan with the pennsylvania insurance department the department 
on february   the department approved the plan 
as a primary component of the plan  effective december   penn treaty network america insurance company and american network insurance company entered a reinsurance transaction to reinsure  on a quota share basis  substantially all of our long term care insurance policies then in force 
the agreement is subject to certain coverage limitations  including an aggregate limit of liability that is a function of certain factors and that may be reduced in the event that the rate increases that the reinsurance agreement may require are not obtained 
we are required to perform annual comparisons of our actual to expected claims experience 
if we have reason to believe  whether from this analysis or other available information  that at least a premium rate increase is necessary  we are obligated to file and obtain such premium rate increases in order to comply with the requirements of the agreement 
if we do not file and obtain such premium rate increases  our aggregate limit of liability would be reduced by of the premium amount that would have otherwise been received 
as part of this agreement  annual risk charges in excess of  are credited against our experience account by the reinsurer 
the annual amount increases if we do not commute before january  this agreement meets the requirements to qualify for reinsurance treatment under statutory accounting rules 
however  this agreement does not qualify for reinsurance treatment in accordance with fasb no 
because  based on our analysis  the agreement does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss 
this is due to a number of factors related to the agreement  including experience refund provisions  the expense and risk charges credited to the experience account by the reinsurer and the aggregate limit of liability 
the initial premium of the treaties was approximately  comprised of  of cash and qualified securities transferred in february  and  as funds held due to the reinsurer 
the initial premium and future cash flows from the reinsured policies  less claims payments  ceding commissions and risk charges  is credited to a notional experience account  which is held for our benefit in the event of commutation and recapture on or after december  the notional experience account balance receives an investment credit based upon the total return from a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges that are intended to match the duration of our reserve liability 
our current modeling and actuarial projections suggest that we are likely to be able to commute the agreement  as planned  on december  in order to commute the agreement  our statutory capital following commutation must be sufficient to support the reacquired business in compliance with all statutory requirements 
upon commutation  we would receive cash or other liquid assets equaling the market value of our experience account from the reinsurer 
we would also record the necessary reserves for the business in our statutory financial statements 
our ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the market value of the experience account exceeding the level of required reserves to be established 
in addition to the performance of the reinsured policies from now until  the experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current experience account by approximately million and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the experience account balance prior to commutation 
we intend to give notice to the reinsurer of our intention to commute on december  at such time as we are highly confident of our ability to support the reacquired policies 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the experience account at that time  and to then invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility 
as part of our reinsurance agreement  effective december   the reinsurer was granted four tranches of warrants to purchase shares of non voting convertible preferred stock 
the first three tranches of warrants are exercisable through december  at common stock equivalent prices ranging from to per share 
if exercised for cash  at the reinsurer s option  the warrants could yield additional capital and liquidity of approximately  and the convertible preferred stock would represent  if converted  approximately of the then outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis 
if the agreement is not commuted on or after december   the reinsurer may exercise the fourth tranche of convertible preferred stock purchase warrants at a common stock equivalent price of per share  potentially generating additional capital of  and  if converted  the convertible preferred stock would represent an additional of the then outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
no assurance can be given that the reinsurer will exercise any or all of the warrants granted or that it will pay cash in connection with their exercise 
as a result of our intention to commute  we assessed only the expense and risk credits anticipated prior to the commutation date in our most recent dac recoverability analyses and are not recording the potential of future escalating charges in our current financial statements 
in addition  we are recognizing the up front costs of entering into the agreement  including the fair value of the warrants granted to the reinsurer  over the period of time to the expected commutation date 
in the event we determine that commutation of the reinsurance agreement is unlikely on december   but likely at some future date  we will include additional annual expense risk charge credits against our experience account in our dac recoverability analysis 
as a result  we could impair the value of our dac asset and record the impairment in our financial statements 
however  we currently believe that we will have a sufficient amount of statutory capital and surplus to do so by december  or that sufficient alternatives  such as additional capital issuance or new reinsurance opportunities  are available to enable us to commute the agreement as planned 
the reinsurance agreement also granted the reinsurer an option to participate in reinsuring new business sales on a quota share basis 
in august  the reinsurer exercised its option to reinsure up to of future sales  subject to a limitation of the reinsurer s risk 
the reinsurer may continue this level of participation on the next million in new policy premium issued after january  the final agreement  which was entered into in december  further provides the reinsurer the option to reinsure a portion of the next billion in newly issued long term care annual insurance premium  subject to maximum quota share amounts of up to as additional policies are written 
this agreement does not qualify for reinsurance treatment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap because  based on our analysis  the agreement does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss 
this is due to an aggregate limit of liability that reduces the likelihood of the reinsurer realizing a significant loss on the agreement 
however  this agreement meets the requirements to qualify for reinsurance treatment under statutory accounting rules 
in february  the reinsurer notified us that it may  for reasons unrelated to us  discontinue its quota share reinsurance of new long term care insurance policies issued on or after september  the company s separate agreement with the reinsurer to reinsure existing policies issued prior to december  will be unaffected by any determination made by the reinsurer regarding newly issued policies 
upon the department s approval of the plan in february  we recommenced new policy sales in states  including pennsylvania 
we have now recommenced new policy sales in additional states  including florida  virginia and texas  which have historically represented approximately  and of our new policy sales  respectively 
we are actively working with the remaining states to recommence new policy sales in all jurisdictions 
we have recently agreed upon terms for the recommencement of sales in california  which has historically represented approximately of our new policy sales 
the plan requires us to comply with certain agreements at the direction of the department  including  but not limited to o new investments are limited to naic or rated securities 
o affiliated transactions are limited and require department approval 
o an agreement to increase statutory reserves by an additional  throughout of which  remained at december   such that our subsidiaries policy reserves will be based on new  current claims assumptions and will not include any rate increases 
these claim assumptions are applied to all policies  regardless of issue year and are assumed to have been present since the policy was first issued 
the reinsurance agreement has provided the capacity to accommodate this increase 
effective september   we determined to discontinue the sale nationally of all new long term care insurance policies until the plan was approved by the department 
the decision resulted from our concern about further depletion of statutory surplus from new sales prior to the completion and approval of the plan and from increasing concern regarding our status by many states in which we are licensed to conduct business 
the form of our cessation varied by state  ranging from no action to certificate suspensions 
the majority of our insurance subsidiaries cash flow results from our existing long term care policies  which have been ceded to the reinsurer under this agreement 
our subsidiaries ability to meet additional liquidity needs and cover fixed expenses in the future is highly dependent upon our ability to issue new policies and to control expense growth 
our future growth and new policy issuance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our historical markets  retain and expand our network of agents and effectively market our products and our ability to fund our marketing and expansion while maintaining minimum statutory levels of capital and surplus required to support such growth 
under the insurance laws of pennsylvania and new york  where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  insurance companies can pay ordinary dividends only out of earned surplus 
in addition  under pennsylvania law  our pennsylvania insurance subsidiaries including our primary insurance subsidiary must give the department at least days advance notice of any proposed extraordinary dividend and cannot pay such a dividend if the department disapproves the payment during that day period 
for purposes of that provision  an extraordinary dividend is a dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s surplus as shown on the company s last annual statement filed with department or its statutory net income as shown on that annual statement 
statutory earnings are generally lower than earnings reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles due to the immediate or accelerated recognition of all costs associated with premium growth and benefit reserves 
additionally  the plan requires the department to approve all dividend requests made by penn treaty network america  regardless of normal statutory requirements for allowable dividends 
we believe that the department is unlikely to consider any dividend request in the foreseeable future  as a result of penn treaty network america s current statutory surplus position 
although not stipulated in the plan  this requirement is likely to continue until such time as penn treaty meets normal statutory allowances  including reported net income and positive cumulative earned surplus 
we do not expect that this will occur in the foreseeable future 
under new york law  our new york insurance subsidiary american independent must give the new york insurance department days advance notice of any proposed dividend and cannot pay any dividend if the regulator disapproves the payment during that day period 
in addition  our new york insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the new york insurance department before paying any dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the lesser of of the insurance company s surplus as of the preceding december or its adjusted net investment income for the year ended the preceding december penn treaty network america insurance company and american network insurance company have not paid any dividends to penn treaty for the past three years and are unlikely in the foreseeable future to be able to make dividend payments due to insufficient statutory surplus and anticipated earnings 
however  our new york subsidiary is not subject to the plan and was permitted by new york statute to make a dividend payment following december  consequently  in  penn treaty received a dividend from our new york subsidiary of our subsidiaries debt currently consists primarily of a mortgage note in the amount of  that was issued by a former subsidiary and assumed by us when that subsidiary was sold 
the mortgage note is currently amortized over years  and has a balloon payment due on the remaining outstanding balance in december although the note carries a variable interest rate  we have entered into an amortizing swap agreement with the same bank with a nominal amount equal to the outstanding debt  which has the effect of converting the note to a fixed rate of interest of

sfas no 
 business combinations  requires usage of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june   and prohibits the usage of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
the provisions of sfas no 
relating to the application of the purchase method are generally effective for business combinations completed after july  such provisions include guidance on the identification of the acquiring entity  the recognition of intangible assets other than goodwill acquired in a business combination and the accounting for negative goodwill 
the transition provisions of sfas no 
require an analysis of goodwill acquired in purchase business combinations prior to july  to identify and reclassify separately identifiable intangible assets currently recorded as goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and ceased amortizing goodwill at that time 
during the second quarter  we completed an impairment analysis of goodwill  in accordance with fasb no 
our goodwill was recorded as a result of the purchase of its agencies and its insurance subsidiaries 
as part of our evaluation  we completed numerous steps in determining the recoverability of its goodwill 
the first required step was the measurement of total enterprise fair value versus book value 
because our fair market value  as measured by our stock price  was below book value at january   goodwill was next evaluated at a reporting unit level  which comprised our insurance agencies and insurance subsidiaries 
upon completion of our evaluation  we determined that the goodwill associated with the agency purchases was fully recoverable 
the deficiency of current market value to book value was assigned to the insurance subsidiary values 
as a result  we determined that the goodwill associated with our insurance subsidiaries was impaired and recognized an impairment loss of  from our transitional impairment test of goodwill  which we recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the impairment has been recorded effective january  management has completed an assessment of other intangible assets and has determined to continue to amortize these assets so as to closely match the future profit emergence from these assets 
at december   these intangible assets have been reclassified from goodwill to other assets on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follow an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets 
a significant portion of assets and liabilities are financial instruments  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk on fixed rate domestic medium term instruments and  to a lesser extent  domestic short term and long term instruments 
we have established strategies  asset quality standards  asset allocations and other relevant criteria for our portfolio to manage our exposure to market risk 
we currently have an interest rate swap on our mortgage  which is used as a hedge to convert the mortgage to a fixed interest rate 
we believe that  since the notional amount of the swap is amortized at the same rate as the underlying mortgage and both financial instruments are with the same bank  no credit or financial risk is carried with the swap 
our financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
our portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers other than us treasury and agency obligations  industry segments or geographic regions 
however  our experience account balance  which represents substantially all of our investable assets at december   is with one reinsurer 
although sufficient assets to support our statutory reserve liabilities are secured by trust accounts and irrevocable letters of credit with major united states financial institutions  the accumulated profits of our reinsured business are susceptible to significant credit risk of the reinsurer 
we urge caution in evaluating overall market risk from the information below 
actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables are excluded in the hypothetical effects insurance liabilities represent of total liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses and experience account due from reinsurer represent of total assets 
long term debt  although not carried at fair value  is included in the hypothetical effect calculation 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of our financial instruments including our experience account balance  as discussed below as of december   excluding insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses because such insurance related assets and liabilities are not carried at fair value  would have been as follows if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value of our investment portfolio less our long term debt and the related swap agreement 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by and basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value of our investment portfolio less our long term debt and the related swap agreement 
the change in fair value was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using models that measure the change in net present values arising from selected hypothetical changes in market interest rate 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by and basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
effective december   we entered a reinsurance agreement to reinsure  on a quota share basis  substantially all of our long term care insurance policies in force 
the transaction resulted in the transfer of debt and equity securities of approximately million to the reinsurer 
the agreements provide us the opportunity to commute and recapture after december  to that end  the reinsurer will maintain a notional experience account for our benefit only in the event of commutation and recapture  which reflects the initial premium paid  future premiums collected net of claims  expenses and accumulated investment earnings 
the notional experience account balance will receive an investment credit based upon the total return of a series of benchmark indices and hedges that are designed to closely match the duration of reserve liabilities 
as a result  we will likely experience significant volatility in our future financial statements 
our ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the market value of the experience account exceeding the level of required reserves to be established 
in addition to the performance of the reinsured policies from now until  the experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current experience account by approximately million and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the experience account balance prior to commutation 
we intend to give notice to the reinsurer of our intention to commute on december  at such time as we are highly confident of our ability to support the reacquired policies 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the experience account at that time  and to then invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility 
we hold certain mortgage and asset backed securities as part of our investment portfolio 
the fair value of these instruments may react in a convex or non linear fashion when subjected to interest rate increases or decreases 
the anticipated cash flows of these instruments may differ from expectations in changing interest rate environments  resulting in duration drift or a varying nature of predicted time weighted present values of cash flows 
the result of unpredicted cash flows from these investments could cause the above hypothetical estimates to change 
however  we believe that the minimal amount we have invested in these instruments and their broadly defined payment parameters sufficiently outweigh the cost of computer models necessary to accurately predict the possible impact on our investment income of hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments as of december
