in january  we relinquished our interest in usf asia a joint venture that provided international airfreight services 
in october  we sold our non core freight forwarding business that included several companies that operated domestically under the name usf worldwide inc worldwide and in great britain under the name usf worldwide logistics uk ltd 
ltd 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the non core freight forwarding segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
consolidated results our revenue from continuing operations for was billion  a increase from revenue of billion for income from continuing operations decreased by from million in to million in included in the income from operations is a million charge to relinquish our interest in our non core asian joint venture in january

revenue and profits were lower during the first eight months of compared to the first eight months of in early september  consolidated freightways cf  a long haul carrier  filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations 
our ltl segment captured a portion of cf s former revenue and partially as a result thereof  revenue and profits in the fourth quarter of increased by and  respectively  compared to the fourth quarter of because of the fourth quarter surge in business levels  total revenue in our ltl segment for increased by to billion from billion in in  revenue from our ltl segment amounted to of our consolidated revenue compared to in ltl revenue increased  ltl shipments increased  ltl tonnage increased and ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased but increased by approximately before the fuel surcharge 
in late june  our ltl segment enacted a general rate increase  the same as in june general rate increases apply to approximately of our ltl segment s revenue base 
the remaining of our revenue base is subject to contractual agreements  which normally result in lower rate increases 
pricing pressures continued throughout the year evidenced by the overall decrease in ltl revenue per hundredweight mentioned above 
nevertheless  rates held in the fourth quarter  as the net ltl revenue per hundredweight increased approximately compared to the net ltl revenue per hundredweight in the second quarter of our ltl segment s usf premierplus sm premierplus product  a high value interregional and nationwide service product  also benefited from cf s closure 
revenue from this product increased by in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of premierplus revenue accounted for of the ltl segment s fourth quarter revenue compared to in the fourth quarter  and for amounted to of total ltl revenue 
our ltl segment s operating income in decreased by to million from million in our ltl segment s operating ratio increased slightly to compared to in at holland  our largest subsidiary  operating income declined to million in from million in as the central us was adversely impacted by the sluggish economy 
even though holland showed increased business volumes tonnage and shipments grew by and  respectively  over its average revenue per shipment decreased  putting pressure on margins 
reddaway  which operates in the western us  reported an improved operating ratio of in compared to in through control of labor and other direct operating costs 
bestway reported a increase in operating income in compared to due mainly to a reduction in cargo claim costs in dugan  which operates in the central us and has the largest geographical coverage of any of our ltl regional carriers  reported a decline in operating income to million in compared to million in dugan s profit deterioration resulted mainly from an investment to significantly upgrade its service product by redesigning its line haul plan and  as a result  increased their labor costs for the year 
red star reported an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in red star recently closed its operations in atlanta  its southern most point of service  which is expected to reduce fixed costs in in the ltl segment  salaries  wages and benefits increased to of revenue from in due to wage increases and union health care cost increases 
fuel expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to compared to in due to declining fuel prices in the first nine months of fuel prices began to significantly increase in the fourth quarter of  however these were partially offset by fuel surcharges that the industry generally charges to its customers 
workers compensation and other insurance as well as claims expenses were generally flat in both years 
this cost control was achieved even as the segment incurred increases in insurance premiums by increasing our level of self insured risks 
reductions in cargo claims in offset the increases in workers compensation and third party liability expenses 
operating supplies and expenses increased by as revenue equipment maintenance expenses rose 
in an effort to reduce future power revenue equipment maintenance expenses  our ltl segment purchased approximately tractors in the last half of in advance of new epa regulations designed to reduce pollution levels of emissions 
these new regulations took effect on october  we generally believe that these new lower emission engines will have shorter lives and higher maintenance costs 
total revenue in our ltl segment for decreased by to billion from billion in in  revenue from our ltl segment amounted to of our consolidated revenue compared to in ltl revenue in decreased  ltl shipments decreased  ltl tonnage decreased and ltl revenue per hundredweight increased when compared to operating income in decreased by to million from million in our ltl segment  along with its peers and the rest of the us economy  endured a very slow that also saw the return of pricing pressures in the second half of the year

truckload our tl carrier  glen moore  headquartered in carlisle  pennsylvania  operates in both regional and nationwide markets 
glen moore contributed million in revenue in a increase over and its operating ratio was  generating million in operating profits compared to million in revenue  an operating ratio of and operating income of million in increases in revenue per mile  increased business volumes with new customers and with our regional ltl carriers performing the intercompany substitute line haul for our premierplus service product were primarily responsible for the revenue increase 
glen moore s improved operating ratio resulted from improvements in salaries  wages and benefits expenses as a percentage of revenue compared to in and a decrease in purchased transportation expenses to in compared to in as glen moore improved its employee driver productivity thereby reducing the need for outsourced transportation services 
fuel expense improved to of revenue in compared to in however  while fuel expense improved in as a whole  fuel expense in the fourth quarter was of revenue compared to of revenue in the fourth quarter of glen moore s revenue increased by to million in from million in and it had operating ratios of and in and  respectively 
glen moore s revenue increase was mainly attributable to an increase in revenue per mile and expansion of its customer base 
to handle this revenue increase  glen moore augmented its owned fleet by increasing partnerships with independent contractors providing an additional power units 
as a result  purchased transportation expenses increased  but were somewhat offset by decreases in fuel expenses as a percentage of revenue as fuel prices moderated in tl operations accounted for of our consolidated revenue compared to of revenue 
glen moore currently owns tractors and  trailers 
logistics revenue in our logistics segment  comprised of dedicated carriage  assembly and distribution  supply chain management  contractual warehousing and reverse logistics services was relatively flat  increasing by million a increase over to million in compared to million in in  our logistics segment accounted for of our consolidated revenue compared to in our distribution business revenue increased by million an increase over to million in from million in primarily through growth at existing distribution centers coupled with full year revenue from distribution centers that opened late in mainly in san francisco  orlando  phoenix and houston 
contractual and warehousing revenue increased in to million from million in primarily through the addition of new customers 
reverse logistics services revenue decreased to million in compared to million in most of this revenue decline came from significant volumes from a major customer that  while declining in  were non existent in operating income for our logistics segment increased by to million in from million including a million charge in the fourth quarter related to expenses arising from combining certain administrative functions within the logistics segment 
the segment s operating ratio improved to in compared to in wages and related benefits decreased to of revenue compared to in in large part due to reduced employee driver requirements  as outsourcing deliveries increased  and a full year benefit from having combined administrative functions 
outsourced transportation expenses partially offset these wage related reductions as purchased transportation costs increased to of revenue compared to of revenue due mainly to our distribution business increased dependence on outsourced deliveries 
revenue for the logistics segment in was also flat compared to increasing by million to million compared to million in in  our logistics segment accounted for of our consolidated revenue compared to in the distribution business revenue increased in from by million a increase primarily through growth at existing distribution centers coupled with revenue from new distribution centers in san francisco  orlando and houston 
contractual and warehousing revenue increased in to million primarily through the addition of new customers and expanded business with existing customers

asia  based in hong kong  provided sea air consolidation  local forwarding  customs clearance  non vessel operating common carrier nvocc and warehousing and distribution services to companies doing business to and from or within the asia pacific region 
revenue in amounted to million with an operating loss of million due in part to operating expenses that included additional startup expenses incurred during the first full year of operations 
in  revenue increased to million and operating losses declined to million 
after deciding that the asia operations were not one of our core competencies  on january   we relinquished our interest in asia and incurred a charge of million million in cash 
corporate and other included in our corporate and other segment are expenses of intangible assets  executive and corporate management  corporate it and certain expenses of our self insurance programs 
our amortization of intangible assets amounted to million  million and million  respectively  in  and on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which required us to cease amortization of goodwill 
amortization of intangible assets in includes only those intangible assets that were not subject to amortization under sfas no 
mainly customer lists 
we amortized approximately million of goodwill in as a result of our commitment to continued significant investment in it and the people that support this effort  our it group s staff size has grown from in to in and at the end of additionally  there are independent contractors that support our internal it staff 
accordingly  it s costs have risen from million in to million in and million in the remainder of our corporate expenses decreased by million in over  but increased by million in compared to as the cost of maintaining our self insurance programs increased by approximately million 
in addition  corporate non insurance related expenses increased for legal  accounting and tax related services along with an increase in donations  advertising and travel and entertainment 
other income and expense interest expense for amounted to million compared to million in our average outstanding debt in and was million and million  respectively 
in and  we had million in outstanding notes at fixed rates of interest 
in  we had outstanding notes at fixed rates of interest until the end of april amounting to million 
in late april  we replaced million of notes having a fixed interest rate of with million of notes with an fixed interest rate 
in  we had no drawings under our revolving line of credit and our other uncommitted facilities compared to when we had nominal drawings under the revolving line of credit and the uncommitted lines of credit that were paid in full prior to the end of the first quarter 
there have been no drawings under the revolving line of credit or the uncommitted lines of credit since the end of the first quarter 
interest income for amounted to million compared to million in in and  we received interest income of million and million from the settlement of tax related matters 
due to the slowing economy and our managed reduction in capital spending in and  we had cash invested in interest bearing instruments during all of and most of at the end of and  we had million and million  respectively  in interest bearing investments 
our principal debts at the end of were million in guaranteed notes  issued april  and million in guaranteed notes  issued may  during we had no drawings under our million revolving credit facility while in we had nominal borrowings 
in late october  we replaced our million revolving credit facility that was to expire in november with a million revolving credit facility that will expire at the end of october the average interest rate on our bank debt for which included only nominal drawings during the first quarter of was approximately compared to in we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility or uncommitted lines of credit since the end of the first quarter of usfreightways income taxes the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for was versus in and in the difference between the current year effective tax rate and the prior years effective tax rate is primarily related to permanent tax differences associated with the disposition of asia 
goodwill amortization is no longer a reconciling item as of due to the adoption of sfas no 
in and  goodwill amortization accounted for and  respectively  of the overall effective tax rates for those years 
outlook unknown trends or uncertainties while we believe that the current economic downturn is largely cyclical  we also expect it to impact given the current geo political risks  certain events could endanger the recovery of the economy 
we plan to monitor capital spending and cash flow as well as continue strict controls over spending and operating costs 
actual results for will depend upon a number of factors  including the extent and duration of the current economic downturn  our ability to maintain freight rates as competitors increase their pricing pressures  and our ability to increase our market share as we maintain our levels of service and at the same time introduce new service products 
liquidity and capital resources we generated million in cash flows from operating activities in compared to million in contributing to the lower cash flow from operating activities was an increase in trade receivables from increased revenue especially in the fourth quarter of  compared to lower receivable levels in when our revenue declined compared to capital expenditures during the year amounted to million  of which million was for revenue equipment including approximately million for tractors acquired ahead of the october  new engine guidelines published by the environmental protection agency  million for terminals  million for it and communications equipment  and million for other assets 
capital expenditures for amounted to million  of which million was for revenue equipment  million was for terminals  million was for it and communications gear and million was for other assets 
because of the current sluggish economic conditions  we expect that capital expenditures in will approximate million to million  before any acquisitions 
on january   we filed a form s shelf registration statement that allowed for the sale of up to million in additional guaranteed notes of which million was available for issuance as of december  we issued unsecured guaranteed notes of million on may  that are due may  and bear interest at  payable semi annually 
net proceeds from the sale of the notes amounted to million 
on april   we issued million of unsecured guaranteed notes that are due april  net proceeds from the sale of the notes amounted to million 
we used million of the net proceeds to pay off our notes that matured on may  interest on all of our notes is paid semi annually 
all these notes may be redeemed before maturity and have no sinking fund requirements 
if the notes are redeemed before maturity  the purchase price is the greater of of the principal amount of the guaranteed notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on such guaranteed notes  discounted to the redemption date  on a semi annual basis at the treasury rate plus basis points  plus accrued interest 
our guaranteed notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on an unsecured senior basis  by all our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors 
we are a holding company and during the periods presented substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary guarantors  and substantially all of our operations were conducted by the subsidiary guarantors 
accordingly  the aggregate assets  liabilities  earnings and equity of the subsidiary guarantors were substantially equivalent to the assets  liabilities  earnings and equity shown in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that separate financial statements of our subsidiary guarantors  and other disclosures relating to them  are not meaningful or material to our investors 
our subsidiaries  other than the subsidiary guarantors  are minor 
there are no restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan 
we  therefore  are not required to present separate financial statements of our subsidiary guarantors  and other disclosures relating to them 
in addition to our notes mentioned above  we have a million revolving credit facility through a syndicate of nine commercial banks 
in october  we replaced our million credit facility that was to expire in november with a million credit facility that expires in october of the facility allows up to million for standby letters of credit to cover our self insurance programs  and has optional pricing of interest rates  including libor or prime base rates 
the facility has an annual fee and contains customary financial covenants including maintenance of minimum net worth and funded debt to cash flow 
during  we had no drawings on either credit facility 
at december   we had no borrowings and had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit under this facility 
in addition to our revolving credit facility  we maintain three uncommitted lines of credit  which provide million short term funds at rates approximating libor 
these facilities are used in concert with a centralized cash management system to finance our short term working capital needs thereby enabling us to maintain minimal cash balances 
at december   we had no borrowings under these uncommitted facilities 
we believe cash flows from operating activities and funding from our revolving credit facilities are adequate to finance our anticipated business activity in annual report at december   we had capital purchase commitments of approximately million for land and improvements  million for transportation equipment  and million for other information technology related projects 
during  we repurchased approximately one million of our shares under two repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors 
the average repurchase price was approximately per share 
at december   we had authorization to purchase an additional million shares 
during  we declared cash dividends of million

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period  the reported amount of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
many of these estimates and assumptions are based on our critical accounting policies as described below 
we have applied these policies on a consistent basis from year to year 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
additionally  our audit committee of the board of directors has been informed by us and our independent auditors of the significance  sensitivity  and reasonableness of these estimates 
revenue recognition effective january   we changed our method of accounting for revenue and expense recognition for our ltl and tl segments 
in  revenue for ltl and tl operations was recognized when freight was picked up from the customer 
under the new accounting method  we recognize revenue for ltl and tl operations by the allocation of revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred 
usfreightways logistics revenue from warehousing continued to be recognized under the terms of the various contracts 
revenue from dedicated fleet shipments also continues to be recognized upon delivery  which is generally the same day as the pickup 
domestic ocean freight forwarding transportation revenue is recognized at the time freight is tendered to an ocean going vessel at origin 
in all cases  estimated expenses of performing the total transportation services are accrued concurrently with the revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts our operating segments have credit and collections procedures that are followed to determine which customers are extended credit for services provided 
services provided to customers where we are not able to determine their creditworthiness are done so on a cash on delivery basis 
we have developed a methodology based on write off history that we apply to our open accounts receivable to assess the adequacy of our allowance for debts 
our analysis provides for allowance needs that we may have for large customers that may be experiencing financial difficulty as well as the overall conditions in the economy 
casualty claims casualty claim reserves represent management s estimates of claims for property damage  public liability and workers compensation 
we manage casualty claims with the assistance of a third party administrator tpa along with its insurers 
we have a retention deductible of million for public liability and million for workers compensation 
we promote prevention as a key component in minimizing exposure to casualty claim losses 
we have developed comprehensive programs that emphasize and encourage employee safety and accident prevention 
when collisions or injuries occur  their outcomes are managed closely to bring them to conclusion efficiently  fairly  and quickly by us  our tpa  and insurers 
processes are in place to identify  evaluate  and develop individual cases as soon as possible  to facilitate recovery and return to work  or to mitigate damages 
we have developed an extensive program to aid the employee s recovery from injury  return to work  and allow resumption of the individual s normal lifestyle 
we closely monitor the casualty accruals and methodologies for accuracy 
extensive analysis enables us to estimate casualty reserves  provide for incurred but not reported cases  and development patterns of cases consistently and adequately 
at december  and we had reserve balances for casualty claims of million and million  respectively 
cargo claims our operating procedures are designed to minimize freight from being lost or damaged while in our care 
although our goal is to pick up and deliver all freight on time and without damage  given the large volume of freight movements there are situations where freight is lost or damaged while in our control 
we do not accept freight that has an excessively high value  is extremely volatile  is unusually hazardous or exhibits other unnecessary risks 
we have developed reporting procedures to monitor the claims activity at each of our terminals 
we have developed a methodology to assess our accrual needs for cargo claims 
this methodology is based on historical payment activity and lag times for reported claims 
our accrual includes an estimation of payments to be made for claims reported  claims incurred but not reported and specific estimations for any unusually large claims 
our accrual at december  and for these types of claims was million and million  respectively 
contingencies we are routinely involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business  primarily involving claims for bodily injury and property damage incurred in the transportation of freight 
we believe these matters have been adequately provided for in our financial statements and their outcome is not expected to have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of our operations 
we use underground storage tanks at certain terminal facilities and maintain a comprehensive policy of testing  upgrading  replacing or eliminating these tanks to protect the environment and comply with various federal and state laws 
we take prompt remedial action whenever any contamination is detected 
we accrue for estimated losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
we believe that our obligation with regard to these sites is not significant 
pension and post retirement health care we maintain a non qualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of a select group of our management 
the purpose of the plan is to enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel by providing an opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation that cannot be deferred under our k plan 
we also maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan defined contribution to provide benefits to a select group of our management who contribute materially to our continued growth  development and future business 
in  and  we contributed million annually to this plan 
we have established a grantor trust rabbi trust to provide funding for benefits payable under our deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans 
we do not offer post employment or post retirement benefits 
goodwill under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  previously recorded goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual undiscounted cash flow impairment tests 
if there is an apparent impairment  the fair value of the reporting unit would be calculated 
if the calculated fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized 
in  we amortized million of goodwill 
as a result of implementing this new standard on january  we no longer amortize goodwill and recorded an impairment charge of million at usf worldwide  our discontinued freight forwarding segment 
the charge was shown as a cumulative effect of change in accounting for goodwill in the first quarter of goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following annual report thousands of dollars average life yrs gross carrying amount accumulated amortization gross carrying amount accumulated amortization amortized intangible assets customer lists non competes total intangible assets not subject to amortization goodwill recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
will be effective for us on january  we have reviewed the requirements of this standard and have concluded it does not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize the costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 these types of costs were recognized at the time management committed to an exit disposal plan in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated subsequent to december  accordingly  we will apply the provisions of sfas no 
prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated subsequent to december  on november   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation expands on the accounting guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
related party disclosures  and sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the interpretation also incorporates  without change  the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which it supercedes 
the interpretation does identify several situations where the recognition of a liability at inception for a guarantor s obligation is not required 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosures are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have not determined the impact of this interpretation on our financial position or results of operations
