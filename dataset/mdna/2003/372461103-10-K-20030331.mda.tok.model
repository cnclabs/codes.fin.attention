item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview since  we have been supplying advanced manufacturing systems to the semiconductor industry worldwide 
major semiconductor manufacturers use our leading edge thin film deposition equipment and process technology to produce integrated circuits  commonly called chips  that are incorporated into a variety of products including personal computers  communications  equipment and consumer electronics 
we pioneered the development of chemical vapor deposition cvd tungsten silicide  which is used in certain critical steps in the manufacture of integrated circuits 
in addition  today we are leading the commercialization of atomic layer deposition  also known as ald technology and of our stratagem family of products 
this technology is designed to enable a wide spectrum of thin film applications such as aluminum oxide  hafnium oxide and other advanced dielectric insulating and conducting metal barrier materials for advanced integrated circuit manufacturing 
genus consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on a quarterly basis  management reevaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and relevant current conditions and adjusts the financial statements as required 
our global customer base consists of semiconductor manufacturers in the united states  europe and asia 
over the past few years we were dependent on one customer  samsung  for a majority of our thin film product revenue 
in  samsung accounted for of our revenue  in and in there is no long term agreement between us and samsung 
over the past three years  we have gradually expanded our customer base and at the end of  we had nine customers 
during the third quarter of  genus increased efforts to generate revenue from service activities by providing on site services and support for fees based on the time spent by our engineers 
currently  revenues from such services are not material  but the company hopes to expand service revenues in the future 
international revenue accounted for of revenue in  of revenue in and of revenue in we anticipate that international sales  and  in particular  sales from south korea  will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue 
the local currency is the functional currency for our foreign operations in south korea and japan 
all other foreign operations are dollar denominated 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive loss 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
to date  these gains and losses have not been material 
business activity in the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries has been cyclical  for this and other reasons  genus results of operations for the twelve months ended december   may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
in order to support our business strategy and maintain our competitiveness  we will be required to make significant investments in research and development 
in addition  we will need to divert additional resources to administration to comply with our reporting requirement under the sarbanes oxley act of based on our cost structure  we believe selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as sales volumes increase 
we depend on increases in sales in order to attain profitability 
if our sales do not increase  we may need to reduce our operating costs  which could impair our competitiveness and our future viability 
critical accounting policies the financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and require management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the sale and installation of semiconductor manufacturing systems and from engineering services and the sale of spare parts to support such systems 
equipment selling arrangements generally involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
effective january   at which time the company did not have verifiable objective evidence of the fair value of installation services  the company commenced deferring recognition of revenue from such equipment sales until installation was complete and the product was accepted by the customer to comply with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
in the third quarter of  the company established verifiable objective evidence of fair value of installation services  one of the requirements for genus to recognize revenue for multiple element arrangements prior to completion of installation services 
accordingly  under sab  if genus has met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  then the company recognizes equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title 
a portion of revenue associated with undelivered elements such as installation and on site support related tasks is recognized for installation when the installation is completed and the customer accepts the product and for on site support as the support service is provided 
for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications for the customer prior to shipment  revenue is recognized when installation is complete and the customer accepts the product 
revenues can fluctuate significantly as a result of the timing of customer acceptances 
at december  and  the company had deferred revenue of million and million  respectively 
revenues from sale of spare parts are generally recognized upon shipment 
revenues from engineering services are recognized as the services are completed over the duration of the contract 
accrual for warranty expenses the company provides one year labor and two year material warranty on its products 
warranty expenses are accrued at the time that revenue is recognized from the sale of products 
at present  based upon historical experience  the company accrues material warranty equal to and of shipment value for its mm and mm products  respectively  and labor warranty equal to  per system for both its mm and mm products 
at the end of every quarter  the company reviews its actual spending on warranty and reassesses if its accrual is adequate to cover warranty expenses on the systems in the field which are still under warranty 
differences between the required accrual and recorded accrual are charged or credited to warranty expenses for the period 
at december  and  the company had accrued  and  respectively  for material and labor warranty obligations 
actual results could differ from estimates 
in the unlikely event that a problem is identified that would result in the need to replace components on a large scale  we would experience significantly higher expenses and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely effected 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
raw material and purchased parts include spare parts inventory for systems were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the forecasted demand for spare parts takes into account the company s obligations to support systems for periods that are as long as five years 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by the company 
this could have a material effect on operating results and the financial position 
for example in  as a result of unfavorable economic conditions diminished demand for semiconductor products  and a change in the mix of products sold  the company experienced a decline in sales and recorded inventory charges of million related primarily to excess inventories 
these charges have been included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december  and  the company had written down inventories on hand by million and million  respectively 
valuation of research and demonstration equipment equipment includes research and demonstration equipment  which is located in our applications laboratory and is used to demonstrate to our customers the capabilities of our equipment to process wafers and deposit films 
the gross value of demonstration equipment is based on the cost of materials and actual factory labor and overhead expenses incurred in manufacturing the equipment 
costs related to refurbishing or maintaining existing demonstration equipment  which do not add to the capabilities or useful life of the equipment  are not capitalized and are expensed as incurred 
demonstration equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over a period of five years 
if the company sells the equipment  it may experience gross margins that are different from the gross margins achieved on equipment manufactured specifically for customers 
results of operations net sales revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
revenues were down in from and up in from revenue from the sale of systems  spares and from services in were million  million and  respectively 
revenues in included four mm systems using cvd technology  four stratagem mm systems  one stratagem mm upgrade  two mm systems using cvd technology and one stratagem mm system 
revenues in included seven mm systems using cvd technology  one mm system using cvd technology and four stratagem mm systems 
revenues in were recognized on twelve systems 
export sales were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
gross profit margin gross profit margin in was of revenues compared to in average selling prices were slightly higher in than gross profit margins were lower in due to the following factors our revenues were lower in due to customer delays in purchases 
our manufacturing overheads did not decline at the rate that revenues declined 
we incurred manufacturing inefficiencies of  related to expediting components supplies and compressing processing schedules to help our customers meet their production commitments in the fourth quarter of we recorded provisions related to inventory reserves for spare parts for our cvd equipment of million and  in and  respectively 
severance costs in cost of sales were  and  in and  respectively 
gross profit margin in was of revenues compared to a gross profit margin of in although average selling prices in were slightly higher than in  overall gross margin was lower in due to the following two factors first  capacity variances were incurred due to our lower production volume  particularly in the fourth quarter  and fixed costs related to manufacturing and international service operations 
we partially addressed this capacity issue in october by laying off employees and implementing an across the board reduced work week 
second  we incurred incremental manufacturing variances of approximately million  primarily attributable to the introduction of lynx  and excess inventory write offs of approximately  during the third quarter of severance costs in cost of sales were  and none in and  respectively 
we have implemented additional purchasing controls and have worked with our suppliers and customers to better time the delivery of our products 
we believe that these actions will assist us in improving our gross margins 
however  we may need to hire additional manufacturing personnel to address the increased volumes and bookings  which may cause us to incur start up costs with these personnel which may negatively impact margins in the short term 
research and development research and development r d expenses were million  million and million in  and respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  r d expenses were  and of total revenues in  and respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales in was due to cost saving measures implemented beginning in the fourth quarter of  including reduced use of outside consultants 
the increase in was due to the addition of significant capacity in our demonstration lab  which enabled us to compile customer demos of wafers in to days  increased usage of outside consultants and higher depreciation expenses 
severance costs in r d were   and none in  and  respectively 
going forward  we expect our r d expenses to be higher in to support customer requested new application development and higher investments in information and control systems 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million in  and respectively 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were  and in  and respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in was primarily due to higher legal expenses of million related to the asm lawsuit 
in addition  the company received sub leasing revenue of  that was offset against sg a expenses 
the company had minimal governmental grants and no sub leasing income in the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales in when compared to was primarily due to higher net sales in severance costs in sg a were   and none in  and  respectively 
going forward  we expect our sg a expenses to be higher due primarily to increased commissions as well as increased administrative expenses associated with enhanced reporting requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense interest expenses were million and  in and  respectively 
the increase in was due to an increase in net interest charges on bank loans of approximately  and interest cost of  relating to the convertible notes 
in connection with the convertible notes  the company expects to incur interest expense of million in the interest expense includes the accretion of the value of the beneficial conversion feature and amortization of issuance costs related to the convertible notes 
interest expenses were  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in was due to increased levels of debt outstanding in  compared to provision for income taxes we recorded tax expenses of   and  in  and  respectively  for our south korean subsidiary 
we did not record any provision for income taxes in the united states and japan  as we incurred losses in these entities 
we provide for a full valuation allowance against tax benefit associated with these losses 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in  we recorded a non recurring charge of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle due to the adoption of sab this amount represents the gross profit on systems that shipped during  but did not receive final customer acceptance during included in this number were systems and some upgrades  which had a total sales value of million 
in december  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales with an effective date of january  the company s selling arrangements generally involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
as a result  effective january   to comply with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company deferred recognition of revenue from such equipment sales until installation was complete and the product was accepted by the customer 
prior to the introduction of sab  the company recognized revenue related to systems upon shipment 
a provision for the estimated future cost of system installation  warranty and commissions was recorded when revenue was recognized 
the cumulative effect in prior years of the change in accounting method was a charge of million or per diluted share 
in the third quarter of  the company established verifiable objective evidence of fair value of installation services  one of the requirements for genus to recognize revenue for multi element arrangements prior to completion of installation services 
accordingly  under sab  if genus has met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  then the company recognizes equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title 
as a result  the total revenue recognized in for equipment sales where installation had not been completed and the system was not accepted was million 
service revenue is recognized when service has been completed over the duration of the contract 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  compared to million as of december  accounts receivable were million  an increase of million from million as of december   as the majority of our shipments occurred in the latter part of cash used in operating activities were million  million and million in  and respectively 
cash used in operating activities in consisted primarily of net loss of million  decreases in deferred revenues of million and accounts payable of million  and an increase in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by depreciation of million  provision for excess and obsolete inventory at million and an increase in customer advances of million 
cash used by operating activities totaled million  and consisted primarily of net loss of million and decreases in deferred revenues of million  partially offset by depreciation of million and reductions in receivables of million and reductions in inventories of million 
inventory reductions were primarily related to improved supply chain management  decreases in inventory held at customer sites from million to million and to reductions in shipment backlog  which reduced from million at the end of december to million on december  financing activities provided cash of million  million and million in  and respectively 
in january  the company received net proceeds of million in a private placement 
in august  the company received million  net of issuance costs  from the sale of subordinated convertible notes and warrants 
in addition  the company received million from warrant exercises and  from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities provided cash of million for in may  we received approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock and warrants for million additional shares of our common stock 
additionally  we increased our net short term borrowings by million 
we incurred capital expenditures of approximately  in and million in expenditures in were primarily related to the continuing program of upgrading existing equipment in our development and applications laboratories to meet our most advanced system capabilities and specifications  especially for our ald processes 
this has improved our product and film development capabilities  and increased our customer demonstration capabilities  which is critical in the sales process 
our primary source of funds at december  consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  and million of accounts receivable  most of which we have collected or expect to collect during the three months ending march  significant financing transactions completed since december  include the following on december  and as amended on march  and march   we maintained line of credit facilities from silicon valley bank for million  secured against eligible receivables and inventory 
the interest rate is prime plus per annum and the facility expires on june  the loan is collateralized by a first priority perfected security interest in our assets and has a covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth calculated as the excess of total assets over total liabilities adjusted to exclude intangible assets and balances receivable from officers or affiliates and to exclude debt subordinated to silicon valley bank of million 
as of december   there was million outstanding under this credit facility 
on january   we received gross proceeds of million under a secured loan with citicapital  a division of citigroup 
the loan is payable over months  accrues interest of per annum and is secured by two systems in our demonstration lab 
there was a  outstanding balance under this agreement at december  a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows amounts in thousands less than after total revolving year years years years silicon valley bank   citicapital convertible notes   operating leases  n a     in the event of a change of control in the company  the note holder may elect to receive repayment of the notes at a premium of as of february   our cash balance was million 
we believe that our existing working capital  credit lines and cash from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the next months 
accordingly  these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
we are actively marketing our existing and new products  which we believe will ultimately lead to profitable operations 
management believes that the cash resources and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet projected working capital  capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance the currently available funds will meet the company s cash requirements in the future  or  that any required additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us or at all  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and any additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
related party transactions a board member of the company is also a partner of wilson  sonsini  goodrich rosati  the general counsel of the company 
in  and  the company incurred   and  in legal costs  respectively  and paid approximately million   and  respectively  to wilson sonsini goodrich rosati 
at december   the company owed approximately  to wilson sonsini goodrich rosati 
our business activities with wilson  sonsini  goodrich rosati are at arms length 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to all entities 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of long lived assets  except for certain obligations of leases 
as used in this statement  a legal obligation is an obligation that a party is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law  stature  ordinance or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and early application is encouraged 
we will adopt sfas no 
during the first quarter ended march  the effect on adoption of sfas no 
will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin no 
requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin no 
are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provision of fin no 
for the year ended december  and we have not assessed the impact of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of eitf issue no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the estimate of the market value of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire our stock 
we have adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in our financial reports for the year ended december  and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions for our future quarterly financial reports 
as the adoption of this standard involves disclosures only  we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin no 
must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of fin no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only risks that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by  and the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of those risks 
you should also refer to the other information and our financial statements included in this k report and the related information incorporated by reference into this k report 
we have experienced losses over the last few years and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability we have experienced losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
while we believe our cash position is sufficient for the next twelve months  we cannot provide assurances that future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and allow us to service debt and repay any underlying indebtedness at maturity 
if we do not achieve the cash flows that we anticipate  we may not be able to meet our planned product release schedules and our forecast sales objectives 
in such event we will require additional financing to fund on going and planned operations and may need to implement further expense reduction measures  including  but not limited to  the sale of assets  the consolidation of operations  workforce reductions  and or the delay  cancellation or reduction of certain product development  marketing  licensing  or other operational programs 
some of these measures would require third party consents or approvals  including that of our bank  and we cannot provide assurances that these consents or approvals will be obtained 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to make additional financing arrangements on satisfactory terms  if at all  and our operations and liquidity would be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure our shareholders and investors that we will achieve profitability in fiscal and beyond  nor can we provide assurances that we will achieve the sales necessary to avoid further expense reductions in the future 
substantially all of our net sales come from a small number of large customers in  samsung electronics company  ltd  seagate technologies  inc  ibm  and asuka project accounted for    and of revenues  respectively 
in  samsung electronics company  ltd  read rite corporation  nec  infineon and scs accounted for    and of revenues  respectively 
in  samsung electronics company  ltd 
and micron technology  inc accounted for and of revenues  respectively 
the semiconductor manufacturing industry generally consists of a limited number of larger companies 
consequently  we expect that a significant portion of our future product sales will continue to be concentrated within a limited number of customers  even though we are making progress in reducing the concentration of our reliance on these customers through our strategy of product and customer diversification 
none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement with us requiring them to purchase our products 
in addition  sales to these customers may decrease in the future when they complete their current semiconductor equipment purchasing requirements 
if any of our customers were to encounter financial difficulties or become unable to continue to do business with us at or near current levels  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed 
customers may delay or cancel orders or may stop doing business with us for a number of reasons including customer departures from historical buying patterns  general market conditions  economic conditions  or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the industries that manufacture products utilizing integrated circuits 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for many components and subassemblies  and supply shortages or the loss of these suppliers could result in increased cost or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products 
we rely on third parties to manufacture the components used in our products 
some of our suppliers are sole or limited source 
in addition  some of these suppliers are relatively small undercapitalized companies that may have difficulties in raising sufficient funding to continue operations 
there are risks associated with the use of independent suppliers  including unavailability of or delays in obtaining adequate supplies of components and potentially reduced control of quality  production costs and timing of delivery 
we may experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components used in our products 
in addition  the use of alternate components may require design alterations  which may delay installation and increase product costs 
these components may not be available in the quantities required  on reasonable terms  or at all 
financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability 
any failures by these third parties to adequately perform may impair our ability to offer our existing products  delay the submission of products for regulatory approval  and impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis or otherwise impair our competitive position 
establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we were unable to continue to obtain components in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted 
we are subject to risks beyond our control or influence and are highly dependent on our international sales  particularly sales in asian countries export sales accounted for approximately  and of our total net sales in  and  respectively 
net sales to our south korean based customers accounted for approximately  and of total net sales in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales  including sales to south korea  will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
as a result  a significant portion of our net sales will be subject to risks  including unexpected changes in law or regulatory requirements  exchange rate volatility  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  military confrontation  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  extended payment terms  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing our subsidiaries  difficulties in managing foreign subsidiary operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our foreign sales are primarily denominated in us dollars and we do not engage in hedging transactions 
as a result  our foreign sales are subject to the risks associated with unexpected changes in exchange rates  which could increase the cost of our products to our customers and could lead these customers to delay or defer their purchasing decisions 
wherever currency devaluations occur abroad  our goods become more expensive for our customers in that country 
in addition  difficult economic conditions may limit capital spending by our customers 
these circumstances may also affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  resulting in the cancellations or deferrals of existing orders and the limitation of additional orders 
our sales reflect the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly and could cause us to fail to achieve anticipated sales our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
although we are marketing our atomic layer deposition technology to non semiconductor markets such as markets in magnetic thin film heads  flat panel displays  micro electromechanical systems and inkjet printers  we are still dependent on sales to semiconductor manufacturers 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical which impacts the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment 
semiconductor industry downturns have significantly decreased our revenues  operating margins and results of operations in the past 
during the industry downturn in  several of our customers delayed or cancelled investments in new manufacturing facilities and equipment due to declining dram prices  the asian economic downturn  and general softening of the semiconductor market 
this caused our sales in to be significantly lower than in the prior three years 
after the dramatic industry boom for semiconductor equipment that peaked early in the year  another cyclical downturn is presently occurring 
the sharp and severe industry downturn in was the largest in the industry s history 
almost all previous downturns have been solely due to pricing declines 
however  the downturn in the industry marked a corresponding decline in unit production  as well as price reduction 
we expect that our revenues will continue to be further impacted by the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry and global economy  which may prevent us from increasing our revenues and achieving profitability 
our future growth is dependent on acceptance of new products and market acceptance of our systems relating to those products we believe that our future growth will depend in large part upon the acceptance of our new thin films and processes  especially our atomic layer deposition technology 
as a result  we expect to continue to invest in research and development in these new thin films and the systems that use these films 
there can be no assurance that the market will accept our new products or that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a timely manner to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so  or even a delay in our introduction of new products or enhancements  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products could harm sales of existing products 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of equipment used to chemically deposit tungsten silicide in the manufacture of memory chips 
we estimate that the life cycle for these tungsten silicide deposition systems is three to ten years 
there is a risk that future technologies  processes or product developments may render our product offerings obsolete and we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner or at all 
we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry against competitors with greater resources the semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive  we will require significant financial resources to develop new products  offer a broader range of products  establish and maintain customer service centers and invest in research and development 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources  more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  customer service capabilities and greater name recognition 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics 
if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering thin film products similar to those sold by us  it would materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products to such manufacturers 
in addition  to expand our sales we must often replace the systems of our competitors or sell new systems to customers of our competitors 
our competitors may develop new or enhanced competitive products that will offer price or performance features that are superior to our systems 
our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their product lines 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if our resources do not allow us to respond effectively to such competitive forces 
we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth if we are not selected as vendor of choice for new or expanded fabrication facilities and if our systems and products do not achieve broader market acceptance because semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor fabrication facility  these manufacturers will tend to choose semiconductor equipment manufacturers based on established relationships  product compatibility and proven system performance 
once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular vendor s capital equipment  the manufacturer generally relies for a significant period of time upon equipment from this vendor of choice for the specific production line application 
to do otherwise creates risk for the manufacturer because the manufacture of a semiconductor requires many process steps and a fabrication facility will contain many different types of machines that must work cohesively to produce products that meet the customers specifications 
if any piece of equipment fails to perform as expected  the customer could incur significant costs related to defective products  production line downtime  or low production yields 
since most new fabrication facilities are similar to existing ones  semiconductor manufacturers tend to continue using equipment that has a proven track record 
based on our experience with major customers like samsung  we have observed that once a particular piece of equipment is selected from a vendor  the customer is likely to continue purchasing that same piece of equipment from the vendor for similar applications in the future 
our customer list  though limited  has expanded in recent months 
yet our broadening market share remains at risk due to choices made by customers that continue to be influenced by pre existing installed bases by competing vendors 
consequently  our penetrating these markets and our ability to get additional orders may be limited 
a semiconductor manufacturer frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  we may face narrow windows of opportunity to be selected as the vendor of choice by potential new customers 
it may be difficult for us to sell to a particular customer for a significant period of time once that customer selects a competitor s product  and we may not be successful in obtaining broader acceptance of our systems and technology 
if we are not able to achieve broader market acceptance of our systems and technology  we may be unable to grow our business and our operating results and financial condition will be harmed 
our lengthy sales cycle increases our costs and reduces the predictability of our revenue sales of our systems depend upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity 
that decision typically involves a significant capital commitment by our customers 
accordingly  the purchase of our systems typically involves time consuming internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and introduction of new technologies into our customers manufacturing facilities 
for many potential customers  an evaluation as to whether new semiconductor manufacturing equipment is needed typically occurs infrequently 
following an evaluation by the customer as to whether our systems meet its qualification criteria  we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future delays in finalizing system sales while the customer evaluates and receives approval for the purchase of our systems and constructs a new facility or expands an existing facility 
due to these factors  our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort 
the time between our first contact with a customer and the customer placing its first order typically lasts from nine to twelve months and is often longer 
this lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to accurately forecast future sales and may cause our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
if anticipated sales from a particular customer are not realized in a particular period due to this lengthy sales cycle  our operating results may be adversely affected for that period 
if we are found to infringe the patents or intellectual property of other parties  our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 
from time to time  we may receive notices from third parties alleging infringement of patents or intellectual property rights 
it is our policy to respect all parties legitimate intellectual property rights  and we will defend against such claims or negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms where appropriate 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to negotiate any such necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
litigation is time consuming  expensive and its outcome is uncertain 
we may not prevail in any litigation in which we are involved 
should we be found to infringe any of the patents asserted or any other intellectual property rights of others  in addition to potential monetary damages and any injunctive relief granted  we may need either to obtain a license to commercialize our products or redesign our products so they do not infringe any third party s intellectual property 
if we are unable to obtain a license or adopt a non infringing product design  we may not be able to proceed with development  manufacture and sale or our atomic layer products 
in this case our business may not develop as planned  and our results could materially suffer 
on june   asm america  inc asma filed a patent infringement action against genus 
asma s complaint alleges that genus is directly and indirectly infringing us patent no 
 the patent  entitled sequential chemical vapor deposition  and us patent no 
 the patent entitled method for growing thin films  which asma claims to own or exclusively license 
the complaint seeks monetary and injunctive relief 
genus served its answer to asma s complaint on august  also on august   genus counterclaimed against asma and asm international  nv asmi for infringement of us patent no 
 the patent entitled method of selective etching native oxide  declaratory judgment that the and patents are invalid  unenforceable  and not infringed by genus  and antitrust violations 
an initial case management conference was held on october  on january   the court issued an order granting asma leave to amend its complaint to add an individual as a party and to add a claim that genus is directly and indirectly infringing us patent no 
 the patent entitled apparatus for chemical vapor deposition using an axially symmetric gas flow  which asma claims to own 
the court also severed and stayed discovery and trial of genus antitrust claims until after trial of the patent claims 
on february   genus served its amended answer to asma s amended complaint and counterclaimed against asma for declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid  unenforceable  and not infringed by genus 
on august   the court issued a claim construction order regarding the   and patents 
a claim construction hearing regarding the patent was held on september   and the court issued a claim construction ruling regarding this patent on november  on september  genus filed motions for summary judgment on noninfringement regarding the and patents 
on november   the court granted genus motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent 
on january   the court granted genus motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent 
a hearing for dispositive motions on the remaining patent claims in the case is currently set for june   and trial on those claims is currently set for january  we intend to defend our position vigorously 
we are dependent upon key personnel who are employed at will  who would be difficult to replace and whose loss would impede our development and sales we are highly dependent on key personnel to manage our business  and their knowledge of business  management skills and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of dr 
william wr elder  our chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
thomas e 
seidel  our chief technology officer  and other key managerial and technical employees who would be difficult to replace 
the loss of dr 
elder or dr 
seidel or other key employees could limit or delay our ability to develop new products and adapt existing products to our customers evolving requirements and would also result in lost sales and diversion of management resources 
none of our executive officers are bound by a written employment agreement  and the relationships with our officers are at will 
because of competition for additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel  which could impede development or sales of our products 
our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced engineering  technical  financial  sales and marketing personnel in our industry 
in particular  we must attract and retain highly skilled design and process engineers 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are based 
if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel  or attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and market our products and perform services for our customers 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products to customers  or fail to meet delivery commitments or experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in substantial liability to us we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment 
these include laws  rules and regulations governing the use  storage  discharge  release  treatment and disposal of hazardous chemicals during and after manufacturing  research and development and sales demonstrations 
if we fail to comply with present or future regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  property damage  personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
we use the following regulated gases at our manufacturing facility in sunnyvale tungsten hexafluoride  dichlorosilane silicide  silane and nitrogen 
we also use regulated liquids such as hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid 
the city of sunnyvale  california  imposes high environmental standards to businesses operating within the city 
genus has received an operating license from sunnyvale 
presently  our compliance record indicates that our methods and practices successfully meet standards 
moving forward  if we fail to continuously maintain high standards to prevent the leakage of any toxins from our facilities into the environment  restrictions on our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be imposed upon us or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
we depend upon six independent sales representatives for the sale of our products and any disruption in these relationships would adversely affect us we currently sell and support our thin film products through direct sales and customer support organizations in the united states  europe  south korea and japan and through six independent sales representatives and distributors in the united states  europe  south korea  taiwan  china and malaysia 
we do not have any long term contracts with our sales representatives and distributors 
any disruption or termination of our existing distributor relationships could negatively impact sales and revenue 
we established a direct sales organization in japan and we may not succeed in effectively penetrating the japanese marketplace we terminated our relationship with our distributor  innotech corp 
in japan in in  we invested significant resources in japan by establishing a direct sales organization  genus japan  inc to date  we have had limited success in penetrating in japanese semiconductor industry 
although we continue to invest significant resources in our japan office  we may not be able to attract new customers in the japanese semiconductor industry  and as a result  we may fail to yield a profit or return on our investment in japan 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which may lead to losses by investors or to securities litigation our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our  our competitors or our customers actual or anticipated financial results  our competitors or our customers announcements of technological innovations  revenue recognition policies  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and other events or factors 
also  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of many technology companies  in particular  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic and political conditions in the united states and the countries in which we do business  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
a disaster could severely damage our ability to deliver our products to our customers 
our products depend on our ability to maintain and protect our operating equipment and computer systems  which are primarily located in or near our principal headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
sunnyvale exists near a known earthquake fault zone 
although our facilities are designed to be fault tolerant  the systems are susceptible to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  and similar events 
although we maintain general business insurance against interruptions such as fires and floods  there can be no assurance that the amount of coverage will be adequate in any particular case 
we are obligated to issue shares of our stock under outstanding options and warrants and such issuance will dilute your percentage ownership in genus as of january   we have approximately of  shares of common stock underlying warrants and outstanding employee stock options 
of the stock options   shares are exercisable as of january  all of the shares underlying the warrants are currently exercisable 
some warrants have terms providing for an adjustment of the number of shares underlying the warrants in the event that we issue new shares at a price lower than the exercise price of the warrants  where we make a distribution of common stock to our shareholders or effect a reclassification 
if all of the shares underlying the exercisable options and warrants were exercised and sold in the public market  the value of your current holdings in genus may decline because there may not be sufficient demand to purchase the increased number of shares that would be available for sale 
we have implemented anti takeover measures that may result in diluting your percentage ownership of genus stock on september   the company s board of directors declared a dividend pursuant to a newly adopted share purchase rights plan  which replaced a similar earlier plan that had expired on july  the intended purpose of the rights plan is to protect shareholders rights and to maximize share value in the event of an unfriendly takeover attempt 
as of the record date of october   each share of common stock of genus  inc outstanding was granted one right under the new plan 
each right is exercisable only under certain circumstances and upon the occurrence of certain events and permits the holder to purchase from the company one one thousandth of a share of series c participating preferred stock at an initial exercise price of forty dollars per one one thousandth share 
the  shares of series c preferred stock authorized in connection with the rights plan will be used for the exercise of any preferred shares purchase rights in the event that any person or group the acquiring person acquires beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding common stock 
in such event  the shareholders other than the acquiring person would receive common stock of the company having a market value of twice the exercise price 
subject to certain restrictions  the company may redeem the rights issued under the rights plan for per right and may amend the rights plan without the consent of rights holders 
the rights will expire on october   unless redeemed by the company 
in the event that circumstances trigger the transferability and exercisability of rights granted in our rights plan  your current holdings in genus may decline as a result of dilution to your percentage ownership in genus or as a result of a reduction in the per share value of our stock resulting from the increase in the number of outstanding shares available and your failure to exercise your rights under the rights plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk approximately of our revenues are us dollar denominated sales 
consequently  fluctuations in our exchange rate could make our products relatively more expensive to our customers  which could lead to reduced demand for our products 
similarly  of our sales are denominated in non us based currencies 
as exchange rates fluctuate  our revenues from sales of foreign currency denominated products will fluctuate which could have an adverse impact on our margins 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have both fixed rate and floating rate interest obligations 
fixed rate obligations may result in interest expenses in excess of market rates if interest rates fall  while floating rate obligations may result in additional interest costs if interest rates rise 
an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would not materially impact the results of our operations 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents or increase any interest expense owed on the line of credit facility 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rates exposures
